NCT02464748,MND is often referred to as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease.,ALS
NCT00362362,"OBJECTIVE:||The causes of sporadic motor neuron diseases, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are unknown. Genes have been identified for some forms of familial motor neuron diseases. We don't know whether genes also play a role in sporadic motor neuron disease, for example through risk-factor genes or by the interaction of multiple genes as a complex genetic disorder. Identification of genetic contributions to sporadic motor neuron diseases requires analysis of DNA from patients.||The goal of this protocol is to collect blood samples from patients with motor neuron disease for creation of cell lines to bank in a repository created through an NINDS initiative. The cell lines will be used for DNA extraction. The repository provides anonymized samples of patient DNA or cell lines to investigators who are seeking to define genetic causes, contributions, and susceptibilities to neurological disorders. DNA and cell lines created from the blood sample are stripped of patient identifiers and stored indefinitely. A limited amount of clinical data, termed the clinical data elements, will be available for each coded sample. The samples will only be available for research. The results of testing will not be communicated to the patient.||STUDY POPULATION:||All patients will be enrolled in a primary protocol for the study of motor neuron diseases at NIH. This protocol will serve as a secondary protocol for sample collection and reporting of clinical data elements. Patients with Primary lateral sclerosis must meet the diagnostic criteria for PLS proposed by Pringle and patients with ALS must fulfill the revised El Escorial criteria for probable or definite ALS.||DESIGN:||Determination of diagnosis and eligibility will be carried out as part of the primary protocol. Patients will be informed of the DNA sample repository and its purpose. After informed consent is obtained, 2 tubes of blood will be drawn and assigned a unique identifier code. The coded samples, and a clinical data element form will then be sent to the repository, which will extract DNA and prepare cell lines. The identities of the subjects will not be stored. An aliquot of the sample will be forwarded to the associate investigator to look for disease associations with genetic markers.||OUTCOME MEASURES:||There is no specific outcome measure for this protocol. The samples will be made accessible to a wide variety of researchers seeking to determine the causes of motor neuron diseases and other neurological disorders through the repository's contract with NINDS.",ALS
NCT03154450,"Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) use in patients with motor neurone disease (MND) who develop respiratory failure can improve symptoms and survival. Initiation of NIV can be difficult for patients and those who do not adequately adhere to the regime fail to gain benefit. This study will evaluate the use of EncoreAnywhere: a system which collects data on NIV use and effectiveness from the NIV machines and transmits it to the MND care team for review.||This study is a pilot, feasibility study. It is a randomised controlled trial comparing the use of EncoreAnywhere with usual care. Up to 40 patients with MND about to start NIV will be recruited. All patients will have the EncoreAnywhere system installed on their NIV machine for the first three months of NIV use. Half the patients will be randomised to the intervention arm which will allow the MND care team to review the information sent from the device regularly during the study. Data will be collected from the other patients but not reviewed by the clinical team. All patients will receive usual care.||Data will be collected by three methods. Data collected from the EncoreAnywhere system will examine adherence and effectiveness of ventilation. The main outcome of interest is adherence to NIV at three months. Data will be collected from patients (patient symptoms and quality of life) using questionnaires (at baseline, one and three months) and collected from information recorded in the patients' notes as part of usual care. Data will also be collected to examine feasibility e.g. recruitment and retention rates. A subset of patients will be invited to undergo overnight oximetry at 1 and 3 months to examine NIV effectiveness.||The aims of the research are to establish the level of adherence and effectiveness of NIV during initiation and factors that may impact on adherence and effectiveness and also evaluate the feasibility and impact using EncoreAnywhere on the Sheffield MND team working pattern, the clinical and cost implications for a full service.",ALS
NCT03487263,"The objectives of this study are to determine:||The safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of IC14 in patients with motor neurone disease (MND).|The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IC14 in patients with MND.|The preliminary effect of IC14 on the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) in patients with MND.|The preliminary effect of IC14 on forced vital capacity (FVC) and other clinical markers of disease severity in patients with MND.|The preliminary effect of IC14 on patient-reported outcome measures.|The preliminary effect of IC14 on disease biomarkers.||Ten patients with MND will be sequentially assigned to receive one of two dose regimens of IC14 in an unblinded manner:||For the initial 3 patients: IC14 at a dosage of 2 mg/kg on Study Day 1, then 1 mg/kg once daily on Study Days 3-5 for 4 total doses.|For the subsequent 7 patients: IC14 at a dosage of 4 mg/kg on Study Day 1, then 2 mg/kg once daily on Study Days 2-4 for 4 total doses.||Study participation will continue until 28 days after the last dose of study drug.",ALS
NCT04454892,"With the development of supportive measures, the natural history of ALS has changed. Researchers compared the natural history of ALS patients from 1999-2004 and 1984-1998 and found that the median survival time was significantly longer in the former than in the latter (4.32 years vs. 3.22 years) and that the disease progression was slower in the former, even after adjusting for other confounding factors. Although previous studies have provided reference for the diagnosis and treatment of ALS, the etiology of ALS is still unknown, and the relevant clinical features and natural history of ALS still lack the verification of large samples. Therefore, the research on the natural history of ALS is of great significance to further increase the understanding of ALS and provide new evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of ALS.",ALS
NCT02852278,"The patient activities of daily living for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis survey (PADL-ALS, Appendix B) is a patient-centric revision of the standard revised ALS functional rating scale used in clinical trials, the ALSFRS-R. The PADL-ALS was developed based on patient interviews, and patient focus groups. The ALSFRS-R is made up of 12 categories detailing various activities of daily living and includes six bulbar-respiratory functions, three upper extremity functions (writing, cutting food, and dressing), and three gross motor functions (walking, climbing, and turning in bed). Each activity is recorded to the closest approximation from a list of five choices, scored 0-4, with the total score ranging from 48 (normal function) to 0 (no function). The PADL-ALS includes questions from the ALSFRS-R, with revisions to make the questions easier to understand. In addition the PADL-ALS contains a question about pain; a question about emotional lability; and a general non-denominational question about faith. The survey will be composed of two parts, the initial survey, and then monthly follow up surveys. The initial survey will include the PADL-ALS with additional questions about symptom onset, date of diagnosis, initial region involved, patient impression of diagnosis, general demographic questions (age, gender, race, ethnicity, education), and medications related to their diagnosis of motor neuron disease.||The survey data will be stored by the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network's Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida. Upon conclusion of the study period, the data will be sent to Jeffrey Statland, MD, University of Kansas Medical Center (Study Chair) and Michael Benatar, MD, PhD, University of Miami (CReATe Consortium PI). All data collected will be sent to the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) to be stored indefinitely.",ALS
NCT01776970,"CANALS project has as a main objective to analyse the safety profile, tolerability and efficacy of a Cannabis Sativa (Sativex) derivative on patients affected by spasticity due to motor neuron disease.||Muscular rigidity (or spasticity) is a symptom that affects many patients with motor neuron disease, concurring to reduce personal autonomy, patients' quality of life and can potentially cause secondary symptomatology (as pain or secondary muscular retractions). Currently available anti-spasticity drugs are often unsatisfactory and their pharmacological action can cause weakness as a secondary effect. There many arguments supporting the use of cannabinoid derivatives in motor neuron diseases. Cannabinoids receptor is expresses both in the brain and in the spinal cord. In animal models cannabinoids have an anti-spasticity effect. Moreover recent studies on ALS animal models demonstrated a neuroprotective effect of cannabinoids, including the preservation of the motor ability and a survival increase of the treated animals. Recently many clinical trials (some of them performed at the Neurological Division of San Raffaele Hospital) demonstrated cannabinoid efficacy on spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis patients. CAnnabinois would be able to reduce spasticity with no secondary weakness effect on treated patients. The results of these studies led to the drug approval in certain countries and by the European Community for the treatment of spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis.||The aim of this study is to analyze the safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of a Cannabis Sativa (Sativex) derivative on patients affected by spasticity due to motor neuron disease ( Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Primary Lateral Sclerosis). The study will be performed along 7 weeks. During the first week will be asked patients to note down in the clinical diary elements related to their symptomatology. Afterwards patients will be randomized in two groups: drug-treated and placebo treated. The study will be followed by a 6-weeks open-label phase during which all patients will receive the active drug (Phase B)",ALS

NCT01143428,"Objective||Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are motor neuron disorders with different phenotypes that progress at very different rates. ALS is a rapidly progressive disease with a median survival less than 5 years. Patients with PLS have a slowly progressive course with a normal lifespan. One hypothesis is that oxidative stress affects the way in which different motor neuron disorders progress. To test this hypothesis, exposures to putative triggers of oxidative stress and biomarkers that may reflect oxidative stress will be assessed in patients with motor neuron disorders. A multicenter effort (the COSMOS study) has been initiated to accumulate sufficient numbers of ALS patients to address this hypothesis. As an add-on study, PLS patients will also be assessed in the multicenter effort. The objective of this protocol is to enroll PLS patients in this multicenter effort. The goal is to assess environmental factors and markers of oxidative stress in patients with established PLS.||Study Population||15 adult patients with PLS who have symptoms of pure upper motor neuron dysfunction for at least 5 but not more than 15 years.||Design||Patients will undergo a standard battery of clinical, physiological, and cognitive screening tests at enrollment, with scheduled follow-up evaluation visits every 12 months for 36 months. Blood and urine samples will be sent to collaborators at Columbia University for analysis of markers of oxidative injury and genetic risk factors. Patients will complete a self-administered nutritional survey and will be interviewed by phone by Columbia University investigators using questionnaires to assess environmental, occupational, lifestyle and psychosocial factors thought to be triggers of oxidative stress.||Outcome Measures||The Columbia University collaborators will combine data from several centers in a regression model correlating the slope of decline of the ALS-FRS score with an index of oxidative stress.",ALS
NCT02360891,"This is a prospective observational multicentric French study of a cohort of 1000 ALS patients, 100 neurological controls and 200 healthy controls followed from the first signs to the end of the disease.||The aim of the present study is therefore to determine the clinical, biological, imaging, and electrophysiological biomarkers of prognosis of survival without events (i.e. severe comorbidity, 24 hours of non invasive ventilation, tracheotomy).||Secondary objectives will notably include i) the biomarkers of disease progression ii) biomarkers of diagnosis as compared with controls iii) the determination of the different endophenotypes according to the prognosis, the genetic profiles and the initial clinical presentations. Criteria of assessment will notably include detailed medical history, habitus, past and present treatments, vascular risk factors, ALSFRS-R, muscular testing, respiratory parameters including early nocturnal saturation and apneal profile, the detailed and predetermined clinical presentations, extensive cognitive and behavioral examination, extensive blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urines biological tests, genetic analyses, multiple brain and spinal MRI sequences, and electrophysiological tests (i.e. electromyogram, MUNIX, triple stimulation). Invasive tests will be optional (i.e. lumbar puncture, skin biopsies, muscular biopsies).||The large number of patients will allow in depth statistical analyses, notably to establish decisional trees (CHAID).",ALS
NCT02166944,"The investigators will assess the ALSFR-s in ALS patients at start, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months and correlate the score to the neurological outcome of the patients with and without tamoxifen treatment at dose of 40mg daily for one year.||The study will be able to prove the investigators hypothesis: Tamoxifen, a protease and autophagy enhancer, has synergic effect with riluzole in ALS patients to slowing the progression of neurological dysfunction, and respiratory insufficiency.",ALS
NCT03444428,"The stiffness of the arterial wall is highly relevant to cardiovascular disease. Large elastic arteries and smaller muscular conduit arteries become stiffer with ageing, a process that is accelerated in the presence of cardiovascular disease. Arterial stiffness increases also with various disease states, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and kidney disease. Numerous techniques have been developed to measure arterial stiffness, either in single vessels or in entire muscular arterial trees. These techniques have increasingly been shown to improve stratification of cardiovascular risk and risk reduction beyond that provided by conventional risk factors. Furthermore, large artery stiffness, measured via carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, independently predicts the risk of cardiovascular events in both clinical and community-based cohorts.||Abnormalities in arterial stiffness have been noted in disorders characterized by hypoxia with or without hypercapnia. These abnormalities could be driven by the risk factors for those conditions (e.g. cigarette smoke, obesity). In COPD, all studies are consistent showing a significant increase in arterial stiffness compared with ex-smokers without airway obstruction and nonsmoker healthy control subjects. The severity of airway obstruction is consistently related to arterial stiffness in COPD. Furthermore, airflow limitation arising from cigarette smoking, but not airflow limitation in non-smokers, was associated with arterial stiffness in a general population independently of established risk factors. The presence of OSA was associated with higher arterial stiffness indices independent of major confounders. In this context, OSA is associated with increased arterial stiffness independent of blood pressure.||Non invasive ventilation has been shown to reduce arterial stiffness in obstructive sleep apnea. In particular, there are studies that have examined the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on arterial stiffness (measured with pulse wave velocity) in OSA patients. Other studies have examined changes in arterial stiffness (measured with other than pulse wave velocity method) after treatment of OSA with CPAP. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge no investigation exists on the impact of non invasive bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation on arterial stiffness in neuromuscular disease.||The Lane Fox Unit, the UK's largest weaning, rehabilitation and home ventilation unit, is treating neuromuscular patients. In neuromuscular disease, especially in MND, confounding factors as obesity, cigarette smoke, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus can be excluded. This gives the opportunity to determine whether hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia alone cause arterial stiffness. Furthermore, in this pilot study it will be investigated whether non invasive ventilation has any effect on arterial stiffness in MND patients.",ALS

The main outcome indicators are the record of adverse reactions and the rate of change of amyotrophic lateral sclerosisFunctional Rating Scale score. The secondary outcome indicators include survival time-time to the end event (death, tracheotomy, continuous ventilator dependence), forced vital capacity (FVC), recognition Knowledge function evaluation (ECAS score).",ALS
NCT00818389,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder that results in progressive wasting and paralysis of voluntary muscles.||In this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, researchers will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drug lithium given in combination with riluzole, a drug commonly used to treat ALS, compared to a placebo given in combination with riluzole.||Approximately 250 participants will be recruited from multiple centers, in the US and Canada, that belong to the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) and the Canadian ALS Clinical Trials and Research Network (CALS). Enrollment will occur in stages. Initially 84 participants will be enrolled in the trial. An interim analysis using available data will occur after the 84th participant is enrolled. During this time, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) appointed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) may decide to stop the trial for efficacy or futility reasons or to stop enrollment and request that follow-up continue with the 84 participants already enrolled in the trial, or the DSMB may decide to continue enrollment.||Participants will be randomized to one of two arms of the study. Arm one will receive lithium and riluzole. Arm two will receive riluzole and placebo (an inactive substance). All participants will be receiving riluzole. After screening and randomization, participants will be followed every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks. Subsequent in-person visits will occur every 8 weeks with a final visit at week 52. Between in-person visits, telephone interviews will take place every 4 weeks to administer the Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) questionnaire. A follow-up telephone interview will occur at week 56 (off study medication) to review adverse events. The primary outcome measure is disease progression as measured by the ALSFRS-R questionnaire. Participants randomized to placebo whose disease progresses will be crossed over to lithium for the remaining period of the study (up to 52 weeks total).||Duration of the study for participants is 56 weeks which includes 52 weeks of treatment and a followup telephone interview at week 56.",ALS
NCT00324454,"Cramps in MNDs are believed to occur as a result of high-frequency burst firing of alpha motor neurons. Levetiracetam inhibits burst firing in epileptic rat hippocampus. Levetiracetam has never been tested against cramps in humans; however, it has helped another condition believed to result from burst firing of a motor nerve: hemi-facial spasm.||The mechanisms underlying spasticity in MNDs likely involve imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory influences on the alpha motor neurons. Levetiracetam may modulate these influences in a number of ways, including reducing the effects of zinc and beta-carbolines in GABA and glycine receptors. Levetiracetam reduces phasic (but not tonic) spasticity in patients with multiple-sclerosis.||Levetiracetam may have neuroprotective properties. In a model of cerebral ischemia induced by occlusion of the rat internal carotid artery, pre-treatment with levetiracetam reduced infarct size in a dose-dependent manner. In rats injected with kainic acid to induce calcium overload, oxidative stress and neurotoxicity, pretreatment with levetiracetam offset kainic acid's effects. The mechanisms for these effects may relate to levetiracetam's ability to influence calcium currents, or its ability to increase the release of growth factors from astrocytes, mechanisms that would be relevant in MNDs. Levetiracetam's ability to inhibit histone deacetylase may also help slow MNDs progression.||OBJECTIVES: 1. Assess the safety and tolerability of levetiracetam over 9 months in patients with MNDs. 2. Determine whether treatment with levetiracetam is associated with a reduction in cramps, spasticity or motor neuron disease progression.||METHODS:Open-label, Phase 2 trial of 20 adult patients with MNDs (ALS, PLS or PMA) at Duke University ALS Clinic. Eligible patients have cramps with average severity 50/100 points, are able to provide informed consent, have normal renal functions and are on a stable riluzole dose. Exclusions include pregnancy, unstable mental illness, dementia, drug abuse or non-compliance. The first 3 months of the study are a baseline period. Over the remaining 9 months, patients take levetiracetam at increasing doses up to 3000mg per day. Outcome measures include adverse events, tolerability,cramp-pain-severity score, cramp-frequency score, modified Ashworth Spasticity Score, Penn Spasm Score, FVC, ALSFRS-R and MMT.",ALS
NCT04518540,"In this proposed study, the investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Lipoic acid in treatment of ALS. The study will recruit 150 ALS patients, then these patients will be randomized to lipoic acid group or control group (75 patients per arm) for 6 courses for about 5 months. Clinical efficacy and safety assessment will be done at screen/baseline, 3th course and 6th course. The specific aims are to compare lipoic acid versus placebo on: (1) Lipoic acid could improve the motor function, delay the disease progression and extend survival time in patients with ALS, measured by the ALSFRS-R Scale, ROADS Scale, upper motor neuron Scale, Muscle strength Scale and Electromyography; (2) Lung function will be collected to prove the hypothesis lipoic acid may help respiratory function.

NCT01950910,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons, muscle atrophy and paralysis. There is no reliable early diagnostic test for ALS making identification of the disease difficult at its earliest stages. Early detection is critical to the initiation of early neuroprotective therapy. By the time a reliable diagnosis can be made, substantial damage to motor neurons and muscle has already occurred. The purpose of the current project is to establish a bank of blood samples (serum and protein/RNA/DNA from blood cells) and CSF for use in the development of an early diagnostic test for ALS and to better understand the progression of this disease.||Samples from patients that have a confirmed or unknown diagnosis of motor neuron disease will be examined. ALS and suspected neuromuscular disease (control) samples will be collected for comparison. Investigators will examine various biochemical, metabolic and genetic markers from these samples in hopes of finding differences in the expression between control subjects and ALS patients and how these biomarkers vary during disease progression. Participants will be asked to complete an optional questionnaire to collect data including medication and vitamin use and medical and disease history. This data will be linked to the patient's samples; however, all samples will be deidentified and coded to avoid the possibility of linking results to the patient. Results will not be stored in the patient's medical record.",ALS
NCT03705390,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) belongs to a wider group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases and mainly involves the nerve cells (neurons) in the body. Voluntary muscles produce movements like chewing, walking and talking. ALS is caused by gradual deterioration (degeneration) and death of these motor neurons. The disease is progressive, meaning the symptoms get worse over time and most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3 to 5 years from when the symptoms first appear. Currently there is no cure for ALS and no effective treatment to halt or reverse the progression of the disease (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Fact Sheet).||The aim of this study is to explore the safety and acceptability of a type of low molecular weight dextran sulfate called ILB.||The investigators will invite 15 patients to take part from a single centre in the UK. Participants will be closely monitored for any side-effects; for changes in ALS symptoms and on quality of life during and after the study.||The trial period for patient participation is maximum 56 weeks (12 months), ILB injections will be administered once weekly for up to a maximum of 48 weeks.",ALS
NCT03293394,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease, which is a group of neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body. The disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body due to the degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons. Current drugs approved for ALS treatment only modestly slow disease progression.||Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique, which has been demonstrated to modulate cerebral excitability in several neurodegenerative disorders and modulate intracortical connectivity measures.||In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study, the investigators will evaluate whether a two-weeks' treatment with bilateral motor cortex anodal tDCS and spinal cathodal tDCS can improve symptoms in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and modulate intracortical connectivity, at short and long term.||Subjects will be randomized in two groups, one receiving a 10 day (5 days/week for 2 weeks) treatment with anodal bilateral motor cortex tDCS and cathodal spinal tDCS and the other receiving sham stimulation with identical parameters. After the intervention, patients will be reassessed with a clinical and neurophysiological evaluation at 2 weeks, 2 months and 6 months after treatment. Furthermore, blood neurofilaments will be measured at each time point.||Clinical evaluation will include the ALSFRS-R, ALSAQ-40, CBI, EQ-5D-5L, muscle strength evaluated with the MRC scale.||Neurophysiological evaluation will include measures of intracortical connectivity, evaluated with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI-ICF), long interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF).",ALS

It takes place in the outpatient unit of the Department of Neurology, and includes interventions by the multidisciplinary team of the "" Center for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and related diseases "". This new tracking method can help improving quality of life of patients and their families by adapting medical care, proposing communication aids, facilitating access to specialized examinations and anticipating pulmonary, nutritional and neurologic complications. Moreover, it speeds up administrative procedures, improves the flow of information between medical teams inside and outside the hospital and it allows and encourages discussion about advanced directives.||Since June 2012, the multidisciplinary follow-up is monitored through a Cohort study that was approved by the ethical committee (NAC 11-062R).

The ALS patients will be divided into 2 subsets on the basis of a preliminary neuropsychological work-up, according to the presence or absence of ""subclinical cognitive impairment"" as defined by abnormal scoring on tests not meeting the criteria for dementia. In a second testing session carried out at the same time, a comprehensive assessment of memory, behaviour and emotional changes will be done. All subjects will then undergo morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting-state functional MRI and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET). Whenever possible, a second testing session will be carried out 9 to 12 months later in order to quantify the cognitive deterioration, if any, and to find early predictors of the evolution towards dementia. In deceased patients, the location and extent of neuronal loss will be determined, as well as the location and number of UBIs.||Results and clinical relevance : this study is intended to improve our knowledge of the clinical phenotype of ALS, and particularly to learn more about the extent of cognitive, behavioural and emotional changes in this disease.

NCT01730716,"These stem cells are called Human Spinal Stem Cells (HSSC) and have been engineered from the spinal cord of a single fetus electively aborted after 8 weeks of gestation. The tissue was obtained with the mother's consent. The cells will be transplanted into the ALS patient's spinal cord after laminectomy, an operation that removes bone surrounding the spine. After the spinal cord is exposed, a device manufactured for this purpose will be mounted onto the patient and will hold a syringe filled with the cells. The syringe will have a needle attached and the needle will enter the spinal cord at 5-10 locations injecting the cells. The device will minimize trauma to the spinal cord by the needle by making the puncture precise and steady and injecting the material at a slow and steady speed.||ALS is a universally fatal neurodegenerative condition that causes weakness leading to paralysis and death. Life expectancy is 2-5 years. The cause is unknown and there is no effective treatment. Previous research has shown that on autopsy, ALS patients are found to have increased levels of the amino acid glutamate accumulated in the brain and spinal cord. This increase is thought to be caused by a decrease in the glutamate transporter which normally ""cleans up"" glutamate from the cells. HSSC are known to express amino acid transporters and it is hoped that this action will reduce the toxicity of accumulated glutamate and benefit ALS patients. There is a second hypothesized benefit of the HSSC and that is their ability to secrete neurotrophic support factors. Neurotrophic factors support the health of nerves.||There will be 5 sequential cohorts (Groups A - E) with 3 subjects in each cohort. New patients will be enrolled into each group. No control group is included. All subjects will receive spinal cord injections of HSSC. All subjects will also be ambulatory with respiratory function greater than or equal to 50% supine and 60% seated of predicted normal and will receive bilateral injections at the C3 through C5 cervical segments. Subjects in Group E will receive bilateral injections at the L2 through L5 lumbar segments and then return approximately one-three months later to receive bilateral injections at the C3 through C5 cervical segments.||The dose escalation plan is as follows:||Group A: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to receive bilateral C3 through C4 injections of 2x106 cells (10 injections x 2x105 cells/ injection)|Group B: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to receive bilateral C3 through C5 injections of 4x106 cells (20 injections x 2x105 cells/ injection)|Group C: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to receive bilateral C3 through C5 injections of 6x106 cells (20 injections x 3x105 cells/ injection)|Group D: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to receive bilateral C3 through C5 injections of 8x106 cells (20 injections x 4x105 cells/ injection)|Group E: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to receive bilateral L2 through L5 injections of 8x106 cells (20 injections of 4x105 cells/ injection) and then approximately 4-12 weeks later to receive bilateral C3 through C5 injections of 8x106 cells (20 injections of 4x105 cells/ injection.||Transition from one group to the next will be determined by review of available safety data by a Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) which will occur approximately one month post surgery of the last subject in the group. The study data will be collected for 6 months post stem cell transplantation of each study subject. However, all subjects will be followed clinically until death and all SAEs and post-study data will be collected and reported. Autopsy will be strongly encouraged for evaluation of pathology and presence of transplanted cells.||The treatment consists of laminectomy or laminoplasty of approximately two to three vertebral segments overlying either L2 through L4 (for Group E only) or C3 through C5 cord segments (for all Groups) in order to allow intraspinal injections of HSSC. Each injection will administer approximately 2, 3, or 4 x 105 cells in approximately 8.5 - 10 µL volume. The subjects will receive 5 or 10 injections at approximately 4 to 5mm intervals on each side of the cord, in total 10 or 20 injections. Each injection is completed in approximately 3 minutes. The total surgical time is expected to be approximately 3 to 5 hours. After the surgery, subjects will receive routine standard of care for laminectomy subjects who undergo an intradural procedure. Prior to and after the transplant, subjects will be required to remain on immunosuppressive therapy. Immunosuppressive therapy will consist of: 1) basiliximab (Simulect®) 20mg intravenously (IV) when the dura is opened, then again at day 4 post transplantation; 2) tacrolimus (Prograf®) initially dosed at a maximum of 0.1 mg/kg divided approximately every 12 hours by mouth (po) on post transplant day 1, and then maintained at a dose that provides a trough serum level of 4 to 8 ng/ml (adjusted for IV use as necessary); and 3) mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept®) started on post transplant day 1 at 500 mg approximately every 12 hours and progressively increased over 2 weeks to 1.0 gram by mouth (po) twice a day as tolerated. Dose escalation may be modified at the discretion of the site Principal Investigator (PI). Subjects will also receive an initial bolus dose of methylprednisolone 125 mg IV approximately 2 hours prior to the first injection. Beginning on post-operative day 1, the subject will receive oral prednisone 60 mg po daily (QD) for 7 days postoperatively, then progressively decreased over the next 21 days as follows: 40 mg/day for 7 days, 20 mg/day for 7 days, then 10 mg/day for 7 days. At 28 days, prednisone will be discontinued. All pre- and post-surgery immunosuppressive drugs will be administered as noted above, at the discretion of the site PI. If these subjects have previously discontinued mycophenolate mofetil and/or tacrolimus, they may be re-challenged as per the dosing described above, at the discretion of the site PI.||The decision to continue immunosuppression therapy will be at the discretion of the site PIs. Mycophenolate mofetil may be dosed down to half or discontinued prior to the end of the study period if the subject experiences adverse reactions to the immunosuppressive agents. If adverse reactions still persist, tacrolimus dose can be further reduced in half and then further considered to be discontinued. Any or all of the immunosuppressive agents may be reduced or stopped at the discretion of the site PI if it is suspected or determined that the immunosuppressive agent is the cause of toxicity and if symptoms of toxicity cannot be managed adequately with symptomatic treatment.||The study will proceed successively from Group A to Group E with a 4-week interval between Groups. The Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) will be convened at the end of the 4-week interval and review all available safety data. Based on the safety outcomes from the 3 subjects in each Group, the SMB will recommend, according to a predetermined rule, whether to enroll 3 new subjects into the next Group, to continue to collect additional information from the same Group, to enroll additional subjects into the same Group, or to suspend the study. Potential subjects will be recruited for the study but put on a waiting list until SMB approval of their treatment. The SMB will consist of 3 neurologists with expertise in ALS, 1 spinal neurosurgeon, 1 neurooncologist, 1 transplant immunologist, and the scientific director of the ALS Association.||Subjects will be assessed for adverse events including pain and infection, motor function, and quality of life. Additional assessments will be made to measure any postoperative changes from baseline in neurologic deficits, imaging studies, bladder or bowel function, allodynia, and neuropathic pain (see schedule of activities). Subjects will also undergo serial assessments of respiratory function (vital capacity (VC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF)), motor function (Ashworth Spasticity Scale, hand-held dynamometry and electrical impedance myography (EIM)), and respiratory function (diaphragm ultrasound). All subjects will undergo cardiac autonomic function testing at Day -14 to Day -2 pre-operatively, and at 1 and 3 months post-operatively to monitor for potential cardiac autonomic neuropathy.||There will be a lead-in period of at least 1 month period of clinical evaluations before surgery to estimate the slope of decline of clinical status. Measures during this lead-in time will be the ALSFRS-R, hand-held dynamometry/grip strength, Ashworth Spasticity Scale, VC and NIF, EIM, and diaphragm ultrasound.Subjects will be followed postoperatively at 2 and 4 weeks, and then at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months, and then at every 6 months thereafter until death.",ALS
NCT03085706,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly evolving, fatal neurodegenerative disease resulting from the degeneration of cortical, bulbar and spinal motor neurons. The disease progresses inexorably to death, usually because by failure of respiratory function, with a median duration of 3 years.||Recent clinical trials using various types of stem cells, including mesenchymal stromal cells, neural stem cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), represent promising strategies for stem cell-based treatment in ALS. It has been demonstrated that the inflammation and neuronal death were reduced in ALS patients after bone marrow transplantation. In addition, the incidence of immune response was decreased by autologous transplantation of bone marrow cells in ALS patients. PBMCs are multi-potent stem cells that are very attractive for a cell therapy approach in ALS because of their plasticity and ability to provide the host tissue with growth factors or modulate the host immune system. PBMCs were used clinically and few adverse effects were attributed to their administration. Early clinical investigations indicated that the transplantation of autologous PBMCs into the dura is feasible in ALS patients; however, one study was limited to three patients and the other recruited eight patients. There are still many questions regarding the intrathecal transplantation of PBMCs for ALS. Therefore, a retrospective study was performed to assess further the safety and efficacy of the procedure and to test the impact of a cell therapy approach in ALS patients.||Statistical analysis Data, expressed as the mean ± SD, were analyzed using SPSS version 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

There are currently no effective disease modifying therapies for ALS and death usually occurs within 3 years of symptom onset. Management is palliative and is aimed at maximising quality of life and minimising the burden of disease. The complexity and rapidly progressive nature of ALS requires a responsive multidisciplinary care system that that is built on reliable disease staging and evidence based symptom management.||Aim:||To incorporate detailed clinical information drawn from population based sources into a responsive care programme.||Plan of investigation:||A standardised staging system will be validated, and quality of life and patient experiences will be measured and management optimised across disease stages from diagnosis to end of life. Health economic analysis will identify key differences in resource utilisation and will be useful for pharmaco-economic analyses of new therapeutics.||Potential impact:||The completed project will provide a user-friendly best practice framework for ALS that can be modified for management of other neurodegenerative diseases.",ALS

NCT03272503,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease is a neuromuscular disease that results in rapid decline in normal muscle function and tone leading to difficulties with mobility, eating, drinking, breathing, sleeping, and communicating. The disease is progressive and no cure currently exists. Most people diagnosed with ALS succumb within 3 to 5 years. Rilutek® (riluzole) has been approved as a treatment to slow progression of ALS, but is minimally effective with mean increase in survival of only a few months. Radicava® or Radicut® (edaravone) has recently been approved in Canada, USA, Japan and South Korea.||Muscular dysfunction present in people with ALS is caused by nerve breakdown and a dysfunction in the communication between the muscles and the nerves.

Some recent studies have focused on using different medications to enhance communication at the neuromuscular junction with the goal of improving muscle function as a result. This approach is unproven but may help to slow the progression of the disease.||Pimozide is a medication that has been demonstrated to enhance communication at the neuromuscular junction in fish and mice.

NCT00877604,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or motor neuron disease (MND), is a rapidly progressive, fatal neurodegenerative condition characterized by loss of upper and lower motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The terms ALS and MND are often used inter-changeably to cover the different clinical syndromes, which include upper and lower motor neuron disorder, progressive bulbar palsy, and pseudo-polyneuritic form.||Degeneration of lower motor neurons (LMN) in the anterior horns of spinal cord and brainstem leads to progressive muscular atrophy and eventually to death within a few years due to respiratory insufficiency. During the course of the disease, the involvement of tongue and pharynx muscles causes swallowing impairment with marked drooling, need of parenteral or enteral feeding, and finally gastrostomy. Denervation of laryngeal muscles causes loss of speech. Cramps and fasciculation typically occur from the early phases of the disease. Degeneration of upper motor neurons (UMN) in the brain cortex causes pyramidal tract dysfunctions including clonus, Babinski sign, hypertonia, and loss of dexterity that further limit patients' daily activities.||The incidence of ALS varies from 0.2 to 2.5 cases per 100,000 per year, although estimates vary between countries, likely reflecting a combination of availability of medical services, diagnostic accuracy, and demo-graphic characteristics of the area. Increasing life expectancy and improvements in standards of treatment and care will also result in an increased incidence of ALS. Globally, the overall rate is approximately 2 per 100,000. Its prevalence is approximately of 7 per 100,000. In Italy, the reported incidence of ALS is 2.2 cases/100,000/year.||There is currently no cure for ALS. Despite initial positive results in preclinical and early clinical studies, large-scale clinical trials with all agents except riluzole failed to demonstrate a clinically meaningful therapeutic effect in patients with ALS. Riluzole at the dose of 100 mg/day showed a significant difference on survival (6.4%; gain of 3 months) and slowed deterioration in muscle strength.||Primary involvement of apoptotic mechanisms has important implications in selecting drug candidates for therapy in ALS. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated that TUCA is endowed with antioxidant, antiapoptotic and neuroprotective activities. In particular, TUDCA can cross the blood-brain-barrier and has been shown to exert a significant therapeutic effect in a model of HD mice.||Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a hydrophilic bile acid that is normally produced endogenously in humans at very low levels. TUDCA is synthesized in the liver by conjugation of taurine to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which is commonly used as a bile acid replacement therapy for the treatment of certain cholestatic syndromes.||The main pharmacological activity of TUDCA consists in its ability in increasing the cholesterol solubilising activity of bile, thus transforming ""lithogenic"" bile in ""non-lithogenic"" or ""litholytic"" bile.||TUDCA inhibits mitochondrial-associated apoptosis via many pathways: 1) it inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and cytochrome C release, 2) it inhibits mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and 3) it antagonizes Bax translocation from the mitochondria and caspase activation in hepatocytes and brain. TUDCA may also ease oxidative stress.Study relevant TUDCA pharmacology consists in its antioxidant, antiapoptotic and neuroprotective activities evidenced in preclinical studies.||Recent reports have shown that hydrophilic bile acids, such as UDCA and TUDCA, can prevent hepatic cytotoxicity through several mechanisms. For example, TUDCA prevents the production of reactive oxygen species and thus acts as an antioxidant. Additionally, TUDCA mitigates mitochondrial insufficiency and toxicity, and prevents apoptosis, in part, by inhibiting Bax translocation from cytosol to the mitochondria. In hepatocytes, this inhibition results in reduced mitochondrial membrane perturbation, release of cytochrome c, and activation of downstream caspases. TUDCA reduced cytotoxicity in neurons through similar mechanisms, as well as mitochondrial pathways that are independent of the permeability transition. TUDCA prevented striatal degeneration and ameliorated locomotor and cognitive deficits in the in vivo 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) rat model of HD. Intracellular inclusions were significantly reduced, and the TUDCA-treated mice showed improved locomotor and sensorimotor abilities.||In addition, the antiapoptotic and cytoprotective effects of TUDCA have been tested in models of acute stroke. The possibility that TUDCA exerts an antiapoptotic action by ameliorating mitochondrial function raises the issue whether other neurological disorders, including Friedreich's ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, can benefit by the administration of TUDCA. This drug is a candidate neuroprotective agent for a variety of chronic neurodegenerative conditions.",ALS

NCT01823380,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is one of the most serious neurodegenerative disease, leading to death in 3 years by progressive paralysis of 4 limbs, speech, swallowing and breathing, and due to a progressive death of central and peripheral neurons. The cause of the disease is unknown, but an immunologically factor is more precisely suspected in ALS. Since 2008, the work of Immunology have shown that vitamin D was a major regulator of immunity. It regulates particularly the function of dendritic cells and regulates the immune response in macrophages. A vitamin D deficiency will induce activation of microglia. In neurology, vitamin D deficiency is associated with a greater impairment in neuronal function. This deficit is associated with a faster alteration of the microvasculature, alteration known to increase neuronal suffering and to enhance the neurodegenerative processes. The investigators postulate that ALS patients have a more severe prognosis if their vitamin D levels at the time of diagnosis is lower.

NCT00958048,"Objectives: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the commonest motor neuron disease with incidence of 0.8 person-years in Chinese. Respiratory muscle function has been proposed to be a strong predictor of quality of life (QoL) and survival in ALS. Some studies suggest that most patients with ALS developed hypoventilation when their vital capacity (FVC) is less than 50% of predicted value. However, the incidence of hypoventilation and factors associated with hypoventilation in ALS patients is not clear. Also, there is still no consensus as to which physiologic marker should be used as a trigger for the initiation of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in ALS patients. The conflicts of studies come from variable subgroup of ALS, pulmonary function at enrollment, techniques used to diagnose ALS, time to apply NIV, and target endpoint. Therefore, this project aimed to study ALS patients who had relatively preserved respiratory muscle function and no respiratory failure at clinical to achieve three goals: (1) To determine the incidence of hypoventilation in ALS patients (2) To identify the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with hypoventilation in ALS patients (3) To determine the effect of early intervention with NIV on the prognosis of ALS patients Study design: Randomized, controlled trial Participants: ALS patients whose FVC 40%-80% of predict, Pimax <60mmHg, and daytime PaCO2<50mmHg Protocol: Eligible patients with whole-night polysomnography (PSG) and transcutaneous CO2 (PtcCO2). Enrolled patients were randomized to standard treatment or NIV. The primary endpoint of prognosis was survival. The secondary endpoint was changes of PtcCO2 and PaCO2, unexpected admission or clinic visiting, daytime function and QoL.||Statistic: The baseline demographics of patients with or without hypoventilation were compared to determine the factors associated with hypoventilation in ALS patients. The impact of NIV in ALS patients was determined by comparing the primary and secondary goals between standard treatment and NIV group.

NCT02969759,"The investigators will study fibroblasts derived from sporadic ALS patients.||Clinical parameters will be collected such as sex, age, age of onset, clinical presentation, electrophysiological an respiratory parameters, treatments.||Patients and controls derived fibroblasts will be amplified and cultivated from skin biopsies.||Primary fibroblast cell cultures will be derived from skin biopsies obtained from control subjects and from the patients after obtaining written consent. Amplifications will be performed, from passage 1 to 6, allowing the time for cell cryopreservation of 10 samples per cell line. All experiments will be conducted on cells with similar passage numbers, ranging from 6 to 25, to avoid artefacts due to senescence.||Cell growth of each line will be monitored with the IncuCyte ZOOM® system (Essen Biosciences), a microscope gantry that resides in a cell incubator, and a networked external controller hard drive that gathers and processes image data. Cell growth will be automatically calculated at each time point using the relative cell density (ratio of the occupied area to the total area of the acquired regions).||The respiratory parameters of the fibroblasts will be monitored precisely with an high resolution oxygraph (OROBOROS). Enzymatic activity of each complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain will be measured by spectrometry, and the mitochondrial membrane potential will be studied with fluorescence microscopy (TMRM probe). The investigators will also study mitochondrial dynamics and the architecture of mitochondrial network with fluorescence microscopy and super-resolution microscopy (SRM, Roper). The production of free radicals will be estimated with probes sensitive to oxidative stress. Finally, a metabolomic study (mass spectrometry QTRAP LC/MS/MS 5500 ABSciex) will be performed to characterise precisely the metabolites in the cells and to assess their metabolic profile.||The investigators will search for protein inclusions (intermediate filaments, TDP43, FUS, ubiquitin) with immuno-fluorescence technics.

The architecture of the cytoskeleton will be analysed in SRM and fluorescence microscopy, and the investigators will try to transfect fibroblasts in order to express Neurofilaments and study the consequences on the cytoskeleton and protein metabolism.||The investigators will study the response of the cells to the stress (hypoxia SCI-tive Dual, starvation), and to senescence (high passage numbers).",ALS
NCT00790582,"This is a Phase II Screening study. There is no placebo (inactive or 'fake' drug) in this study, meaning that all participants will be taking lithium carbonate. The purpose of this study is to find out if lithium carbonate is safe to be used in people with ALS and if it can slow the progression of the disease.||A recent article was published in a highly regarded medical journal that showed a positive effect of lithium carbonate on an ALS type mouse. The researchers then studied a very small number of people with ALS, giving 16 people lithium carbonate with riluzole and giving 28 people only riluzole. The people who took lithium remained stronger for a considerably longer period of time. However, the study was very small and we cannot really tell if lithium works unless a larger study is performed. It is not well understood why lithium carbonate might be helpful but it is believed that it may play a role in protecting the motor nerves from the damage of ALS.||If you choose to participate, you will need to go to your study clinic for research study visits 7 times in one year and you will have 4 telephone interviews during that time.

NCT02437110,"Objective:||In this Phase I, proof-of-concept study, we aim to determine whether an antiretroviral regimen approved to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection would also suppress levels of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K (HERV-K) found to be activated in a subset of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We propose to measure the of blood levels of HERV-K by quantitative PCR before, during, and after treatment with an antiretroviral regimen. We will evaluate the safety of the antiretroviral regimen for participants with ALS and also explore clinical and neurophysiological outcomes of ALS symptoms, quality of life, and pulmonary function.||Study Population:||We will study a subset of ALS patients who have a ratio of HERV-K:RPP30 greater than or equal to 13. About 30% of ALS patients may have detectable levels of HERV-K; about 20% of patients with ALS have a level >1000 copies/ml. To show whether the HERV-K could be suppressed, we will recruit from the approximately 20% of patients with the high levels so that the antiretroviral effect can be determined.||Design:||This is an open-label study of a combination antiretroviral therapy for 24 weeks in 20 HIV-negative, HTLV-negative ALS patients with high ratio of HERV-K:RPP30. The study duration for each participant will be up to 60 weeks. Participants will be followed regularly for safety, clinical, and neurophysiological outcomes.||Outcome Measures:||The primary outcome measure will be the percent decline HERV-K concentration measured by quantitataive PCR. Percent decline for a patient is measured by: 100 x (screening visit - week 24 visit measurement) / screening visit. The safety of antiretrovirals in volunteers with ALS as measured by the frequency and type of AEs, the ability to remain on assigned treatment (tolerability), physical examinations, laboratory test results, vital signs, and weight/body mass index (BMI).

However, although these devices have become the standard of therapy in ALS patients once their lung function worsens, it remains unclear how effective these devices actually are when a patient is sleeping, partly because of the practical difficulties in applying the device properly and keeping it applied throughout the sleep period, and partly because they are most commonly prescribed without objective evidence regarding how much breathing support the patient needs as the disease progresses and the breathing muscles weaken further.",ALS
NCT03892382,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of central and peripheral motor neurons. ALS leads to death usually within 3 to 5 years from the onset of the symptoms. Available treatment can prolong the disease duration but cannot modify the disease course. Apathy is a frequent complication of ALS, which negatively influences quality of life (caga et al. 2018) and is an independent poor prognostic factor for survival (Caga et al. 2016).

NCT02869048,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, deadly, neurodegenerative disease which affects the upper and lower motor neurons. This leads to profound muscular dystrophy, hyperreflexia, fasciculations and paresis of the bulbar as well as the skeletal musculature. ALS causes increasing physical fatigue and the patients soon become bedridden and respiratory insufficient.The diagnosis ALS is made according to the El Escorial revisited. Often clinical and neurophysiological tests must be repeated (1-4).||In Denmark the incidence of ALS is 1-2/100.000 and the prevalence is 4-6/100.000. The average survival time from the time of the diagnosis is 3 years but with great variance. (5+6)||Today the pathogenesis is still unknown and no treatment can stop the progression of ALS. Treatment with riluzole seems to prolong the median time of survival for 2 or 3 months (7).||Most likely, a future medical treatment requires a better understanding of the pathogenesis as well as the pathophysiology of ALS. This present study aims to do so based on the hypothesis that ALS partially or fully is caused by complement activation.||The complement system is a complex system consisting of proteins in plasma as well as membrane bound proteins which together complement the antibody-based immune system. The complement system is a self-perpetuating cascade system which is activated through different pathways. It works by opsonisation where complement proteins bind to microorganisms to activate and target granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages. The complement system also causes cytolysis of microorganisms via MAC (membrane attack complex) by activation of the mast cells. It also inactivates and eliminates burned out immune complexes as well as performing apoptotic renovation.||A recent pilot study of Neuromyelitis Optica has shown how the complement system play a central part in the pathogenesis of a disease that previously was wrongfully perceived as an early stage of Disseminated Sclerosis. These findings resulted in medical treatment with anticomplement (equlizumab) with promising results (8). It is possible that similar pathogenetic mechanisms could be the molecular basis of ALS.||Different research groups have tried to illuminate how the immune system is involved in the progression of ALS (9-35). Several studies support the hypothesis that the complement system is of crucial importance for the onset and progression of ALS. (9-28)||In several clinical trials with ALS plasma it is concluded that ALS plasma is cytotoxic when incubated with healthy red blood cells or healthy nerve tissue. Some research indicates that the cytotoxicity is caused by the complement system. The results cannot, however, be reproduced consequently in all clinical trials. These trials were conducted decades ago where the methods of detecting complement activity were limited. (9-14)||Several animal trials indicate that ALS starts in the neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) and therefore should be considered a distal axonopathy rather than a central neurological disease, which today is the general perception of ALS. (27-31)||The purpose of the project The aim is to increase the knowledge of the pathophysiology of the disease ALS as this possibly may lead us closer to a targeted medical treatment.||The project group wants to investigate if a previously found, unique cytotoxicity in the ALS plasma can be retrieved (9-14). If this is the case, then the modern methods of today make it possible to detect whether the immune system in general, and in particular the complement system, is causing this cytotoxicity.||The establishment of a national research project about ALS and the complement system by making a research biobank with systematically collected blood and spinal liquid from ALS patients from all over the country will ensure the opportunity to find out if the complement system plays a role in the onset and progression of ALS.||Furthermore a pilot study will be conducted with the purpose to investigate if there is complement activity in the NMJ in patients with ALS as it has been shown in a study of ALS mice. (28)||The hypotheses||ALS is characterized by an abnormal immune response with cytotoxicity and increased complement activity in plasma which is revealed by the following:||Plasma from patients with ALS shows increased haemolytic activity when incubated with red blood cells from healthy subjects.|The complement activity is increased in the plasma from ALS patients compared with plasma from neurologically healthy subjects and subjects with other neurological disease.|The haemolytic activity in the plasma from ALS patients is correlated with the complement activity.|Spinal liquid from ALS patients contains increased complement activity compared with spinal liquid from neurologically healthy subjects and from subjects with other neurological disease.||Patients, materials and methods:||Clinical trial 1(CT1): Haemolytic activity and the complement system in ALS plasma||Number of subjects: 25 patients with ALS, 25 patients with other neurological disease, 25 healthy volunteers||The course of CT1: A blood sample is taken from each patient. The red blood cells and the liquid part of the blood, the plasma, are separated. The red blood cells from different subjects are incubated in an other subjects plasma.The same trial course is repeated after inactivation of the present complement system both by heat and by anti-complement.||Clinical trial 2(CT2): Case-control study aiming to mapping the complement system||Number of subjects:100 patients with ALS, 100 patients with other neurological disease and 100 neurologically healthy patients||The course of CT2:Blood samples and cerebrospinal fluid are prepared and then freezed in a research biobank. Then the samples from the 3 groups of subjects are analysed and compared focusing on the complement system: The complement activation potential is measured in the biological material. A cytokine profile is made as well as mapping the acute phase reactants by multiplex assays. Furthermore the RNA expression profile is made on a cell pellet stabilised with RNA later.||Clinical trial 3(CT3): The complement system of ALS patients over time - a cohort study Number of subjects:20 patients with ALS (subset from CT2)||The course of CT3: Every sixth month the course from the CT2 is repeated. The activity of the complement system in each patient with ALS is analyzed as the disease progresses.||Clinical trial 4(CT4): Searching for complement activity in the NMJ of ALS patients||Number of subjects:10 patients with ALS||The course of CT4: The muscle biopsies are taken and immediately brought to the Dep. of Pathology at Rigshospitalet.

In order to calculate the odds for low complement activation potential in the ALS group compared with the control groups the investigators use logistic regression. For calculating the cut-off values receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are used.||CT3: The complement system of ALS patients over time - a cohort study As in Clinical Trial 2. Furthermore, regression analysis of the complement activity as a function of time since the onset of ALS, gender, age, subtype of illness and disease progression are conducted.||CT4: Searching for complement activity in the NMJ of ALS patients As in CT2. The degree of complement deposition and muscle pathology is described qualitatively and a blinded scoring in ""normal"", ""light degree"" and ""severe degree"" of changes is conducted.

NCT03693781,"Recent evidence supports the disruption of the ubiquitin-proteasome-system and autophagy as central events in ALS. ALS is characterized by the presence of misfolded proteins prone to oligomerize into aggregates, which exert a toxic effect by affecting several intracellular functions. Heat shock protein B8 (HSPB8) recognizes and promotes the autophagy-mediated removal of misfolded mutant SOD1 and TDP-43 fragments from ALS motor neurons (MNs). Moreover, HSPB8-BAG3-HSP70 maintains the so called ""granulostasis"", a surveillance mechanism that avoids the conversion of dynamic stress granules (SGs) into aggregation-prone assemblies, which are a hallmark of ALS.||Colchicine enhances the expression of HSPB8 and of several autophagy players while blocking TDP-43 accumulation in neurons. Moreover, given the cross-talk between infalmmation and autophagy, the well-known antinflammatory action of Cochicine may contribute to cell homeostasis.||Based on these premises, this is a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter (9 MND Centres in Italy: 2 centres in Milan, Pavia, Turin, Modena, Padua, Rome, Naples, Bari), clinical trial to test efficacy of Colchicine in ALS.",ALS

NCT00420719,"The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the NeuRX RA/4 Diaphragm Pacing Stimulation (DPS) System in conditioning the diaphragm of an ALS patient to improve the quality of life and slow the progression to respiratory failure.||Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease or Motor Neuron Disease) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of unknown cause. One of the most important effects of progressive neuromuscular weakness in patients with ALS is the effect on respiration. Although ALS has no direct effect on the lung, it has devastating effects on mechanical function of the respiratory system. ALS affects all of the major respiratory muscle groups: upper airway muscles, expiratory muscles, and inspiratory muscles. Therefore, all patients with ALS are at significant risk for respiratory complications. Progressive inspiratory muscle weakness in ALS inevitably leads to carbon dioxide retention, inability to clear secretions and hypercarbic respiratory failure, the major cause of death in ALS.||Synapse Biomedical, in conjunction with Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland, have evaluated activating the diaphragm with percutaneous intramuscular electrodes implanted laparoscopically. This eliminates any direct contact with the phrenic nerve, allows all circuitry and electronics to remain outside the body, and provides direct, selective activation to each hemidiaphragm. The NeuRx-RA/4 DPS System provides an electrical signal to the motor point of the muscle that causes the diaphragm to contract and allows patients to breathe more naturally.||The NeuRx RA/4 DPS System has been implanted in over 10 individuals with ALS, in a pilot study at the University Hospitals of Cleveland that began January, 2005.||The NeuRx RA/4 DPS System platform, also used for respiratory support for individuals with high-level spinal cord injury, has over 56 years of cumulative active implantation time.

As a functional assessment tool, the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS - R) was used, validated in Brazilian individuals with ALS which allows monitoring of symptoms and limitations of daily living activities. To evaluate fatigue during the execution of tasks, were used the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and for the assessment of quality of life, were used the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaire in the Portuguese Language (ALSAQ-40/BR), which is also validated for the Brazilian population with ALS.||Protocol Subjects were randomly divided into three groups, using different interfaces for the acquisition of movement. The description of the task and the RV interfaces that were used are described as follows.||Task Participants performed a task to test communication devices developed by the Information Systems Team at the University of São Paulo. The task was set up as a game in which the goal was to reach as many bubbles displayed on an 11-inch computer monitor, forming seven rows and 18 columns with a total of 126 bubbles. This required individuals to be able to use a range as is typically required in communication systems. The task was divided into two phases: (1) the first phase was characterized by identification of dexterity zone or range of reach, in which the subject had to touch (""burst"") the largest possible number of bubbles (changing bubble color from blue to gray) in a set time of 30 seconds, identifying the range zone; (2) the second phase was characterized as the persecution stage, at this time the researcher defined a central bubble (usually chosen in the center of the skill area, on the bottom line), which changed the color to red. From this moment the individual pursued random bubbles that appeared in their range zone, alternating with a return to the central bubble. This phase was carried out for 30 seconds. To motivate, the task randomly provided bubbles outside the range zone and generated a greater challenge to the individual. The software generated information of the coordinates x, y (row and column) where the bubble was touched and the time the bubble was touched. During task execution, the participant received feedback of the number of bubbles touched, the remaining playing time and the total number of points obtained in attempts, thus observing the performance of the participants.||Interfaces To perform the task were used 3 different interfaces: two interfaces without physical contact, being the Kinect® for Windows from Microsoft, composed of a traditional RGB camera and an infrared depth sensor (IR) and LMC®, characterized as a small motion sensor that demonstrated robustness to measure the movements of the hand and fingers. The interface with physical contact, the touchscreen, was the computer screen itself, where individuals touched the screen in order to burst the bubbles, performing the task. It is noteworthy that the touchscreen is a sensitive interface, employed through pressure, created in order to interact with digital information, found in a majority of modern consumer electronics, mainly computers, tablets and mobile phones.||Procedures and design Individuals who participated in the study gave written informed consent and then were sent to a reserved and quiet room to perform the tasks only in the presence of the researcher. The computer monitor was positioned on a table in front of the participants. The chair was adjusted in accordance with the size and need of the individual, with a footrest available if needed. For wheelchair users, their own wheelchair was used. After the necessary adjustments to perform the task, questionnaires and functional assessment scales were applied; then the researcher provided verbal instructions and performed a demonstration of interfaces according to each task (Kinect® for Windows, LMC® or touchscreen). Subjects were instructed to use the dominant hand (i.e., the least affected side) for all interfaces used during the game.||For the acquisition phase a target was set of 300 bubbles to be touched in the definition phase of the dexterity zone. There were 126 bubbles presented during each attempt; therefore it took at least three attempts to reach the proposed goal. Soon after the step establishing the dexterity zone, the researcher defined the central bubble and began the stage of chase area. In addition to the acquisition phase, all groups performed a retention test after 5 minutes with the completion of only one attempt. After the retention test, two transfer tests with the change of interfaces were performed.",ALS

NCT03579017,"Screening of cognitive and behavioral impairment is a distinct recommendation in ALS-specific health-care. Thus, a rapid screening tool valid for use in Norway is urgent. However, cognitive assessment for patients with ALS can be difficult due to the complexity of cognitive impairment, as well as motor challenges with writing, drawing and speaking. Therefore, only ALS-specific, multi domain screening instruments with integrated behavioral sections should be used. Internationally, the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral amyotrophic lateral sclerosis screen (ECAS), is recommended for the purpose. Besides being quick and easy to administer, the ECAS is shown to be sensitive and have high specificity to ALS-specific dysfunction and behavioral changes. The introduction of ECAS has probably contributed to a more nuanced picture of cognitive impairment in ALS than previously assumed. Therefore the ECAS has been translated and culturally adapted into Norwegian (ECAS-N). Based on scores from healthy people, Norwegian age- and educational-adjusted norms for verbal fluency (n=277) and cut-off-scores (n=85) for abnormal findings are established. However, further investigation of psychometric properties of the ECAS-N is needed. The objectives of the study are: 1. To investigate if the ECAS-N reflect cognitive impairment (internal consistency), and is robust to measurement errors due to different times of testing (test-retest reliability) and different raters (interrater reliability) 2.

Patients diagnosed as early stage of ALS with the duration of disease less than 6 months and patients diagnosed with advanced stage of ALS disease with duration of 6-12 months will be recruited and allocated based on their disease severity to two treatment groups: Group I - patients of early ALS disease stage and Group II - patients of advanced ALS disease. Next, autologous bone marrow-isolated stem/progenitor cells administration to the cerebrospinal fluid at the site of the spinal cord will be performed. Finally, treatment safety, adverse events and exploratory parameters, including electromyographic (EMG) studies, forced vital capacity (FVC), functional rating scale (FRS) and maximum voluntary isometric contraction-arm (MVIC-arm) evaluation, to establish ALS progression rate will be recorded throughout the duration of the post-treatment follow up period.",ALS
NCT04055623,"Based on data collected in a previous study with a small group of patients, evidence was found to show that interfering with the immune system using Treg cells slowed ALS disease progression. It is known that Treg cell numbers and function are reduced in patients with ALS and in some patients with lower Treg cells, they have a more marked rapid progression of their ALS. For this study, there are two sites (in Houston, TX and Boston, MA) in which Tregs will be taken from participants, increased or expanded outside the body, and then re-administered back to the participants from which the Tregs came.||This study has two parts:||the first period is a 6-month phase 2a, 2-center, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial studying the biological activity, safety, and tolerability of the increased / expanded Tregs administered intravenously (IV) with subcutaneous low-dose Interleukin-2 (IL-2) in 12 adults with ALS. IL2 helps regulate the immune system's white blood cells.|The second period is a 6-month open-label extension in which all participants will receive their own expanded Treg cells administered intravenously in combination with subcutaneous low-dose IL-2.||This study is studying whether the enhancement of Treg numbers and function will slow disease progression.||In the first study of Tregs, we completed a single-center, open-label phase I study of Tregs from people with ALS. Tregs were increased outside the body and returned back to the individual Treg owners in multiple doses every 2 to 4 weeks. This early study provided evidence in a small group of patients that treatment with autologous Tregs may be effective in slowing ALS progression.",ALS

NCT04233099,"SAMPLE COLLECTION: Saliva collection from all the selected subjects will be performed following the Salivette (SARSTEDT) manufacturer's instructions. To limit variability in salivary content not related to ALS, saliva will be obtained from all subjects at a fixed time, after an appropriate lag time from feeding and teeth brushing. Pre-analytical parameters (i.e. storage temperature and time between collection and processing), dietary and smoking habit will be properly recorded. Briefly, the swab will be removed, placed in the mouth and chewed for 60 seconds to stimulate salivation. Then the swab will be centrifuged for 2 minutes at 1,000 g to remove cells fragments and food debris. Collected samples will be stored at -80° C.||SAMPLE PROCESSING: Before the Raman acquisition, saliva samples will be filtered with different cut-off ranges (3, 10 and 30 kDa), collecting and analysing by RS the eluted sample and discarding the concentrated counterpart. For the Raman analysis, a drop of each sample will be casted on an aluminium foil in order to achieve the Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS).||DATA COLLECTION: Raman and SERS spectra will be acquired using an Aramis Raman microscope (Horiba Jobin-Yvon, France) equipped with a laser light source operating at 785 nm with laser power ranging from 25-100% (Max power 512 mW). Acquisition time between 10-30 seconds will be used. The instrument will be calibrated before each analysis using the reference band of silicon at 520.7 cm-1. Raman spectra will be collected from 15 points following a line-map from the edge to the centre of the drop. Spectra will be acquired in the region between 400 and 1800 cm-1 using a 50x objective (Olympus, Japan). Spectra resolution is about 1.2 cm-1. The software package LabSpec 6 (Horiba Jobin-Yvon, France) will be used for map design and the acquisition of spectra.||DATA PROCESSING: All the acquired spectra will be fit with a fifth-degree polynomial baseline and normalized by unit vector using the dedicated software LabSpec 6. The contribution of the substrate will be removed from each spectra. The statistical analysis to validate the method, will be performed using a multivariate analysis approach. Principal Component analysis (PCA) will be performed in order to reduce data dimensions and to evidence major trends. The first 20 resultant Principal Components (PCs) will be used in a classification model, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), to discriminate the data maximizing the variance between the selected groups. The smallest number of PCs will be selected to prevent data overfitting. Leave-one-out cross-validation and confusion matrix test will be used to evaluate the method sensitivity, precision and accuracy of the LDA model.

NCT03573466,"The neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where the axon terminal connects the motor endplate of the muscle fiber, is the first structure affected in various Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) rodent models. In these models, NMJ denervation and initial compensatory reinnervation are the earliest pathological event. These NMJ morphological defects occur far before changes can be seen at the level of motor neuron cell bodies and motor symptom onset. In these rodent models, there is thus a ""latency phase"" of the disease.||In ALS patients, the onset of symptoms is believed to occur when approximately 50 to 80% of motor neurons are lost and it has been suggested that the disease may have a prolonged preclinical period. After clinical onset of the disease, the existence of striking NMJ morphological defects and compensatory reinnervation of endplates has been shown in muscle of ALS patients, but their occurrence at the presymptomatic stage has never been investigated. As in animal models, at the subclinical onset of the disease, efficient reinnervation of NMJs could compensate for the loss of motor neurons and subjects would remain free of any motor symptom. As the destruction of NMJs progresses, compensation would become ineffective, leading to progressive muscle weakness and clinical onset of the disease. Identification of early, pre-symptomatic, NMJ pathological events and compensatory mechanisms could thus lead to the development of new treatment strategies to prevent motor functional impairment.||In human, the ""latency phase"" of the disease can be investigated in pre-manifest ALS mutation carriers. Indeed, in a population of asymptomatic carriers of C9ORF72 or SOD1 mutations (two of the main genes associated with familial ALS), a dysregulation of circulating microRNAs has been found long before the estimated time window of disease symptom onset.||The objectives of the PRE-ALS study are:||Primary objective: to investigate and characterize early, preclinical defects of NMJ morphology in muscle specimens from pre-manifest C9ORF72 or SOD1 mutation carriers;||Secondary objectives:||to investigate and quantify reinnervation at the level of NMJs in these subjects; and|to identify muscle dysregulated pathways involved in the development of NMJ alterations and the development / maintenance of compensatory collateral reinnervation.||For this purpose, ten subjects with mutations in one of two major ALS-associated genes - C9ORF72 and SOD1- free from any motor symptom, will be included in the study. These subjects, diagnosed on the basis of presymptomatic DNA tests performed in the context of familial ALS or familial frontotemporal dementia linked to C9ORF72 expansion (C9-FTD), will be recruited from the Paris ALS center (Dr Salachas) and the Reference Centre for Rare Dementias (Dr Le Ber). Subjects harboring mutations in the C9ORF72 gene with only moderate cognitive impairment may also be included if they are free of motor involvement after neurological examination.||Subjects will be clinically and neurophysiologically followed-up during 18 months after inclusion in the study:||Muscle strength will be measured by manual muscle testing according to the grading system of the Medical Research Council;|Functional motor impairment will be assessed using the widely used revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), a 12-item scale that rates the performance of activities of daily living;|Motor neuron loss will be evaluated using Motor Unit Number Index (MUNIX), a validated method to assess number and size of motor units in ALS patients.||A muscle biopsy will be performed to investigate potential morphological defects at the level of NMJs. The morphology of NMJs will be analyzed using confocal microscopy after immunostaining and collateral reinnervation will be quantified for each subject. Dysregulated intracellular signaling pathways potentially implicated in preclinical structural defects of NMJs and / or reinnervation will be investigated in parallel.||To date, the PRE-ALS study will be the first to investigate preclinical changes of NMJs in presymptomatic ALS mutation carriers and to identify muscle compensatory mechanisms allowing preservation of motor function.

Following informed consent and enrollment, subjects were given a complete physical and neurological examination including the validated Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). Swallowing safety was assessed using the gold standard Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) to allow direct visualization of the swallowing process and any episodes of penetration or aspiration were quantified using the validated Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS). Subjects participated in a standardized protocol that includes 11 bolus stimuli presentations of different liquid and food materials to test swallowing function using a progression of textures and materials.

NCT01884571,"In an ongoing safety trial of neural stem cell injections into the spinal cord of patients with ALS at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, one patient has demonstrated clear improvement by objective clinical and electrophysiological measures, a finding that is unheard of in patients with ALS.||This patient had an improvement in ALSFRS-R by 1.4 points per month. In 826 historical controls from the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) and the Western ALS Consortium (WALS) database where ALSFRS-R was documented at 2 or more visits, there have been no patients that have shown improvement in ALSFRS as seen in this case. Additionally, 5 patients in the stem cell trial who were not on mechanical ventilators at the time of surgery seem to have very slow disease progression as compared to the expectation from current understanding of typical disease course. This observation raises consideration for a disease-modifying effect of the novel immunosuppression regimen used in this trial. Also, given that ALS is clinically an extraordinarily heterogeneous disease, the diagnosis of ALS may represent a group of phenotypically similar but pathogenically variable disorders. It is possible that there exists a subset of patients with an immune-responsive ALS subtype that has not been previously recognized.||Recent studies have furthered the understanding of the immune mechanisms that contribute to ALS progression. Microglia and lymphocytes have both neurotoxic and neuroprotective functions depending on activation states and physiologic conditions within the nervous system. Therefore, targeted immunotherapies that proportionally suppress neurotoxic immune elements, while sparing or promoting protective elements, seemingly have more potential to modify disease course in ALS than previously tested regimens. It is postulated that the immunosuppression treatment given to the stem cell patients may have exhibited neuroprotective effects by favorably promoting the ratio of regulatory T cells and other protective immune mediators in relation to neurotoxic immune modulators. It is hoped that this trial will optimize the chance of replicating these findings and advance knowledge about the complex changes that occur within the immune system in patients with ALS before and after treatment with an immunosuppression regimen.||The primary outcome measure will be rate of change of ALSFRS-R. A clinical response will be defined as a rate of change of ALSFRS-R of +6 points over a 6 month period (mean of change of +1 point per month).||Secondary outcome measures will include slow vital capacity (SVC), grip strength, and hand held dynamometry (HHD).

NCT03560661,"ALS is a motor neuron disease characterized by a progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. Degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons (UMN and LMN) leads to spasticity, impaired reflexes, muscle fatigue, muscle weakness and atrophy. PLS is a motor neuron disease involving exclusively the UMN system and Kennedy's disease is a genetic condition involving the LMN system. Those three different motor neuron diseases can lead to a dysarthria. Affected individuals with ALS vary significantly in the locus of disease onset, presentation at diagnosis and rate of progression. Regardless of the site of onset, most patients with ALS will experience bulbar motor deterioration that will lead to a dysarthria. According to Darley's classification of dysarthrias, dysarthria in ALS is grossly described as ""mixed"" (both spastic, due the UMN deterioration, and flaccid, due to the LMN deterioration). However, at the onset of bulbar signs, when the dysarthria is still mild, dysarthric profiles and bulbar clinical signs can vary within individuals. Perceptual and acoustic features of dysarthria in ALS have been studied but they have not been studied in dysarthric patients with PLS and KD. This study was motivated by the need to better understand the dysarthria in ALS and it's management in speech therapy. The goals of this study is to question the impact of the degeneration of the UMN system versus the LMN system on the speech motor system and see if the investigators can identify acoustic and perceptual markers related to UMN degeneration on one side and LMN degeneration on the other side. The investigators will compare acoustic and perceptual features between the recorded speech of different clinical groups. Clinical groups will be made according to clinical signs and EMG. The clinical signs for UMN involvement in the bulbar region are: gag reflex, jaw clonus, pseudobulbar features (lability). The clinical signs for LMN involvement are: lingual atrophy and fasciculation.

NCT01609283,"The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of intrathecal delivery of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with ALS using a dose-escalation study. The trial will include 25 adult, non-ventilator-dependent patients with clinically definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Cells will be isolated from adipose tissue, expanded ex vivo and then, after ~8 weeks, intrathecal (IT) autologous delivery of MSCs will be performed. There will be 5 treatment groups of up to 5 patients each. Groups 1, 2, and 4 will receive a single dose of cells. Groups 3 and 5 will receive 2 doses of cells separated by 1 month. Groups will be completed sequentially so that patients will not be enrolled into the next treatment group until at least 3 patients in the preceding group have completed the treatment and 1 month of additional observation without significant toxicity. All patients will be followed on a regular basis until death or for a minimum of 2 years after completion of the final infusion. Initial clinical follow-up will be weekly with scheduled blood, CSF and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations.

NCT03168711,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Multiple lines of evidence have implicated oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of ALS. Urate (uric acid) is an endogenous antioxidant system, and urate may serve as a major defense against oxidative stress. Urate has emerged as a promising neuro-protectant and therapeutic target based on convergent epidemiological, laboratory, and clinical data in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD, urate elevation has been pursued as a potential therapy by administration of inosine, a urate precursor that is available as an over-the-counter supplement. Administration of inosine results in a predictable elevation of urate levels and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in PD.||Analysis of ALS databases revealed that higher urate levels are an independent predictor of slower progression and prolonged survival in ALS. However, whether elevating urate in people with ALS would result in better outcomes is unknown.||The Principal Investigator has recently concluded a Pilot Study of Inosine in ALS, which was a short, open label, single center study involving 25 subjects [NCT02288091]. The study showed safety and feasibility of urate elevation in patients with ALS.

NCT02152449,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease with a median age at time of diagnosis of 65 years. In France, the incidence ranges between 1.5 and 2.5/100 000 person-year of follow-up. The disease is related to progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the two voluntary motor pathways. It is a very debilitating disease, particularly in terms of autonomy and respiratory function. Its prognosis is poor, with constant worsening during the follow-up, leading to death with a median survival of 24 months after diagnosis. ALS patients are at risk of malnutrition in the short and medium term, because of several factors limiting or stopping food intake, such as functional disability, and swallowing or breathing disorders. The disease is also accompanied in 50-60% of cases by an abnormal increase in energy expenditure (hypermetabolism), causing added weight loss. Previous studies have shown that malnutrition is an independent negative prognostic factor for survival. Besides, at time of diagnosis, 36% of patients have already lost more than 5% of their usual weight. Such a weight loss has been shown to be associated with a 2 fold increased risk of dying, after adjustment for other known prognostic factors. Moreover, patients with a higher fat body mass during the course of the disease have a significant increased survival; and higher levels of serum cholesterol and/or triglycerides are favourable factors for survival. The recommendations for the management of ALS patients, published by French and International groups of experts, have suggested the use of oral nutritional supplementation if food intake does not cover the patient's requirements.||We propose that Oral Nutritional Supplementation (ONS) should be used (i) systematically and (ii) earlier (as early as the time of diagnosis) in order to enable patients to maintain proper nutritional status.||Such an intervention could delay the progression of the disease if the metabolic disorders in ALS are not solely the result of progression of the disease, but are implicated in its course and outcome.||This is a parallel randomized study aimed To assess the benefits of early oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) on neurological functional status evaluated by the slope of the revised ALS Functional rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) between inclusion (T0) and T0+6 months in newly diagnosed ALS pati",ALS
NCT01849770,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily motor neurons, for which treatment designed to slow or arrest progression remains lacking. Mexiletine is a use-dependent sodium channel blocker that has been FDA-approved for decades for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and more recently to treat neuropathic pain in diabetic polyneuropathy. Mexiletine has been shown also to be protective of neurons following spinal cord, head injury, and cerebral ischemia, largely by blocking excitotoxicity. Based on previous studies, mexiletine appears to penetrate into the central nervous system at concentrations sufficient to confer significant protection. Recent unpublished studies in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Brown at the University of Massachusetts have also demonstrated that mexiletine ingestion in mice genetically engineered to express high levels of mutant cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) transgene prolongs survival in these animals. As mexiletine already has FDA-approval as an anti-arrhythmic agent, much is known about the pharmacology and safety of this drug in non-ALS patients. We anticipate that by excluding subjects with a known history of cardiac disease and with the known neuroprotectant properties of this medication, mexiletine is a good choice for further study in an ALS clinical trial.",ALS
NCT00007722,"Primary Objectives: To develop, through nationwide ascertainment, a comprehensive descriptive epidemiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) among Gulf War veterans with particular attention to whether there is a higher than expected occurrence of ALS among deployed veterans as compared to non-deployed Gulf War veterans.||Secondary Objectives: To ascertain probable/possible etiologic factors with particular focus on the role of chemical or biologic factors in the Persian Gulf area of deployment.||Primary Outcomes: Incidence of ALS among deployed and non-deployed veterans of the Gulf War.||Intervention: N/A||Study Abstract: Recently, concern has arisen regarding a possible elevated occurrence of ALS among veterans who served in the Persian Gulf during Operations Desert Shield (August 2, 1990 - January 15, 1991), Desert Storm (January 16, 1991 - February 28, 1991) and Clean-up (March 1, 1991 - July 31, 1991). In response to this concern, a nationwide epidemiological investigation was conducted to ascertain all occurrences of ALS between August, 1990 and July, 2000 among all active duty military and mobilized Reserves, including National Guard, who served during the Gulf War period (August 2, 1990-July 31, 1991). A diagnosis of ALS was confirmed by medical record review and, as necessary, neurological examination. Risk was assessed by the age-adjusted, average, annual 10-year cumulative incidence rate. VA led this joint federal government epidemiologic study that also involved DoD, HHS, CDC, and academic centers of excellence in neurology, with advice from the ALS Association.||The study population was defined as all active duty military and mobilized reserves and National Guard who served for at least one month at any time during the Gulf War period. Mobilized reservists and members of the National Guard were those who were activated and called-up, being either deployed to S.W. Asia or ""back-filling"" positions of military personnel who were deployed. Deployed military personnel were those who served in the S.W. Asian theater during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm or the period immediately after Desert Storm or received hazardous duty pay during the Gulf War. All other individuals in the study population were classified as non-deployed, although they may have been stationed outside the U.S.||This study has as its primary component a field epidemiological investigation, involving nationwide ascertainment of ALS cases among deployed and non-deployed veterans of the Gulf War to obtain a census of ALS cases among these populations. Ascertainment of cases occurred through three avenues. The first was a search of extant VA and DoD medical databases. Second, we solicited cases from the ALS Association, other related organizations, and from VA and DoD neurology clinics. And third, we identified cases through self-referrals that resulted from national media announcements. Purported cases were verified via medical record review and, as necessary, a detailed clinical examination. For all living cases, we are collecting a sample of blood and urine for determination of ALS-relevant DNA mutations and heavy metal exposure, respectively. There is also an in-home visit that includes an interview of the patient and family members with emphasis on ascertainment of unique exposures.||Results: In this large epidemiological study, researchers supported by both the Department of VA and DoD have found preliminary evidence that veterans who served in Desert Shield-Desert Storm are nearly twice as likely as their non-deployed counterparts to develop ALS. VA is exploring options for compensating veterans who served in the Gulf and who subsequently develop ALS.||Ongoing Surveillance: The study team has implemented an ongoing surveillance system to detect future cases of ALS that develop in this veteran population. This system involves maintaining the linkages created to detect current cases. New cases will be subject to the same protocols for verification, enrollment and data collection as in the original case ascertainment study.",ALS

The biomarkers identified will serve as potential tools for the evaluation of efficacy in future therapeutic studies in ALS4. The protocol will primarily seek to enroll patients with mutation in the SETX gene and follow these individuals annually for 3 years. Individuals with mutation in genes that are predicted to result in a similar disruption of RNA processing (such as ribonuclease H1 and H2 (RNASEH1+2) genes and recessive mutations in SETX will serve as disease controls and participate in follow-up for 3 years to collect clinical and molecular biomarkers.

NCT00716131,"Despite significant progress in the identification of mechanisms involved in motor neuron degeneration in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other motor system diseases, the actual pathogenesis and cause of these diseases remains unknown. Effective treatment of these diseases are dependent on the elucidation of their causes. The availability of diseased and control human tissues will be a critical resource for this research progress. . Samples of serum, spinal fluid, and urine from patients with motor system diseases can be used to study biochemical and genetic differences compared to tissues of neurologic disease controls and normal controls. Furthermore, the availability of autopsied CNS, PNS, as well as other tissues from patients with ALS or suspected ALS are useful for current and future research studies into the disease. Therefore, we propose to institute a Tissue Bank containing blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid donated from not only ALS and other motor neuron disease patients, but also those with other neurologic diseases and normals whose tissue can be used as controls. In addition there will be an autopsy band for post-mortem specimens of ALS and other motor neuron disease patients. Each specimen, whether from a living patient or autopsy will be de-identified and accompanied by a standard set of clinical information collected from the medical records in order that each specimen is characterized with the relevant clinical information to maximize the usefulness of the specimens.||Once established, this tissue bank will provide a resource in which a large number of samples will be readily available and expedite research by circumventing the delays in collecting specimens prospectively. These specimens will be used for research in the ALS Center of Hope at Drexel University College of Medicine and shared with any outside investigator with a valid IRB approved protocol.",ALS

NCT02781454,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily motor neurons, for which treatment designed to slow or arrest progression remains lacking. Mexiletine is a use-dependent sodium channel blocker that has been FDA-approved for decades for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and more recently to treat neuropathic pain in diabetic polyneuropathy. Mexiletine has been shown also to be protective of neurons following spinal cord, head injury, and cerebral ischemia, largely by blocking excitotoxicity. Based on previous studies, mexiletine appears to penetrate into the central nervous system at concentrations sufficient to confer significant protection. Recent unpublished studies in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Brown at the University of Massachusetts have also demonstrated that mexiletine ingestion in mice genetically engineered to express high levels of mutant cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) transgene prolongs survival in these animals. As mexiletine already has FDA-approval as an anti-arrhythmic agent, much is known about the pharmacology and safety of this drug in non-ALS patients. We anticipate that by excluding subjects with a known history of cardiac disease and with the known neuroprotectant properties of this medication, mexiletine is a good choice for further study in an ALS clinical trial.",ALS

NCT00355576,"Excess free radicals, energy mishandling, excitotoxicity, activation of cell death pathways and inflammation likely all contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS. Past trials may have been negative in part because they tested single agents, usually influencing only one mechanism of cell death. Combinations of agents that affect different and multiple mechanisms of neurodegeneration may be necessary to reach meaningful outcomes in trials of ALS.||This trial has several unique features. First, it compares the neuroprotective potential of two combinations of agents that impact multiple mechanisms of cell death. The combinations of minocycline/creatine and celecoxib/creatine are the only agents that have had additive effects in the mouse model of ALS, reducing neurodegeneration and prolonging survival more than individual agents alone. Second, it uses an important new phase II selection trial design to determine which combination is superior. Not only does this trial test combination therapy, but there is no placebo, so everyone who enrolls in the trial will receive active treatment.||Minocycline, creatine and celecoxib have been tested individually and have been shown to be safe in patients with ALS. This will be the first time human trials will be conducted with combinations of minocycline/creatine and celecoxib/creatine.||We will compare combinations of drugs in a phase II trial design to determine which combination is superior. If successful, this trial will lead directly to a phase III trial of the selected combination. If the design is found useful, this trial will lead to larger phase II selection trials assessing greater numbers of agents simultaneously, thereby improving the efficiency of drug screening in ALS.",ALS

NCT02795897,"In all patients, ALS/MND is caused by the progressive death of motor neurons. However, every patient is affected differently. Some develop symptoms in their 80's while others get sick in adolescence. Swallowing/speech are affected first in some patients, but most have weakness in their hands or feet at onset. Some individuals show very rapid progression, even as others live for decades. Finally, some patients have loss of mainly motor neurons in the brain (as in primary lateral sclerosis), while others lose mainly lower motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem (as in progressive muscular atrophy). Research has uncovered a few genetic factors that contribute to the variability of ALS/MND. For example, mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene makes onset in the legs more likely and decreases the chance of developing dementia. Conversely, having a mutated C9ORF72 gene makes dementia much more likely. Uncovering additional factors causing ALS variability is an important research priority and is likely to provide clues about how to better diagnose and treat the disease.||This study is called ""Genomic Translation for ALS Care"" (GTAC). The investigators will analyze the genome and gene expression patterns of people with ALS/MND and carry out research on that data, finding insights that the investigators hope will translate into better care for ALS/MND patients.",ALS

Minocycline-a medication currently approved by the FDA for treatment of bacterial infections-is a tetracycline antibiotic with high central nervous system penetration when taken orally. The drug inhibits the activity of iNOS and caspase enzymes.||Minocycline has been tested and shown to protect nerve cells in many scientific experiments. It reduces cell death and prolongs survival in animal models of ALS, stroke, trauma, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

NCT02572479,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a currently incurable, multifactorial motor neuron disease characterized by upper and lower motor neuron degeneration, skeletal muscle atrophy, paralysis, and death. Multiple mechanisms caused by genetic and environmental factors proposed as responsible for ALS pathogenesis include decreased availability to neurotrophic factors, disturbances in calcium metabolism, increased neuroinflammatory status, cytoskeletal changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysfunction of protein degradation, glutamate excitotoxicity, apoptosis and oxidative stress.||Currently, the only available drug to treat ALS is riluzole which slightly prolongs life. Nutritional management has become more important in the treatment of ALS because body mass index and nutritional status seems to be independent, prognostic factors for survival and disease complications. Malnutrition is common in ALS, so caloric supplementation is essential. Additionally, many ALS patients self-medicate with vitamins, herbs, and other dietary supplements.||The objective of the current project is establishing the link between nutritional intake and disease status and progress. In detail, we like to assess if the improved outcomes are associated with specific nutrients, or simply the provision of excess calories. In this context, one of the most promising dietary candidates are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and in particular the long-chain n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid. This important structural component in neuronal membranes plays a role in neurogenesis and neuroprotection as well as exerts well-described anti-inflammatory effects in the brain.||The proposed observational trial will collect substantial data concerning dietary intake documented by ALS patients (Food Frequency Protocols, FFPs, periodic over 5 days) combined with the analysis of fatty acid distribution in erythrocyte lipids which reflects fatty acid distribution of the consumed fatty or oily foods (time period: approximately the last 2-3 months).||The fatty aids distribution in erythrocyte lipids as well as the nutrient intake calculated by FFPs are related to disease status and progress.||Thus, the current research activities focus on identification of dietary factors that are associated with disease progress or survival to develop beneficial interventions and therapy options.",ALS

NCT00847847,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving motor neurons of the motor cortex, brain stem and spinal cord. Its pathogenesis remains unknown, and the only drug currently available, riluzole, only modestly prolongs survival. Consistent data show that neuromuscular transmission is impaired in patients with ALS. The significance of these abnormalities remains unknown, but recent data suggest that they potentially play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) dysfunction may appear very early in the disease, as shown by data in animal models. The mechanisms of this neuromuscular transmission impairment are unknown. Nogo A belonging to the family of neurite outgrowth inhibitor proteins which is abnormally expressed in skeletal muscle of ALS patients, is probably involved as it has been shown that over-expression of Nogo A in wild-type muscle leads to destabilization of NMJs. A detailed study of the structure and function of the NMJ in ALS patient is mandatory to better characterize the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated.||The aim of this study is to characterize the neuromuscular transmission dysfunction in ALS. For this purpose, we will study the structural and functional features of NMJs on muscle biopsies in a group of 20 ALS patients compared to 10 controls. Using biopsies of a vestigial muscle, the anconeus, we will perform a morphological study of the NMJ, including routine histochemistry, immunohistochemical studies for NMJ major proteins and immune IgG complexes and electron microscopy study. The number of acetylcholine receptors per endplate will be determined by radiolabeled alpha-bungarotoxin binding. Expression levels of Nogo-A will be determined in muscle specimens by western blot. Synaptic transmission at individual NMJs will also be studied ex vivo. We will record membrane potential over time using different nerve stimulation frequencies and we will analyze the properties of the miniature endplate potentials (spontaneous release of acetylcholine) and endplate potentials after stimulation of the nerve (evoked release of acetylcholine).

NCT00560287,"Background||Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) has been increasingly used as a treatment of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Its use in patients affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders is still controversial, while most of the studies performed in restrictive thoracic disorders (RTD), and in particular in neuromuscular patients, suggested alleviation of the symptoms of chronic hypoventilation in the short term, and in two small studies survival was prolonged. As a matter of fact a recent Cochrane review stated that ""long-term mechanical ventilation should be offered as a therapeutic option to patients with chronic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular diseases"". Recurrent episodes of nocturnal desaturation especially during REM sleep may deeply influence the prognosis of patients affect by these disorders (i.e. ALS), and they are often associated with hypercapnia, so that the correction of nocturnal hypoventilation seems to be the major goal to achieve with the ventilatory treatment.||A very recent randomized controlled trial show that in ALS without severe bulbar dysfunction, NIV improves survival with maintenance of, and improvement in, quality of life, including sleep quality. The survival benefit from NIV in this group is much greater than that from currently available neuroprotective therapy, like riluzole.||Most of the studies performed in RTD disorders were performed using a pressure assisted mode (i.e Pressure Support Ventilation), because of the supposed better tolerance of the patients and easy of settings for the operators, even though this has never been scientifically proven.||In the terminal phase of the disease, when the respiratory muscles became weaker it is very likely that the operators need to frequently adjust the level of inspiratory pressure in an attempt to guarantee an adequate tidal volume, so that alveolar hypoventilation may be avoided.||Theoretically the use of a volume assisted ventilation may overpass this problem of frequent variations of the settings, since the provision of a fixed tidal volume may always guarantee and adequate alveolar ventilation.||The primary aims of this multicenter randomized study are to evaluate the clinical efficacy, the patients' tolerance and quality of life and the frequency of changing settings in a group of patients with SLS and initial chronic respiratory failure undergoing long-term NIV with Pressure Support Ventilation or Volume Assisted Ventilation.||Aim of the Project||The primary aims of the project are to evaluate the clinical efficacy, the patients' tolerance and quality of life and the frequency of changing settings in a group of patients with SLS and initial chronic respiratory failure undergoing long-term NIV with Pressure Support Ventilation or Volume Assisted Ventilation.||• Enrollment criteria: Patients with the diagnosis of ALS and one of the following signs: 1) Vital Capacity < 50% predicted 2) a Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) < 60% predicted 3) polygraphic signs of nocturnal hypoventilation with daytime symptoms.||- The patients will be randomized to receive NIV with one of the following modes: 1) Pressure Support Ventilation with the inspiratory pressure set according to the patient's tolerance in order to achieve an expired tidal volume > 6 ml/Kg and <8ml/Kg.

NCT02288091,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Multiple lines of evidence have implicated oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of ALS. Urate (uric acid) is an endogenous antioxidant system, and urate may serve as a major defense against oxidative stress. Urate has emerged as a promising neuro-protectant and therapeutic target based on convergent epidemiological, laboratory, and clinical data in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD, urate elevation has been pursued as a potential therapy by administration of inosine, a urate precursor that is available as an over-the-counter supplement. Administration of inosine results in a predictable elevation of urate levels and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in PD.||Analysis of ALS databases revealed that higher urate levels are an independent predictor of slower progression and prolonged survival in ALS. However, whether elevating urate in people with ALS would result in better outcomes is unknown. As a first step towards development of inosine as a potential treatment for ALS, in this study we will test whether inosine administration in ALS is safe and correlates with changes in the levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress and damage (as biomarkers of the intended biological effect).||The primary outcome measures will be safety, as measured by adverse events and clinically meaningful changes in vital signs, physical examination, and standard clinical laboratory tests, and tolerability, defined as the ability of subjects to complete the entire 12-week study.||The secondary objective of the study is to quantify the effect of the treatment on biomarkers of oxidative damage and stress.||An exploratory objective of the study is to measure whether changes in these biomarkers are different in people with bulbar-onset ALS compared to people with limb-onset ALS.||This study will be conducted in people who meet the El Escorial criteria of possible, laboratory-supported probable, probable, or definite criteria for a diagnosis of ALS.

Twenty patients with definite ALS will be enrolled and will be allocated to the treatment: 10 active and 10 sham stimulation. Patients will be randomly allocated by one of the investigators not involved in follow-up evaluations and data analysis. Stratified block randomisation will be performed such that the two treatment groups will be evenly balanced for disease severity, as evaluated with the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R), and duration. The patients and the neurologists assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment.||Outcome measures Patients will be evaluated at the beginning of the treatment and every month until the end of the study at 1 year. At each visit, patients will be evaluated using the ALSFRS-R and manual muscle testing (MMT). MMT testing will be performed by means of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale. To obtain an estimate of the overall limb muscle strength we will calculate a MRC compound score by adding the MRC scores of eight upper limb muscles and five lower limb muscles for each side and dividing the sum by the number of muscles tested (26 muscles).

The stimulation intensity will be 80 % of the active motor threshold (AMT), defined as the minimum single pulse intensity required to produce a motor evoked potential greater than 200 uV on more than five out of ten trials from the contracted contralateral first interosseous muscle. This protocol leads to pronounced and prolonged suppression of cortical excitability that reaches a maximum about 5-10 min after the end of the stimulation.||Sham rTMS will be performed using the same stimulator connected to the placebo butterfly coil MCF-P-B-65 which has no stimulating effect on the cortex but produces similar auditory and tactile sensations as the active coil. The site of stimulation and the number of stimuli will be identical to those used for the active magnetic rTMS.||Repetitive TMS will be performed bilaterally.

NCT00919555,"Physicians at Phoenix Neurological Associates (PNA) are looking for individuals diagnosed with ALS to participate in a double-blind, placebo controlled study of Tretinoin and Pioglitazone HCL, used in combination with Riluzole, for treating ALS. This investigator initiated trial conducted by Dr. Todd Levine and Dr. David Saperstein will help determine whether Tretinoin and Pioglitazone HCL, in combination, can slow the progression of ALS.||At present, there is little to no effective therapy for ALS, nor is there a known cause. Therefore there is a tremendous unmet need for more effective therapy for this disease and that is why the physicians at PNA have been very interested in the role of developing a more active anti-excitotoxic cocktail for patients with ALS. Since recent data have suggested that inflammatory mechanisms may interact with and promote neurodegeneration (where cells in the spinal cord and brain are lost), there have been a number of anti-inflammatory treatment strategies that have been evaluated in animal models. Some studies have shown that mice that were given Pioglitazone HCL demonstrated improved muscle strength and body weight, exhibited a delayed disease onset as well as had a longer survival rate compared to non treated mice.||In addition to these studies, retinoic acids have been studied extensively in various models of the injured nervous system. These studies have shown that retinoic acids, such as Tretinoin may be neuroprotective and support axonal growth, which could in turn slow disease progression.||The purpose of this study is to determine if such a drug ""cocktail"" could offer the best chance of attaining a significant reduction in disease progression by utilizing currently available FDA-approved agents",ALS

NCT00838617,"Protocol for the Study - Muscle Ultrasound: A New Tool for Measuring Progression in ALS||A. Specific Aims The authors propose to study the change in muscle mass over time in patients with ALS. Muscle atrophy is a very common feature of the disease, and in clinical experience correlates with progressing weakness. As such, it is a qualitative marker of disease progress, although this lacks a quantitative marker. Muscle ultrasound is a safe, noninvasive, and rapid method of measuring muscle volume or thickness (1). Recently Arts, et al published an assessment of muscle ultrasound, specifically including reduced muscle depth and increased ultrasound echogenicity (2). We believe determining quantitatively the rate of progression of muscle mass in a group of patients with ALS will lead to a clinically useful tool to serve as a marker of disease progression, which may be useful in clinical trials for new therapies for this disease.||B. Background and Significance ALS is a quickly progressive disease that results in skeletal muscle weakness, including ventilatory weakness, which is the ultimate cause of death for the vast majority of patients with ALS. Median survival from diagnosis is less than 3 years. There is only one drug approved to treat ALS, riluzole, and its effects to limit the progression of the illness are slight (6). Current study designs often use a primary endpoint of either death from ALS or initiation of long-term mechanical ventilation (LTMV). There are other tools to assess progression, which can include a questionnaire called the ALS functional rating scale (ALS-FRS), a direct measurement of strength, or an electromyography technique called motor unit number estimate (MUNE). Each has potential drawbacks, which include potential lack of objectivity in questionnaire and variable effort when assessing direct strength measurements. There has also been work to correlate magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings to progression in ALS, with some positive results (3). However, this technology is expensive, time consuming, and not widely available. Muscle ultrasound may be sensitive enough to quantitatively detect changes in muscle thickness (4), which may serve as an objective tool to measure disease progression, for the purpose of clinical trials. Muscle echointensity (EI) is also abnormal in ALS (2, 4), although this assessment is less reliable among different observers and ultrasound settings, resulting in less diagnostic precision. Normal values for muscle thickness and echointensity are available, with norms varying by age and weight (5). Muscle ultrasound is readily available, noninvasive, inexpensive, and could be used in the context of a clinical examination. Muscle ultrasound is painless and can be completed in a few minutes.||C. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report As this is a pilot study, there is no preliminary data using muscle ultrasound longitudinally in patients with ALS. The study by Arts et al used muscle ultrasound to assist in the ALS diagnosis, but to our knowledge, muscle ultrasound has not been used to detect longitudinal changes in the illness. This study will help in the development of future studies testing pharmacologic agents in ALS, by providing muscle ultrasound as a validated endpoint in the progression of ALS.||D. Research Design and Methods Ten patients will be recruited to participate, and will have serial muscle ultrasound examinations every three months, at regularly scheduled clinic appointments in the Vanderbilt ALS clinic. Muscles examined will include forearm flexors, biceps, and tibialis anterior. The thickness of each muscle will be measured at standard sites for these muscles, in addition to the echogenicity as measured by a grayscale histogram representation. The rate of loss of ultrasound-measured muscle thickness will be assessed over time. Our hypothesis is that there will be significant loss of muscle thickness over time, which will correlate with disease severity. As different patients have different rates of deterioration, there will likely be significant differences in the rate of muscle volume loss from patient to patient. A secondary endpoint will be an increase over time in muscle echogenicity. Patients will complete the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), a 12 item subjective scale that assesses several motor functions, including function of speech, swallowing, respiration, and activities of daily living. Grip strength will be measured by hand grip dynamometry, using the best result from 3 attempts in each limb. Secondary analyses will also be conducted to correlate the decrease in ultrasound-measure muscle depth with the ALS Functional-Rating Scale, and with measures from hand grip dynamometry.||The study will be conducted over a period of 8 months. All patient data will be kept in a password-secured online database called REDcap. Any adverse events will be reported to the IRB, as none are expected with this safe diagnostic modality.||E. Inclusion Criteria||All patients must meet the El Escorial criterion for definite or probable ALS.|Patients forced vital capacity (FVC) must exceed 50%.||F. Exclusion Criteria||Patients with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and other forms of motor neuron disorders will not participate.|Patients with severe weakness from ALS who require continuous mechanical ventilation, who have a forced vital capacity less than 50%, or who have no clinically measurable strength in the arms and legs.|Patients without cognitive capacity to give informed consent. This is not a clinical feature of ALS, and therefore such patients would have an alternate diagnosis that would prevent such capacity.||G. Privacy/Confidentiality This is minimized by using study numbers, and labeling all patient data with study numbers and no other identifying information. The medical record numbers that correspond to each study number will be stored only in REDcap, a secure, password-protected database.||H. Human Subjects Research/Risks Careful consideration will be given to the protection of subjects from research risks and to the appropriate inclusion of women and minorities in the subjects who will be studied. Research risks are substantially limited by the noninvasive nature of muscle ultrasound, and the absence of any pharmacologic intervention in the study. There is a theoretical risk of breach of confidentiality, which is minimized as noted in the section above.||I. Reporting of Adverse Events/Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or Others The PI will report to the IRB in the event of an adverse event involving any participant, study personnel, or others, either from procedures involved in the study, or in the event of breach of participant confidentiality. These risks are minimized as noted above.||J. Statistical Considerations As this is a pilot study, this is not powered to likely find a statistically significant difference. Nonetheless, a mixed effect model statistical evaluation of the changes in muscle ultrasound values will be carried out for analysis.||K. Follow-up and Record Retention At the conclusion of the study, the study data will be maintained electronically only, in secure, encrypted format by the PI on REDcap for 6 years. After that time, any data not submitted to the patient's StarPanel electronic record will be destroyed.",ALS
NCT00956501,"ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving primarily upper and lower motor neurons. The progressive loss in motor neurons leads to weakness, fatigue, spasticity, and loss of balance. Falls are reported in 30-35% of ALS patients prior to enrolment to ALS clinic. This early loss of balance may not be detected by the classical neurological exam, or the standard clinical balance scales. Understanding the impairments in the balance control system which leads to fall during the course of ALS is a prerequisite for the clinical decision-making process in order to develop a proper balance rehabilitation program and fall prevention strategies for these patients.||Patients and control subjects will undergo balance system evaluation consisting of the following testing:||Sensory Organization Test Protocol||Standardized EquiTest assessment protocol:||Sensory Organization Test (SOT) - will be used to measure change how well participants maintain balance under progressively more difficult test conditions, which either disrupt or remove visual and proprioceptive feedback. Visual and proprioceptive environments will be altered systematically for fixed support and sway-referenced support and surround conditions, and under normal (eyes open), absent (eyes closed), and sway-referenced vision (eyes sway-referenced). Under sway-referenced conditions, the platform on which the subject stands and/or the visual surround also move proportionally to their AP sway. During SRC the floor and visual surround are controlled by a servomechanism (Gain=1.0) to follow movements of the subjects' center of gravity. Sway-referencing eliminates accurate somatosensory and/or visual information used to orient the body. Performance under sway-referenced visual conditions shows the participant's ability to suppress conflicting visual inputs and to rely on alternative systems for maintaining equilibrium (table 1).||Participants are carefully positioned on the platform by aligning the lateral malleoli with the axis of rotation of the platform and visual surround. Participants wear a harness during all testing, which protects participants from falling. As an additional safety measure, the technician stands behind the participant. There are three trials per condition with each trial lasting 20 seconds. When a participant takes a step, touches the surround panels, or needs assistance from the technician, that trial is marked as a fall and the participant receives an equilibrium score of zero for that trial.||In addition to the ES, movement strategy scores (MSS) will be measured by horizontal shear forces. Movement strategy scores reflect the relative use of movement about the ankle, hips and upper body to maintain balance during the SOT. Scores around 100 reflect a predominant use of ankle strategy to maintain balance, whereas low scores are indicative of the use of hip strategies to restore stability.||Motor Control Test Protocol The Motor Control Test (MCT), using the same apparatus will be performed to examine postural responses to external perturbations. During the MCT, subjects will receive perturbation from the force platform. Perturbations are expressed as translation movement (medium horizontal anterior to posterior movements of less than 1 sec. duration) or as rotation movements (at 6.0 degrees per second, which cause ankle dorsiflexion or plantarflexion). Six forward and six backward translations are generated. Five toes up and five toes down rotations are generated. The computer assures random delays of 1.5 to 2.5 seconds between translation trials and 3.0 to 5.0 seconds between rotation trials. During each perturbation, the computer monitors the subjects sway responses, measuring forces exerted against the dual force plate. These forces are expressed as weight symmetry and strength symmetry. Weight symmetry measures the distribution of total body weight over each leg, independent of other response strength and strength symmetry measures. Weight symmetry scores near 100 indicate a symmetrical weight distribution (EquiTest manual, 1991).||Outcome variables:||i. Sensory Organization Test (SOT) scores on conditions 1-6. ii. Movement Strategy Score on conditions 1-6 iii. Weight Symmetry Score on conditions 1-6",ALS

NCT02759913,"ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rapidly progressive, degenerative disease of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord that leads to muscle atrophy and spasticity in limb and bulbar muscles. Clinical presentations of this fatal disease include weakness, loss of ambulation, oropharyngeal dysfunction, weight loss, and ultimately respiratory failure. Average survival is approximately 3 years after symptom onset. The initial symptoms are similar to other neuropathies (e.g., motor neuropathy, progressive muscle atrophy, etc.) and include limb weakness leading to partial or total paralysis, and increasing difficulties in speech and breathing. ALS clinical diagnosis typically takes 12 months from symptom onset and relies on exclusion of other potential causes of the clinical symptoms. To date there are no FDA-approved diagnostic tests for ALS. Diagnostic tools for accurate and early diagnosis are under investigation. These tools would not only permit early intervention, but also would improve clinical trial design for new drug therapies.||Axonal degeneration and inflammation are among proposed pathogenic mechanisms for ALS; therefore, proteins that function within these pathways are being evaluated as potential biomarkers. Iron Horse Diagnostics, Inc. (Iron Horse) has focused its ALS diagnostic efforts on studying the levels of cytoskeletal and inflammatory proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients.||Cytoskeletal proteins, including neurofilament proteins and tau, have been shown to be elevated in the CSF of patients with various neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, levels of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit (pNfH) have been found to be significantly increased in the CSF of ALS patients as compared with healthy subjects, Alzheimer's disease patients or disease mimics Numerous inflammatory proteins, including cytokines and complement proteins, have been shown to be altered in ALS; complement proteins, including complement c3 (C3), have been found to be increased in the CSF of ALS patients.||Iron Horse has evaluated CSF samples from 106 subjects (45 ALS patients, 25 disease controls with a range of neurodegenerative conditions, and 36 healthy controls.CSF levels of pNfH, tau, C3, and C reactive protein (CRP) were measured. pNfH was significantly elevated in CSF from ALS subjects as compared with healthy and disease controls; there were no significant differences for CRP or tau. To further distinguish between ALS subjects and disease controls, data from cytoskeletal and inflammatory pathways were combined. A ratio of CSF levels of pNfH and C3 showed significant differences between ALS and both the disease and healthy control groups. Results were verified on a separate test set of CSF samples. Overall, the predictive pNfH/C3 ratio identified ALS with 87.3 % sensitivity and 94.6% specificity in a total of 71 ALS subjects, 52 disease control subjects, and 40 healthy subjects.||In the same study, it was observed that plasma levels of pNfH were significantly elevated in ALS subjects as compared with healthy controls; however there was no significant difference between ALS and disease controls. Comparison of pNfH levels between the CSF and plasma for each study subject revealed a weak correlation between plasma and CSF pNfH levels.||The accuracy of pNfH and pNfH/C3 ratio as ALS predictors has also been tested by Iron Horse in a recent prospective, blinded study in collaboration with the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) [unpublished data]. CSF (n=126) and plasma (n=220) samples were collected from subjects from 30 medical centers across the United States (US) who were undergoing diagnostic assessment for neurodegenerative conditions or who were recently diagnosed with ALS. Accuracy for predicting ALS diagnosis was 93% for CSF pNfH/C3 ratio and 82% for pNfH plasma levels.||The prospective study proposed in this concept will test the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of pNfH and pNfH/C3 ratio as ALS predictors on a separate sample set. CSF and matching plasma samples will be collected at up to 6 neurodegenerative clinics from up to 300 subjects who were recently diagnosed with ALS or another similar neurologic disease or who are currently undergoing diagnostic procedures.",ALS
NCT04430686,"Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in motor neuron disease (MND) patients. Symptoms of respiratory dysfunction in MND patients include sleep disturbance, excessive daytime somnolence, morning headaches and cognitive changes. Almost all MND patients will develop respiratory problems during the course of their disease. In a small percentage of MND patients, respiratory failure may present as the primary symptom at onset, whereas more commonly it develops later in the disease. (1) Forced vital capacity (FVC), taken either supine or erect, is the most commonly used measurement tool of respiratory function. Such measures are well recognized predictors of survival (2), with supine FVC a more accurate marker of diaphragmatic weakness (1). However, FVC may not be sensitive for the detection of early respiratory failure and can be technically difficult to perform in patients with severe bulbar weakness (3). Other respiratory measures include maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) and, less commonly, formal assessment of arterial blood gases (ABG). Interpretation of the trends of these measures over time, combined with the clinical picture, determines appropriate respiratory management. Significantly, the advent of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has provided clear benefit in terms of improving symptoms, QOL and prolonging survival by up to 7 months in MND patients, making NIV a central armamentarium of respiratory management in these patients (4) Bilevel ventilation devices (Bi-PAP) are most commonly used as initial therapy. There are no established evidence-based guidelines regarding optimal timing for initiation of NIV.Some studies suggest that an early introduction of NIV may increase survival (5), reduce respiratory-related energy expenditure (6) and improve adherence to therapy and QOL (7).Once initiated, poor optimisation of NIV represents an independent risk factor for mortality (8) However, there are no randomized control trial data available that have compared the specific parameters of bilevel modes of ventilation across various patient cohorts. Different strategies have been used to optimize patient comfort, including adjusting the type of mask and fittings, providing humidified air and testing different Bi-PAP pressure settings. Despite these measures, up to 30% of MND patients cannot tolerate therapy due to secondary effects of anxiety, emotional lability from pseudobulbar palsy, excessive salivation, claustrophobia and nasal bridge soreness (8) Importantly, the key factors that affect overall compliance with this treatment are the presence of bulbar dysfunction with bulbar onset patients six times less likely to tolerate NIV than those with limb onset disease (9) Future efforts must be focused on determining more accurate testing for early respiratory failure, optimal time to initiate NIV and the comfortable adaptation of NIV devices for patients with bulbar weakness",ALS
NCT00136110,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons leading to muscle weakness.||The pathogenesis of ALS is unknown, but there is convincing evidence that several molecular mechanisms play a role. Previous studies investigated the role of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) gene in ALS. Recent data suggest that SMN genotypes producing less SMN protein increase susceptibility and severity of ALS. This leads to the hypothesis that the clinical expression of ALS is influenced by the total SMN protein level in affected patients. In a population of ALS patients in the Netherlands we found that SMN genotypes producing less SMN protein appear to increase susceptibility and severity of ALS. It was shown that the HDAC inhibitor sodium valproate (SVP) increases levels of SMN protein in vitro. From these results and from data suggesting neuroprotective properties of SVP, it is hypothesised that SVP could extend survival of patients with ALS. In addition, sodium valproate significantly prolonged the disease duration in the animal model for ALS, the SOD1 transgenic mouse. Given that SVP is a FDA-approved compound with well-known pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles, it is an attractive candidate for a clinical trial in ALS patients.",ALS

NCT02325375,"Introduction Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease with progressive muscle weakness leading to severe disability and eventually death. It is the most common form of motor neuron diseases and involves both the upper and lower motor neurons. The median survival from debut of symptoms to dead is approximately 3 years.||Since the diagnosis relies on clinical features and electromyographic abnormalities, which may occur rather late in the disease course, there is a need to identify diagnostic tests that can confirm or exclude the diagnosis of ALS in the earlier phase of the disease.||ALS is a neurodegenerative disease, however the pathogenesis is not well established. The causes are probably multifactorial and a complex interaction between genetic factors and dysfunction of vital molecular pathways concerning the dominantly inherited c9orf72 gene and impaired glutamate uptake in astrocytes (EAAT2-receptor) from the synaptic cleft and thereby glutamate excitotoxicity. This glutamate excitotoxicity may cause oxidative stress, voltage-gated persistent sodium channels and activation of microglia resulting in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines.||More recently, there are studies suggesting neuroinflammation to play a role for the development of ALS. A study from 2012 (a mouse model of ALS, that overexpress mutant superoxide dismutase (mSOD1)), has documented that microglia can both protect and injure the motor neurones depending on which phenotype of the microglia is activated. It seems like it is a continuum between the protective M2 phenotypic state (disease onset) and the neurotoxic M1 phenotypic state (disease end-stage). Furthermore, at disease onset the mice expressed higher levels of Ym1, CD163 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (markers of M2).||Of other molecular mechanisms, it is worth to mention the structural and functional abnormalities of mitochondria, impairment of axonal transport systems and endosomal trafficking and induction of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response although they appear to be secondary events in ALS. The net result is degeneration of motor neurones in cerebral cortex, the cranial nerve nuclei, the anterior horn of the spinal cord and the corticospinal tracts. The only present treatment available is Riluzole that has proven to extend life or time to onset of serious respiratory problems in patients with ALS. The mode of action for Riluzole still has to be determined, possibly the dynamic is an inhibition of glutamate release from the presynaptic neuron. (1,2,3,4,5,6) Though it seems that the inflammatory process is a secondary event, it seems to be critical for neuronal degeneration. In a study, ALS pathology was sought to be reduced through central nervous system targeted glucocorticoid and succeeded by reducing brainstem pathology in mouse models of ALS. Of different biomarkers, inflammatory markers have also been tested: the interleukin-1 family cytokines. Among them only total interleukin-18, its endogenous inhibitor interleukin-18BP, and the active form of the cytokine (free interleukin-18) were significantly higher in the ALS patients than in controls. The cytokine showed no correlation to the different clinical forms of ALS or the clinical setting of the disease. Cytokines have also been tried as neuroprotective agents. Erythropoietin (EPO) is known as the growth factor that maintains the number of circulating erythrocytes. However, the biological role of EPO has been expanded to other cells, such as neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in the brain. EPO seems to suppress the proinﬂammatory cytokines during disease progression, maintain the anti-inﬂammatory cytokines until the late symptomatic stage and finally seems to delay symptom onset and preserve number of motor neurons. (7,8,9,10) Cluster of differentiation 163 (CD-163) - a new way to monitor inflammation in ALS? CD-163 is a scavenger receptor (recognizes and uptakes macromolecules) which marks the monocyte-macrophage activation. CD163 works for macrophages as a receptor for hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes. The soluble form of the receptor is called sCD163 and is found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, where it is found to be up regulated in a large range of inflammatory diseases.||Strongly increased values (>20mg/l) is seen in diseases like macrophage activating syndrome,hemophagocytic syndrome and acute hepatic failure. Furthermore, the level of sCD163 reflects the activity of the disease. Patients with increasing and high values are found to have unfavorable prognosis. Increased values (5-20 mg/l) are seen in hepatic disease, sepsis and Gaucher's disease. Septic patients with values greater than 10 mg/l have a 10 times greater risk of fatal outcome. Values which is increased a little (3-5 mg/l) is often seen in inflammatory of infectious conditions and in cancer. (11,12,13,14) Pilot data At the investigators lab, pilot data (Kallestrup M et al, unpublished data (15)) has shown promising results. There was an increased level of sCD163 in cerebrospinal fluid in 7 patients with ALS compared with controls. Furthermore, both definite and probable ALS patients have an increased level of sCD163. These results suggest a larger study to be performed evaluating patients with ALS at early as well as later stages of the disease.||Hypothesis Patients with ALS have up-regulated levels of sCD-163 in their cerebrospinal fluid and serum compared with healthy subjects and the level is related to the severity of the disease.||Purpose To define the concentration of sCD-163 in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum in patients with ALS compared with controls (patients with unspecified neurological symptoms). Furthermore, we will define the concentrations of protein, glucose, immunoglobulin G index and other factors in the spinal fluid.||Method Study population The study population will be all patients with established and suspected ALS at the Department of Neurology, Aarhus University Hospital.||Patients with established ALS who participate will undergo lumbar puncture as a part of this study. Subjects suspected to suffer from ALS will undergo lumbar puncture as a part of their diagnostic work up and the level of sCD163 in their cerebrospinal fluid will be analysed.||At the Department of Neurology, Aarhus University Hospital there are approximately 80 patients with established ALS. We expect that 50 of these patients are willing to participate and are eligible for inclusion (31-08-2015). Furthermore, we expect to include 8 patients who will be diagnosed with ALS at Department of Neurology, Aarhus University Hospital during the study period.||The controls include patients with various neurological symptoms or diseases who will undergo a lumbar puncture at the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital as part of their diagnostic work-up irrespective of this study. In the final analyses only controls will be included who end up having either no neurological disease or a neurological disease which is believed not to involve the spinal fluid. We expect to include 40-50 controls.||Recruitment Participants will receive written and oral information about the study. The oral information will take place at Department of Neurology, Aarhus University Hospital. Moreover, the pamphlet ""Forsøgspersoners rettigheder i et sundhedsvidenskabeligt forskningsprojekt"" will be handed out. Consultants at the department of neurology will give the information, to patients with suspected ALS. Controls and patients with established ALS will receive information from the doctors at the department of Neurology and research year student Anne Sofie Vinther.||It is possible to bring a companion and the participants are offered at least 24 hours to consider participation.||Access to patient records will be requested, which will be provided in the written information material.||If new knowledge about disadvantages of participating in the study appears the participants will be informed immediately. Moreover, the participant will be informed if evaluations during the study bring knowledge about the general health status of the patient, unless this has been clearly rejected by the patient.||By the end of the study it is possible for participants to contact the study coordinator to get information about study results.||All participants will receive information about the research project and will be asked to give their content to participation. The participation implies extraction of 5-6 ml spinal fluid and a blood sample (30ml), which will be used for analysis of sCD-163.||Participants will not receive any form of payment, but can receive compensation for transportation.||Inclusion criteria:||ALS Patients diagnosed with ALS and patients suspected to have ALS. Age >18 Controls Age >18||Exclusion criteria (for all groups):||Acute infections including neuroinfection Other disorders known to have elevated levels of sCD163 Disorders or treatments that contraindicate a lumbar puncture. Other established neurological disorders. At all times during the diagnostic work-up and consequently in the research project we will do this with respect for the patients mental and physical condition. The research project will be carried out according to the Act on Processing of Personal Data and, furthermore, the project will be submitted to the common regional information system for Region Midtjylland.||Analysis The spinal fluid and the serum will be analysed at the Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital. The spinal fluid and blood samples will be deposited in a research biobank at Aarhus University Hospital. It is planned that all biochemical analyses will be performed when all samples are collected. At the end of the project, the samples will be pseudo anonymised. Due to the possibility of developing new knowledge in this area, the samples will be deposited in the biobank 5 years after this project has been finished.||The concentrations of sCD-163 in spinal fluid and serum will be analyzed by already established techniques at the Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital.||Examination The examination consists of a medical history and a clinical examination. We use the Revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R), which is at rating instrument for monitoring the progression of disability in patients with ALS. Information from the medical record will be included and used in this project including past medical history, actual use of drugs, results of biochemical analyses and brain imaging, results from the ALSFRS-R, results from the electromyography, abnormalities at the clinical examinations and the conclusions from the diagnostic work-up.||Power and Statistical analyses Since the investigators pilot data (n=7) showed a 50% increase in the level of CD163 in the cerebrospinal fluid in ALS patients inclusion of 40 patients is expected to enable detection of smaller difference also in serum and relations between CD163 and clinical findings.||The program ANOVA will be used for statistical analyses. Parametric or non-parametric tests will be used depending of the normal distribution of data. In all statistical analysis a 5% level of significance will be used.||Perspectives It is of importance to identify prognostic biomarkers in ALS. The pathology of ALS is still unknown but it seems that inflammation is a crucial factor in the process. In several studies, sCD163 has shown to be up regulated in a large range of inflammatory diseases and together with the investigators promising pilot data sCD163 is a potential marker for ALS. (4) The assessment of drug efficacy in ALS remains clinically based, relying on measuring the rate of disease progression through the utilization of the ALS rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R). Such clinical scales may be insensitive, especially in the early stages of the disease process. The development of reliable quantifiable biomarkers remains elusive in ALS, and development of prognostic biomarkers would be crucial for effective evaluation of a therapeutic agent in the early stages of development.||Ethical consideration The tests performed on the patients involved in this research project are lumbar puncture and blood samples.||It involves some risks to perform a lumbar puncture, which include post lumbar puncture headache with an incidence of 12 %, most common in younger patients. Most frequently, the headache has a short duration and it may be cured with application of a blood-patch. Moreover, lumbar puncture can cause temporary lumbar pain and an accumulation of blood underneath the skin. There is a very low risk of bleeding in the epidural space with compression of spinal nerves and an even lower risk of infections (meningitis or meningoencephalitis). However, it is important to underscore that lumbar puncture is part of routine diagnostic workup at the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital.||In consideration of the low risk involved in this project, the bad prognosis for the disease and the potential to improve diagnosis and treatment for future patients with ALS we consider this project to be ethically acceptable.||Publication Positive, negative as well as inconclusive results from this study will be published. The results will be written in an article for publication in an English written peer reviewed journal.",ALS

NCT01020331,"We have been very interested in the role of developing a more active anti-excitotoxic cocktail for patients with ALS. As part of this interest we have been investigating potential markers for disease progression. One of our candidate markers has been the presence of elevated levels of TAU in the CSF of patients with ALS. While the presence of Tau was originally described as being used for adjunctive diagnostic testing in patients with Alzheimer's disease it has become clear that many neurodegenerative diseases possess elevated levels of Tau in the CSF. Therefore Tau is truly a marker of increased neuronal death from any disease process.||While levels of Tau have not been studied in depth in ALS, there was one report in 2003 which showed that 70% of ALS patients have elevated levels of Tau in their CSF (Sussmuth et al). We have also collected a series of 24 patients with clinically definite ALS and found that 22 of them had elevated levels of Tau at the time of diagnosis.||We have been intrigued by the findings that Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, can inhibit and reverse the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of Tau which leads to sequestration of the normal Tau microtubules as well as microtubule associated protein 1 (MAP-1) and MAP-2. Further, Memantine has been shown to block the disassembly of microtubules which follows the hyperphosphorylation if Tau (Li et al., 2004).||We have submitted for presentation to the International Motor Neuron Disease meeting in 2005 the data on two anecdotal cases of patients with ALS. These two patients were diagnosed with ALS on clinical and electrophysiological data and they were found to have elevated levels of Tau in their CSF at the time of diagnosis. Both patients were treated with Riluzole, as standard therapy, and with Memantine 10 mg BID for 6 months. After 6 months their disease course was clearly very slow. A repeat analysis of their CSF showed that levels of Tau had returned to normal.",ALS

NCT01083667,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease causing relentlessly progressive weakness of the arms, legs and respiratory muscles that is uniformly fatal. There are approximately 30,000 patients living with ALS in the United States. There is no treatment. The cause is uncertain in most patients. However, 3% of patients (< 1000 in number) have a familial form of ALS (FALS), phenotypically identical to the sporadic illness, that is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for the free radical scavenging enzyme copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Inserting the SOD1 mutant gene into mice causes them to develop a disease closely resembling ALS.||Inhibiting expression of the SOD1 gene prevents animals from developing the disease. Increasing or decreasing the number of mutated genes proportionately speeds or slows the progression of the disease. Therefore, reducing SOD1 levels in patients with SOD1 associated FALS may be a promising therapeutic approach. Through an extensive in vitro screening program for medications having the ability to reduce SOD1 levels, several molecules that reduce SOD1 protein levels are known. One of the most potent molecules is pyrimethamine, an FDA approved medication used for the treatment of malaria and toxoplasmosis. Pyrimethamine dramatically reduces SOD1 levels in mice and our preliminary studies show similar findings in humans. Our study's primary objective is to determine if familial ALS patients taking pyrimethamine will show a decline in SOD1 levels in the CSF by 15% or more. We will also determine if SOD1 and pyrimethamine are present in the blood and if the SOD-1 levels decline over the course of the study. We will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of pyrimethamine in patients with FALS. Secondary objectives will be to determine dose optimization for maximal SOD1 level reduction and tolerability of medication. We will also assess the feasibility of proceeding to phase II/III studies using pyrimethamine. Change in ALS-FRS, Appel ALS score and quality of life will also be measured. A clinical effect realized in patients with FALS associated with an SOD1 mutation may serve as an important foundation toward finding a treatment for sporadic ALS.",ALS

Neurologists with expertise in ALS will review veterans' medical records to verify the diagnosis and determine eligibility. Upon enrollment, veterans will be asked to complete a brief telephone interview. Registry participants will also be contacted by telephone biannually to assess health and functional status. The VA may notify registry participants about clinical trials for which they may be eligible. A Scientific Review Committee will evaluate all studies that request use of registry data and/or access to Registry participants.||Results: N/A||Impacts: The registry will provide the VA with a valuable mechanism for involving veterans in clinical trials and other studies that may yield improved outcomes for ALS. In addition, data gathered as a part of the registry has the potential to benefit not only veterans, but also the larger community of individuals with ALS.",ALS
NCT02228915,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease in which mutations in human Cu, Zn Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1) have been identified as a cause of familial ALS (FALS) cases.1-2 It has been shown that mutant SOD1 develops a novel toxic function through experiments demonstrating that many disease mutants maintain enzymatic activity, SOD1-null mice do not exhibit ALS symptoms, and co-expressed wild type protein does not rescue the disease-state.7-11 The majority of cases, however, are not caused directly by mutations of SOD1, instead being caused by a poorly understood interplay of several genes as well as environmental factors, which is often referred to as sporadic ALS (SALS).3 It has been found that FALS and SALS share similar pathology. 4-6 The hSOD1 protein aggregates characteristic of FALS have also been found in SALS patients, furthering the evidence that hSOD1 has an important role in the etiology of ALS in sporadic ALS patients.16-19 The exact mechanism of SOD1-associated toxicity has not yet been elucidated though many disease mutants have been shown to destabilize the SOD1 dimer. In this study we aim to compare the levels of SOD1 post-tra slational modifications in ALS patients to levels in healthy donors and to determine if there are distinct patterns of protein glutathionylation or phosphorylation.

NCT03506425,"This is an open label, prospective cohort study of 10 people with ALS (PALS) from the Duke ALS Clinic. The first 5 enrolled PALS (Group 1) will receive standard ALS care for the first month, then standard care plus Triheptanoin for the next 5 months. The next 5 enrolled PALS (Group 2) will receive standard ALS care plus Triheptanoin for 6 months (Figure 1). All Group 1 and Group 2 PALS who complete this 6-month study will have an option for Triheptanoin treatment extension for an additional 12 months. In addition to the PALS, there will also be 5 healthy controls enrolled (Group 3), people that do not have ALS or any other neurodegenerative disease). These participants will not receive any treatment; the only outcome measure they will complete is serum and urine biomarker testing at screening/baseline, month 1 and month 6.||The rationale for delaying triheptanoin treatment in one group is to look for differences in MR spectroscopy related to treatment at the 1 month time point. The target triheptanoin dose for this study is 1g/kg/d. This target dose was selected because it was safe and tolerable and altered brain MR spectroscopy in patients with Huntington's Disease. Participants will taper up to this dose as follows: start at 0.25g/kg/d for 1 week, then take 0.5g/kg/d for 1 week, then take 1g/kg/d and stay on this dose for the duration of the study. Triheptanoin will be administered orally with food or by gastrostomy tube over 3 divided doses (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). If at any point after week 1 a participant does not appear to be tolerating their current dose, it will be reduced by 0.25g/kg/d. If they cannot tolerate the starting dose of 0.25g/kg/d, the treatment will be discontinued. A dietician will make contact with all participants every month, either in person or by telephone, to try and maximize compliance.||The primary outcome measure is the ALSFRS-R score obtained monthly for all treated participants (in person at screening/baseline, month 1, month 3 and month 6; via telephone at months 2, 4 and 5). We will also obtain this measure by phone at months 6 and 12 of the extension. For all enrolled PALS in Groups 1 and 2, we will compare the slope of ALSFRS-R progression before enrollment to the slop of ALSFRS-R progression during the trial. ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (five minute) ordinal rating scale (ratings 0-4) used to determine patients' assessments of their capability and independence in 13 functional activities. All 13 activities are relevant in ALS. Initial validity was established in ALS patients by documenting that their change in ALSFRS-R scores, which correlated with change in strength over time, was closely associated with quality of life measures, and predicted survival. The test-retest reliability is greater than 0.88 for all 13 itemsactivities. The ALSFRS-R declines linearly with time over a wide range during the course of ALS. The minimum clinically significant change in this scale is said to be 20%. The measure can be reliably conducted over the phone.||Secondary outcome measures include:||MR Spectroscopy NAA/Cr ratio in motor cortex will be measured at screening/baseline and 1 month time points. This measure declines over time in patients with ALS. This measure can respond to treatment; it was shown to improve over 3 weeks in patients with ALS on riluzole compared to a group that was not on this treatment. We will compare the MR spectroscopy changes over 1 month in Group 1 to the MR spectroscopy changes over 1 month in Group 2.||A Serum and Urine Biomarker Panel will be obtained at screening/baseline, 1 month and 6-month time points and analyzed using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Laboratory, pathologic, and epidemiologic evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress is central in the ALS pathogenic process, particularly in genetically susceptive individuals. Oxidative stress biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and urine are elevated, suggesting that abnormal oxidative stress is generated outside of the central nervous system. Magnitude of lipid peroxidation, measured as non-enzymatic oxidation products of arachidonic acid, F2-isoprostanes, appears the most obvious oxidative stress marker. We will measure urine F2-isoprostane metabolites (class III: iPF2α-III, and 2,3-dinor iPF-2alpha-III, class VI: iPF-2alpha-VI, and 8,12-iso-iPF-2alpha-VI), urine creatinine, and serum and urine glutamate, a-keto-glutarate, NADH, coenzyme A levels in all treated participants and healthy controls at screening/baseline, month 1 and month 6 time points. We will compare the biomarker changes at different times points across between Groups 1, 2 and 3.||For safety monitoring:, concomitant medications, vital signs, weight, physical exam and safety labs (CBC, CMP, Lipid Profile, GGT, LFT and pregnancy testing for sexually active females with child bearing potential) will be measured at screening/baseline, 1 month, 3 month, and 6-month time points. Adverse events will be monitored continuously throughout the study, as described in Section 5.1.||The primary statistical analysis is the slope of the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) during treatment compared to pre-treatment. Pre-treatment slope for each participant will be estimated as follows: (48-enrollment ALSFRS-R)/months since symptom onset. This frequently used ""pre-slope"" method is simple and inexpensive, and can predict disease progression as well as more complicated and expensive tools, at least for periods of less than 1 year.",ALS

NCT03887338,"ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a rare and fatal disease causing gradual loss of motor neurons and thus loss of function in all skeletal muscle, eventually also in the breathing muscles, leading to respiratory failure and ultimately death. There is no causal treatment. The treatment provided aims to improve life quality as long as possible. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) compensates for respiratory failure as breathing deteriorates.||ALS patients with bulbar innervated muscle dysfunction (mouth, tongue, jaw, throat, larynx) have poor compliance to the use of NIV. It is not completely understood why bulbar ALS patients fails NIV, although the upper airways have been a suggested cause also of this treatment failure. The investigators in the Norwegian study group has previously examined laryngeal response patterns (using transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy ) during mechanically assisted cough in ALS. The studies revealed that Transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy was safely performed with ongoing mechanically assisted cough, and it appeared a feasible tool to visualize the laryngeal responses to mechanical cough therapy.||The further hypothesis is that the use of transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy during ongoing NIV titration could improve the compliance of NIV treatment in ALS.||Since ALS is a relatively rare disease and it is difficult to perform large clinical studies, a project group has been established and agreed to a common protocol of a population-based multicenter-study including two hospitals, in Bergen in Norway and Vila Real in Portugal.||Aims of the study are:||To investigate the feasibility of video-recorded Transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopic evaluation of the upper airways applied during NIV titration, and to describe the upper airway responses to NIV treatment in patients with ALS.||To explore whether the endoscopic view of the upper airways will influence the titration of NIV settings in ALS patients.||To explore whether NIV titration with endoscopic evaluation will influence NIV compliance and ventilation effectiveness in ALS patients.",ALS

NCT01992029,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is an adult-onset neuro degenerative disease leading to muscle wasting, palsy and death due to respiratory failure within 3 to 5 years. The only effective drug (Riluzole) increases the life expectancy for about three months, knowing that on average, the diagnostic is given after a delay of one year in France. The identification of new biomarkers for early diagnostic is therefore of fundamental importance. This could improve the treatment efficacy but also give important clues about the prognostic, the rate of evolution and overall help identify new targets for future therapeutics. The investigators' goals are to find specific miRNA patterns expression associated to ALS in humans and use those patterns as diagnostic and prognostic tools.||miRNA are non-coding small fragments of RNA that binds mRNA and can down regulate their expression. In humans, around 700 miRNA have been so far identified. The role of miRNA in human pathology is well established in various types of cancer, but recent works have emphasize their role in neuro degenerative diseases and their expression profile can considered specific for Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington diseases. Very few data are currently available about their expression pattern in ALS. Previous studies have however shown that down regulating of some miRNA in spinal cord Moto neurons can trigger an ALS-like clinical phenotype. A more recent work on transgenic murine model SOD1 G93A has demonstrated the role of the specific miRNA206 in regulating the re-innervation processes at the neuro-muscular junction. Mi206 have the ability to promote the re-innervation process and therefore to slow the disease progression.||This research aimed to study the expression of more than 700 miRNA in four different groups (20 patients per group): ALS patients, normal control having a shoulder surgery during which they will have a muscle (deltoid) biopsy, patients explored for peripheral neuropathy with a blood sample, a lumbar puncture for CSF examination and neuro-muscular biopsy and patient explored for myopathy with a blood sample, a lumbar puncture for CSF examination and a muscular biopsy.

NCT03150290,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving motor neurons of the cerebral cortex, brain stem and spinal cord. Motor neuron loss results in rapidly progressive muscle paralysis, usually leading to death from respiratory failure in 3-5 years.||Weight loss is a frequent phenomenon and an independent negative prognostic factor for survival in ALS. Involvement of bulbar muscles with dysphagia is likely to lead to decrease in energy intake resulting in negative energy balance. However, weight loss also occurs in non-dysphagic patients, and is not restricted to reduction in skeletal muscle mass but also involves fat mass reduction.||Hypermetabolism (i.e. elevation of resting energy expenditure, REE) have been reported in ALS in about 50% of ALS patients but the origin of this hypermetabolism remains unknown. Increase of REE seems paradoxical in the context of ALS because skeletal muscle mass, which accounts for a large proportion of energy consumption and heat production, is decreased in ALS patients. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is another important organ for basal and inducible energy expenditure and thermogenesis. In humans, BAT is primarily found in infants and young children, and healthy adults has long been considered as almost devoid of functional BAT. However, a recent study using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron-emission tomographic (PET) scan showed that depots of functional BAT were present in about 5% of adult humans, most commonly localized in the cervical-supraclavicular region. In an autopsy series, depots of BAT in the periadrenal region were found in 19/20 ALS patients. It has been estimated that, if present, 50 g of maximally stimulated brown tissue could represent up to 20% of REE expenditure in an adult human. The presence of substantial, functional, depots of BAT could thus participate in the increase of REE observed in ALS patients.||The primary objective of this study is to identify and quantify potential depots of functional BAT in ALS patients. Secondary objectives will be to correlate amount of detectable BAT with measured REE, clinical parameters evaluating ALS progression and biological parameters.||This study will include 5 patients referred to the Paris ALS center with a diagnosis of ALS and ""unexplained"" (i.e. not explained by severe dysphagia) loss of 5 percent or more of normal body weight in the last 6 months. 5 ALS patients without significant weight loss will also be included in the study as controls.||For each patient, measurement of REE will be performed by indirect calorimetry. The volume and activity of BAT will be determined using 18F-FDG PET whole body scans. Data on concomitant and past disorders (including cancer and diabete mellitus), smoking history, medication use, height, current and normal body weight, age and site of onset of ALS symptoms will be recorded. Functional motor impairment will be assessed using manual muscle testing and the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale as in routine clinical practice.||This study will be the first to investigate, using non-invasive procedures, the role of depots of functional BAT in ALS patients' metabolic dysfunction.

For all patients, nutritional status will be assessed by measurement of weight, and determination of Urinary Urea Nitrogen (via 24hr urinary sample), albumin and pre-albumin levels and questions regarding recent weight changes. In addition, for ALS patients, clinical data regarding the age of the patient, duration of disease, site of onset along with ALS-FRS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale) and Pulmonary function testing will be collected. If these data are already available from chart as they are commonly performed during routine care, the data will be obtained from the patients chart.||5cc blood will be obtained for measurement of Serum albumin, pre-albumin and TNF-α. Antigenic TNF-α, bioactive TNF-α and receptors serum sTNF-RI and TNF-RII will be measured using the standard ELISA kits and cytolytic assays.||Respiratory Quotients (RQs) will be measured using a metabolic cart in both controls and ALS patients. First, the patient's VCO2 and VO2 will be measured - as the patient breaths into a mask connected to the machine.- RQ will be calculated using Lavoisier and Laplace's equation: RQ = VCO2/VO2.||This, however, is not an accurate representation because it considers only fats and carbohydrates as the sources for these gases. A corrected Non-Protein RQ (NPRQ) RQ will be calculated using a 24 hour urine sample and measuring the Urinary Urea Nitrogen (24hr UUN). This tells us the amount of protein oxidized per 24 hours. Then, applying the principle that one gram of urinary nitrogen represents the combustion of an amount of protein that requires 5.925L of oxygen and produces 4.75L of carbon dioxide, the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide associated with protein metabolism will be calculated. This calculated VO2 and VCO2 will then be subtracted from the totals measured using the metabolic cart and the corrected Non-Protein RQ will be calculated.||The corrected respiratory quotient will then be used to calculate the amount of nutritional substrate utilization in the patient population using Table 7.2.

NCT03519880,"Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an important therapy for patients with a number of neurological diseases. Specifically, for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)--a fatal, non-curable, progressive disease of the motor neurons--NIV represents one of the most effective treatments with a survival benefit of greater than 1 year. Despite this survival advantage, and the corresponding improvement in Quality of Life (QoL), compliance with NIV can be poor. Factors contributing to poor compliance to NIV include bulbar onset disease and mask leaks. In addition to reduced adherence to therapy, elevated mask leaks can compromise the pressure adjustment algorithm in average volume assured pressure support (AVAPS) ventilation, a commonly used mode of bilevel (positive airway pressure) PAP therapy in ALS. In an effort to increase NIV compliance in subjects with neurological conditions, and specifically ALS, investigators hypothesize that a better fit achieved through 3D printed NIV mask interfaces may improve utilization by decreasing mask leaks, decreasing the required delivery pressures and improving compliance with therapy. Investigators therefore propose a feasibility study to investigate the use of 3D printing to manufacture customized NIV mask interfaces for subjects with ALS who encounter difficulty using NIV because of poorly fitting mask interfaces despite exhausting available commercial mask options.",ALS

NCT03984708,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects central and peripheral motor neurons. None of the clinical trials conducted have been clearly successful and the disease remains incurable, putting patients' vital prognosis at risk in the medium term.

The causes of this hypermetabolism and the precise exploration of the metabolic pathways involved are still poorly understood. The fibroblasts of ALS patients may be the site of some metabolic disturbances in this disease with a hypothetical specific basal metabolic profile. These cells are adapted to different metabolic explorations such as omnic approaches. Superficial skin biopsy followed by fibroblast culture can provide a considerable biobank.

NCT03618966,"Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multi-factorial and multi-systemic pathology associated with motor neuron degeneration, muscle atrophy and paralysis. Mounting evidence suggests that the earliest presymptomatic functional and pathological changes are occurring distally in axons and at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). These changes precede, and can be independent of the loss of cell bodies or alterations in other cell types already linked to the ALS disease process. In line with these studies, we found that in human ALS muscles the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are less sensitive to ACh than denervated non-ALS muscles. It has been also reported that muscle specific expression of mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene induces muscle atrophy, significant reduction in muscle strength, mitochondrial dysfunction, microgliosis, and neuronal degeneration, suggesting that retrograde signals from muscle to nerve may contribute to synapse and axon damage. This suggests that skeletal muscle is an important target for therapeutic intervention. Neuromuscular system may be artificially stimulated either by an electrical stimulation (ES) or by time-varying electromagnetic fields. Neuromuscular magnetic stimulation (NMMS) has been proposed as an alternative, non-invasive, stimulation technique.||Objective: aim of the study is to verify whether neuromuscular magnetic stimulation can improve muscle function in spinal-onset Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients. We will study if neuromuscular magnetic stimulation can counteract muscle atrophy by promoting the modulation of factors associated with muscle catabolism and/or increasing the efficacy of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.||Methods: At the baseline visit, ALS patients will be randomized in two groups to receive daily real neuromuscular magnetic stimulation in one arm and sham neuromuscular magnetic stimulation in the opposite arm for two weeks. All patients will undergo median nerve conduction study and a clinical examination, including handgrip strength test and evaluation of upper limbs muscle strength by Medical Research Council Muscle Scale. At the end of the stimulation procedures, a needle muscle biopsy will be performed bilaterally from flexor carpi radialis muscle. Muscle samples will be used to perform histomorphometric and molecular analysis and electrophysiological recordings of acetylcholine evoked currents.",ALS
NCT01854294,"Background||In the early 1990s Genervon hypothesized that Central Nervous System / Peripheral Nervous systme (CNS/PNS) and rare motoneuron diseases and disorders involve the interplay of a highly complex, multifactorial process of many non-dominant effectors in an interactive dynamic network. Therefore Genervon decided for its drug development strategy the classic single target drug development paradigm is not likely leading to a cure.|Genervon also hypothesized that aging is likely the initial multifactorial triggers that lead to multiple defective or degraded gene products accumulating with advancing years. However the key to a cure for many human neurological disorders is in the subsequent common terminal cascade coinciding with the onset of neurological deficits. The terminal cascade involves the shared pathways of interactive multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms that lead to the ultimate demise of neurons. Therefore Genervon's strategy is not to find the triggers or the residue debris of neuron death in discrete areas of the central nervous system.|Genervon recognized the limited human capacity to design a drug that can dynamically and interactively modulate multiple pathways and genes. Therefore one possible drug development strategy is to find the endogenous early stage regulatory molecule(s) that controls the development, monitoring and correction of the human nervous system.|Genervon developed a novel proprietary technology platform named Protein Bands Selection by Function to find the fetal signal regulators. One of the discoveries is a 33 amino acid peptide we named human Motoneuronotrophic Factor (MNTF), its gene sequence and its chromosome location.|Genervon developed another novel platform named In Silico Analysis to find active sites within bigger proteins. Within the MNTF peptide, Genervon identified a family of nine embryonic stage human multifactorial master regulators which govern nervous system development, protection and correction. These master regulators are highly expressed in week 9 of embryonic/fetal development, a time of incredible intricacies, but truly remarkable consistency as well.|Genervon has developed one of the nine master regulators named GM6 for disease modification of CNS/PNS and neurodegenerative diseases and disorders with shared or common pathways of interactive multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms. GM6 binds to Insulin Receptor beta sub-unit and Insulin Growth Factor Receptor 1 and Receptor 2 (IGF1R/IGF2R) which also have the identical sub-unit. GM6 penetrates the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) and activates many appropriate genes through multiple pathways to induce anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative and regenerative effects in response to the dynamic distress signals from the nervous system.|GM6 is also known as GM604, GM602 and GM608. Drug name GM604 is assigned to ALS indication. GM602 is assigned to stroke indication. GM608 is assigned to Parkinson Disease indication.|The investigational drug GM604 is a regulatory/signaling peptide with a sequence identical to one of the nine active sites of human Motoneuronotrophic factor (MNTF), also referred to as GM6 in studies. MNTF is a novel human endogenous developmental stage neurotrophin for the nervous system with a specific human chromosome location.|Pre-clinical efficacy studies: The investigators' preclinical animal study has shown that intravenously injected GM604 is able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain. GM604 has shown neuroprotection in a variety of in vitro and animal models of numerous CNS diseases including ALS, ischemic stroke, spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer Disease (AD) and Huntington Disease (HD).|GM6 provided neuroprotection for neurons in vitro against soluble inflammatory factors in human CSF from patients with various CNS diseases. It increased neurons survival by 175% after exposure to ALS patients' CSF, by 191% in AD patients' CSF, by 198% in PD patients' CSF, by 205% in Stroke patients' CSF, by 246% in MS patients' CSF and by 273% in HD patients' CSF.|Preclinical research in animal models indicates GM604 to be a neuroprotective agent in animal models of ALS, motoneuron disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke. In ALS model, SOD1 mice from Jackson Lab stock #G93A were treated with GM604 at 0, 1 and 5 mg/kg. SOD1 mice were examined for age of disease onset, age of death, and behavioral expression of the disease (CS=Clinical score). GM604 prolonged life span in ALS mice SOD1 by 30% [(163.5-126)/126 = 30%], delayed median clinical score by 53%, delayed symptoms onset by 27% [(145.5-114.5)/114.5 = 27%] at 5 mg/kg dose. The conclusion is that GM6 significantly showed a dose dependent effect in delaying age of onset of the disease, age of death, increasing grip strength and rota-rod performance, and improving clinical score of the treated animals.|The investigators found out later in the study of Wobbler Mouse model that the optimal dose for SOD1 mice model should probably be 20 mg/kg and will probably see even more significant effects if 20 mg/kg were used in the SOD1 mice study.|GM604 20mg/kg dramatically increased the survival life span by 500% (6 fold from 7-14 weeks to 55-65 weeks) and the control animals and animals treated with low doses of GM6 showed a continual decrease in grip strength. Wobbler mice treated with GM6 at 10-20 mg/kg showed an improvement in grip strength out to 4 weeks (3 fold). GM604 10 and 20 mg/kg treatment showed a significant increase in body weight out to 8 weeks following treatment.GM604 10 and 20 mg/kg treatment increased of preservation of motor neurons by 160% (2.6 fold).||The conclusion is that GM604 was found to be efficacious in an in vivo mouse model of neurological disease. The effectiveness of GM604 was dose-dependent and indicates that GM604 may be beneficial in treating various neurological disorders.||Rationales||This pilot trial is designed to test proof of principle, i.e. determine if a 2-week IV bolus treatment with this agent can (1) change ALS protein expression (target biomarkers and efficacy biomarkers) after treatment (2) have preliminary effects measures of ALS disease clinical progression.|Previous human experience: A Phase 1 Clinical Trial Study has been completed. The Phase 1 Trial primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability and to establish the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of GM602 at 0.5, 1.5, and 5.0 mg/kg administered as a single bolus intravenous dose in human subjects and after 3 consecutive daily doses of GM602 at the highest safe and tolerated dose of 5.0 mg/kg.

Other rare diseases including CNS/PNS diseases and disorders are multifactorial and multisystem diseases as well, i.e. multiple interactive biologic systems and genes are compromised and failing like domino.|One of the major reasons for CNS clinical trials that have uniformly failed is that the classic drug development paradigm of designing single target drug for CNS/PNS and rare diseases' pathogenesis simply would not be able to handle the multifactorial nature of the complex diseases.|An initial trigger(s) which is likely to be multifactorial and cumulative is followed by a terminal cascade which also involves interactive multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms, coinciding with the onset of neurological deficits, genes mutation and or expression of misfolded proteins. That is simply why a single target drug is not able to do the job. Most neurological diseases and disorders have common underlying pathogenic mechanisms that lead to neural death. Our drug development strategy is to find an endogenous regulator to interactively and dynamically modulate these common underlying pathogenic mechanisms.|Genervon changed the drug development paradigm from hitting a single gene/pathway to a comprehensive and dynamic, multifactorial approach to treat complex rare and neurodegenerative diseases with a multi-factorial drug GM604. GM604 is one of the embryonic/fetal stage MNTF master regulators that is an endogenous signaling peptide for the development and regulations of the nervous system development. GM604 is multifactorial and corrects inadvertent errors in embryonic/fetal development and this neuroprotection and correction property may be applied to neurodegenerative disease therapy in adults.|Genervon studied the mechanisms of action of GM6 by DNA microarray technique. GM604 controls and modulates many known and significant ALS genes with positive effects, through multiple pathways interactively, systemically and dynamically. Our master regulator peptide drug modulates not just one but many ALS related genes. It is not a cocktail of drugs, but one master regulator peptide drug.|Mechanisms that have been postulated in ALS are a complex interplay between multiple pathogenic processes including oxidative stress, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction excitotoxicity, and impaired axonal transport. GM604 modulates genes involved in these pathways and others. Genervon has also identified some genes to be tested as targets.|ALS is notoriously fatal and has many alternate forms with different pathogenesis. Therefore all the previous single target drug trials have to restrict the enrollment to very small selective segment of ALS patients. With the potential that GM604 functions through multiple pathways and modulate multiple ALS related genes, Genervon believes GM604 can potentially treat ALS patients from a variety of segments instead of restricting to small selective segment of ALS patients. Genervon is proposing an ALS Phase 2 clinical trial that is broadly inclusive.||Use of Biomarkers for ALS||Most late-phase clinical trials across all diseases fail to demonstrate drug efficacy between case and controls. The incorporation of biomarkers within clinical trials may reduce this 'drug attrition' rate. The biomarkers to be incorporated into clinical trials can be subdivided into:||'Target' biomarkers (the drug hits its target and, therefore, provide benefit),|'Efficacy' biomarkers (indicators of positive drug effect (result) via the mechanism of drug action).|'Efficacy/Target biomarkers.||Genervon hypothesized that modulating disease causing genes may modulate ALS disease progression.",ALS
NCT00786032,"People affected by severe motor disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) need alternative methods for communication and control. They may not be able to use even the most basic conventional assistive technologies, which all rely in one way or another on muscles. For these people, communication and control technology that does not depend on neuromuscular function is essential. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can give these individuals communication and control capacity that does not depend on nerves and muscles. It has been shown that even people who are almost completely paralyzed can control sensor motor rhythms and other features of scalp-recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and that they can use this control to move a computer cursor in one or two dimensions, to select letters or icons, or even to move a robotic arm. The group is now focused on developing clinically practical BCI applications, translating them from the laboratory into people's homes, and establishing that they can have a positive impact on the lives of people with severe disabilities.||The goal of this VA demonstration project is to show that BCI technology is a clinically practical and important new communication and control option that can improve the lives of veterans with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The project will test four well-supported hypotheses: (1) that people with ALS who find (or will soon find) conventional assistive technology inadequate can and will use a BCI system for important purposes in their daily lives without close technical oversight, 2) they will continue and even increase this use throughout the period of the study, (3) that BCI use will improve their lives, and 4) BCI will improve the lives of their families and caregivers.||In accord with these hypotheses, the aims are:||Aim 1: To recruit 2-4 person teams of VA health professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, nurse- practitioners, physician's assistants, EEG technicians, therapists, rehabilitation specialists, medical researchers) at each of 5-6 participating VA centers, and train them in the use and ongoing support of the BCI home system. These teams will use the VA ALS database, local ALS Association affiliates, and VA clinics to identify and recruit at each site 3-4 patients with ALS who are not adequately served by conventional assistive technology; have stable physical and social environments; and have caregivers with basic computer skills who are willing to support BCI use. The VA teams will set up BCI systems in the patients' homes and teach them and their caregivers how to use the system on a daily basis for applications that the individual patients desire, such as e-mail, environmental control, computer-mediated conversations, word-processing, and/or entertainment. The VA teams will provide long-distance Internet-based oversight as the patients begin to use BCI technology for communication and control in their daily lives. The Project teams will be available for onsite supervision at the beginning of BCI use and for periodic in-home evaluations later on. In addition to providing ongoing oversight and guidance of the project, the group will focus on reducing the need for continued expert support (both onsite and remote) by incorporating into the BCI software adaptations and adjustments that are essential for reliable operation and by further simplifying and streamlining the caregiver interface and other aspects of system operation. The ultimate goal is a practical system that can be used by many severely disabled people in their homes with minimal ongoing technical support.||Aim 2: To assess the extent and success of BCI usage and its impact on quality of life. Via the Internet link and periodic visits, the Project teams will quantify the amount of BCI usage in both absolute terms and in terms of its importance for supporting specific functions (e.g., interactions with family, e-mail); and will quantify BCI performance in terms of accuracy and speed. In addition, standard and specialized quality-of-life measures and BCI assessment questionnaires will be used to quantitatively evaluate the long-term impact of BCI technology on the lives of the users, their caregivers, and their families. The effects of disease progression (e.g., loss of remaining neuromuscular function) on the extent and nature of BCI use will also be monitored. We expect this work to establish that the communication and control applications provided by the BCI system are heavily used by people severely disabled by ALS, that the BCI can produce lasting improvement in their lives and in the lives of those close to them, and that the BCI can even allow people who would otherwise become totally locked-in to continue to interact with their families and friends.||The success of this project will depend on establishment and maintenance of reliable high-speed daily communication between the subjects, the VA sites, and the Project team. The VA and investigators must be able to evaluate each subject's EEG data every day, 7 days/week, so that questions can be answered, problems can be solved, and system parameters can be optimized within 24 hrs.||In this study, the first primary hypothesis is that the subjects will begin to use the BCI for important purposes in their daily lives and that they will continue and even increase this use throughout the period of the study. Thus, the primary quantitative outcomes for this hypothesis will be 1) the time spent using the BCI and 2) the change in this time over the study period. If their BCI use time is substantial and remains stable or increases over the study, we will be able to conclude that the subjects have found the BCI system desirable and valuable. The second primary hypothesis is that BCI will improve the quality of life of people severely disabled by ALS. Secondary outcomes include: caregiver quality of life measures; the patient and caregiver assessments of BCI usefulness; the BCI performance (i.e., speed and accuracy); and the amount of time spent by project staff in technical support.||The completion of this study and the achievement of its aims should help to move EEG based BCI technology out of the laboratory and to demonstrate that it is a powerful, clinically practical, and affordable communication and control technology that can substantially improve the lives of people with ALS. Furthermore, the study should validate and establish an important new option, BCI-based communication that the VA can provide to many of its most severely disabled patients. This achievement would make the VA the first and only entity in the world that can provide this radically new and important assistive technology to its patients.||Forty prospective BCI Users satisfied the inclusion criteria and provided informed consent*. [*Footnote 1: Two additional people who provided informed consent were subsequently found to not satisfy the inclusion criteria.] Thirty-seven completed the BCI assessment sessions, 28 satisfied the BCI accuracy criterion, and 27 had the BCI system placed in their homes.",ALS

NCT03214224,"The specific objective of this study is to validate the practice of remote pulmonary function testing (rPFT) conducted in the home through the use of connected mobile health devices and the Penn State Hershey ALS Telemanagement program. The central hypothesis is that guided home assessment of respiratory function is a valid method for detecting respiratory insufficiency leading to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) recommendation. This study has the potential to transform the current practice of conducting breathing assessments every three months, resulting in timelier detection of respiratory insufficiency, thereby staining quality of life and lengthening survival. This protocol has the potential to demonstrate telemanagement exceeding the standards of ALS care.||This is a self-controlled study which will enroll 40 patients from the ALS clinic. On the day of their clinical visit, study participants will perform both a standard PFT as well as a simulated rPFT, both generating three valid repetitions of forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) procedures. The simulated rPFT will mimic the practice of home telemonitoring by having patients be instructed by a respiratory therapist over the telemanagement portal while in a research room within the ALS clinic. The primary hypothesis is that there is no difference in the results of PFT and rPFT for respiratory assessment of FVC and MIP.",ALS

NCT01369901,"Objective: Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), or Kennedy s disease, is a slowly progressive, X-linked motor neuron disease for which there is currently no treatment. It is caused by a mutation in the androgen receptor that results in a polyglutamine repeat expansion. The role of exercise in motor neuron disease research is debated. Although SBMA is believed to be primarily a neuronopathy, the potential effect of aberrant androgen receptor activity on muscle leads exercise to be of uncertain utility in this population. Our objective is to examine the safety and efficacy of exercise regimens in Kennedy s disease.||Study Population: We aim to enroll 80 men with genetically confirmed Kennedy s disease.||Design: This will be a randomized, evaluator blinded, trial with 25 subjects in each exercise arm. Following informed consent, the subjects will undergo an initial medical and physical evaluations followed by a series of neurological tests and blood work over a two-day outpatient visit at the NIH. The subjects will provide blood work for analysis of hormonal levels and assessment of any potential muscle damage. On the second day of their visit, the subjects will be randomized and taught a series of either functional or stretching exercises that they will engage in as part of the study and control arms, respectively. Following the baseline visit to NIH, the subjects will be monitored throughout the study with telephone contacts and other measures including video recording to monitor their progress and compliance. The subjects will return to the NIH at the end of a 12 week period at which time the physical and laboratory testing will be repeated. After the 12 week exercise period there will be a four week period where we will follow-up with the participants by telephone and e-mail. At the end of the trial all of the subjects will be informed of the study results and given the opportunity to learn the exercises if they are found to be beneficial.||Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure used will be the Adult Myopathy Assessment Tool (AMAT). Secondary outcome measures will involve quantitative muscle analysis (QMA), the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, a quality of life measure (SF-36v2TM), adverse event questionnaires, a Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP) assessment of balance, accelerometer measurements of exercise effort, and progressive height sit-to-stand testing.

NCT04257760,"Patient recruitment:||Patients who are eligible for the study will be asked by their ALS care team if they would like to speak to the research assistant about the study. Patients may also self refer if they hear about the study and are interested in learning more about it. As a part of this study, participants will meet briefly with a palliative care (PC) physician to discuss the goals of palliative care and the interventions a palliative care physician can provide. As part of the study, patients will be offered the choice of a palliative care consultation (in a timely manner - either at home or at the ALS clinic) or no palliative care consultation. Participants will fill out a brief questionnaire regarding their interest in a PC consultation. Relevant demographic information such as time since diagnosis and functional ability will be collected for all patients included in the study. This study is planned to recruit patients for the period of one year, with a total study period of 18 months (i.e. the first patient included to the study will be followed until death or for 18 months and the last patient recruited to the study will be followed for 6 months).||Outcome Measures:||All patients who agree to participate in the study, will be asked to complete two scales which measure quality of life: The ALS Specific Quality of Life Revised Scale (ALSSQOL-R,) a validated instrument to measure quality of life in ALS patients (8, 15) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a validated instrument for measuring anxiety and depression in patients and caregivers(16). These scales will be completed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and every 3 months for the entirety of the study period. Caregivers will complete the HADS at the same time interval. The ALSSQOL-R and HADS require 10-20 minutes and 2-5 minutes to complete, respectively (15, 17). The ALSSQOL-R is routinely used as pre-visit screening in multidisciplinary ALS clinics and is felt to be feasible in the ALS population(15). The invitation to the study and coordination of survey completion will be led by a research assistant and not a member of the patient's care team. Survey completion rates and feasibility of routine completion will be examined. Qualitative reasons for declining a PC consult at the time of study initiation, as reported by patients on the consent to PC consultation questionnaire, will also be recorded.||Patients and caregivers who receive a PC consult as a part of the study period will complete a questionnaire focusing on their satisfaction with the consultation, its timeliness (i.e. too early or too late in their illness trajectory) and any fatigue or distress which resulted from the consultation. Follow-up PC assessments will occur as determined by the patient and PC physician. Patients and caregivers who decline participation in the study as well as those who are included in the study but declined PC consultation will continue with usual care and thus be referred to a PC specialist at the discretion of their physicians. A detailed overview of the plan for study recruitment and planned outcome measures are outlined in Figure 1 and Table 1.||Analyses Strategy:||This study will focus on several different outcomes as listed in Table 1. The main outcome will be the effect of PC consultation on patient and caregiver quality of life. This will be determined by evaluating a change in ALSSQOL-R and HADS scores in patients and caregivers over time, both individually and between the groups of patients who received and did not receive a PC consult. Unfortunately, there are no previously reported minimally important differences for these scales in the ALS population. Difference in quality of life indicators will be examined between patients who received PC involvement and those in the usual care group. Mean quality of life scores will be compared at different time points post consultation and statistical significance will be determined using t-tests. Quality of life scores pre and post palliative care consultation will also be examined in patients and caregivers at different time points. They will be reported as mean scores (+95% confidence intervals) and significant change will be determined using univariate analyses. As this study has a focus on describing the PC needs of the ALS population, chart reviews of PC consults will be completed to identify the major themes and issues discussed in PC consults.||Process measures for this study will also be examined. These include the proportion of patients that were approached who consented to be in the study, proportion of patients in the study who choose a PC consultation, the duration of the PC consultation, the number of follow-up appointments per patient, the delay between enrollment in the study and initial PC consultation. The acceptability and satisfaction with PC involvement will be assessed by qualitative and quantitative measures including patient and caregiver self-reported reasons for accepting or declining a PC consultation and responses to post PC satisfaction questionnaire. Balancing measures and potential negative effects of PC consultation, including anxiety and fatigue, will be assessed via the post PC consultation satisfaction scale. If data allows, subsequent studies may focus on the change in health care utilization (i.e. emergency department visits, hospitalizations etc.) in the group of patients who received PC when compared to the usual care group.||Given the variability in presentation and often rapid clinical decline experienced by patients with ALS, the idea of early PC for all patients is likely not feasible and unlikely to be beneficial. Some patients may experience significant impairment and the time of diagnosis and benefit from immediate referral, while others may experience a period of stability and be comfortable without referral. Considering this, a goal of this study is understanding which factors are most likely to prompt a referral to PC, and which patients are most likely to benefit from a PC referral. As a part of the study, PC consultations and patient records will be reviewed and demographic information such as ALS Functional Rating Scale score (ALSFRS -R), time since diagnosis and the presence or absence of symptoms will be considered. This will be linked to reported quality of life scores to identify which factors are most likely to improve with PC referral and which factors are most associated the need for PC referral. This will help guide clinicians nationwide as to when to consider PC referrals in their patients, with the goal of ensuring patients have timely access to PC at the appropriate time.||Potential Impact:||Ultimately, there is immense potential to improve patient quality of life with this project. It is the first to introduce routine PC into a multi-disciplinary ALS clinic in Ontario, a population that is largely underserviced by PC. It seeks to understand the physical and emotional factors which limit patient quality of life and links to physicians and resources to act on these issues. This project also plans to improve the quality of life of caregivers, providing increased support and further understanding of caregiver needs. The investigators hope to identify the factors that make a patient/caregiver most likely to benefit from PC; which will guide referral criteria for all patients with ALS and ensure that PC consultations are available to patients at a timely manner when it is most likely to be impactful. Finally, this study will improve the capacity of current health care providers to address patient and caregiver quality of life concerns. It will provide a new foundation of knowledge on which larger, controlled studies can be built in the future.",ALS

NCT03456882,"ALS is a rare neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem and motor cortex. The only drug showing to improve survival in patients with ALS is riluzole. However, the benefits of riluzole only consist in a three-month delay of death while disability and other outcome measures are virtually unaffected. This highlights the need to test novel approaches with documented activity on markers of disease mechanisms and, at the same time, able to slow the progression of the disease.||The major determinants of motor neuron death in ALS remain to be established. Emerging evidence points to an involvement of the adaptive immune response in disease progression. RNS60 is a novel agent with immunomodulatory properties. Adding to previous reports of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities of RNS601,2,3,4, our group showed a protective effect of RNS60 on motor neurons in both in vitro and in vivo models of familial ALS carrying the SOD1G93A mutation (unpublished data). Therefore, RNS60 presents itself as a promising candidate for the treatment of ALS patients. Its exceptional safety profile, demonstrated both in preclinical toxicology studies and FDA-approved clinical phase I studies upon inhaled and IV administration, supports testing of RNS60 in clinical phase II studies in ALS.||The investigators have identified six candidate pharmacodynamic markers of RNS60 that have previously been associated with ALS: 1. T-reg (measured via FOXP3 and CD25 mRNA); 2. Cyp-A; 3. 3-NT; 4. Actin-NT; 5. MCP-1; 6. IL-17.||The investigators have measured and reported the effects on T-reg and IL172 in experimental allergic encephalitis. The investigators also have preliminary unpublished data on MCP1 in allergic asthma.||This background provides the sound rationale for a phase II, biomarker-driven, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.||Primary Objective:||1. To measure the effect of RNS60 treatment on selected pharmacodynamic biomarkers in ALS patients concurrently treated with riluzole. Candidate markers include 1. T-reg (measured via FOXP3 and CD25 mRNA); 2. Cyp-A; 3. 3-NT; 4. Actin-NT; 5. MCP-1; 6. IL-17.||Secondary Objectives:||The preliminary efficacy of RNS60 on functional disability, as measured by the ALSFRS-R scale;|The preliminary efficacy of RNS60 in prolonging survival (or time to tracheostomy, whichever comes first);|The preliminary efficacy of RNS60 in slowing the decline of forced vital capacity (FVC) from baseline;|The tolerability and safety of RNS60 through the identification of unexpected adverse events;|The impact of RNS60 on quality of life as measured by ALSAQ-40 scale.||RNS60 has been tested in three Phase I safety studies in the USA (NCT01264783, NCT01057498, and NCT01511302), and a recently completed Phase IIa (NCT02422121) study in UK. Two additional investigator initiated Phase IIa trials are currently ongoing, one at Mass General Hospital (NCT02525471), and one at the University of Zurich (with University of Innsbruck as a second site). The choice of measuring both biological and clinical markers of disease in the same study reflects the attempt to accurately capture the complete clinical impact of RNS60 treatment. If both the biomarker results and clinical measures of the study support the purported efficacy of the drug, a follow-up study (or studies) will be designed to confirm the efficacy of RNS60 in a larger patient population. It is also possible that this study may result in promising biomarker findings but null clinical findings. If this were the case, more dose-finding work would be necessary before ruling out a possible clinical effect. Conversely, positive clinical findings accompanied by negative biomarker findings may necessitate the identification of new biomarkers of target engagement to further guide the drug development process.",ALS

NCT03076632,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) result in a mixture of destroyed, damaged, and spared neural circuits. Activating spared nerve circuits augments neural transmission.||With this goal in mind, the investigators recently developed a novel method of cervical electrical stimulation (CES) to noninvasively activate arm and hand muscles. The investigators are conducting a pilot clinical study (NCT02469675) to establish CES safety in subjects with cervical SCI, ALS, and non-disabled volunteers. To date, 19 subjects have undergone >120 CES sessions without major safety or tolerability issues.||The current study is designed to gain further mechanistic insight. In Aim 1, the investigators will test in more detail how CES (traveling through spinal and peripheral circuits) interacts with individual pulses of TMS (traveling through corticospinal circuits). In Aim 2, the investigators will further test CES's therapeutic potential by combining stimulation with simultaneous physical exercises. In Aim 3, the investigators will compare the acute effects on synaptic transmission of passive stimulation to stimulation triggered by the subject's own muscle activity.||Please note, this is a preliminary study. This study is testing for temporary changes in nerve transmission to hand muscles. There is no expectation of long-term benefit from this study. If the investigators see temporary changes in this study, then future studies would focus on how to prolong that effect.",ALS

NCT00244244,"Arimoclomol is a small molecule that upregulates ""molecular chaperones"" in cells under stress. Arimoclomol extends survival by five weeks when given both pre-symptomatically and at disease onset in a mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1) transgenic mouse model of ALS. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects in other rat models of nerve damage. Molecular chaperone proteins are critical in the cellular response to stress and protein misfolding. Recent data suggest that the SOD1 mutation responsible for ALS in some patients with familial disease reduces the availability of a variety of molecular chaperones, and thus weakens their ability to respond to cellular stress. Protein misfolding and consequent aggregation may play a role in the pathogenesis of both the familial and sporadic forms of ALS. Therapeutic agents such as arimoclomol that improve cellular chaperone response to protein misfolding may be helpful in ALS.",ALS
NCT02464852,"Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is neurodegenerative disorder that leads to progressive weakness of limb, bulbar and respiratory muscles. The most common form of the disease is the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Severe weakness of the neck extensor muscles is common in patients with ALS. Those patients are advised to wear a cervical collar, to improve their neck posture and social interaction. However the main limit of commercially available collars is that they are designed to immobilize the neck, which makes them uncomfortable and strenuous to wear for long time. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects on MND patients of a new collar specifically designed for people affected by neck weakness: the Sheffield Support Snood. The assessment will be performed through the use of inertial sensors since they allow the measurement to be performed in real life settings (clinics/home) with reduced discomfort to the patient. Subjects will be asked to perform a series of active head movements (flexion, extension, axial rotation, lateral bending) with and without the collar and the range of movement measured in the two cases will be used to assess the support offered by the collar. Since in MND patients difficulty in perform active head movements is due to a severe weakness of the extensor muscles, with or without involvement of the neck flexors, this study will also investigate the activation of these muscles while the subject is performing the active head movements. A wireless surface electromyographic system (sEMG) will be used to this purpose. Patients able to perform a series of activities of daily living (ADL, ie: drinking, eating, washing hands) will be asked to perform the tasks both with and without the collar. The support perceived by the subjects while they are performing the ADL will be evaluated through a questionnaire specifically developed for this study.",ALS
NCT02118727,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects 30,000 Americans each year. Of these 30,000 Americans, it has been suggested that up to 50% will experience cognitive and behavioral changes in the form of frontotemporal dysfunction and up to 40% will meet criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Riluzole the only FDA approved agent for ALS extends a patient's lifespan by 2-3 months, and there are no proven therapies for the cognitive changes associated with ALS. More effective therapy for this universally fatal disease is desperately needed.||Results from an open label pilot trial of 20 patients treated with memantine at 10 mg BID suggested that treatment with the combination of memantine and riluzole slowed ALS disease progression. This trial also showed that levels of specific protein biomarkers in the CSF at baseline correlated with the rate of disease progression. A concurrent phase II study performed by Dr Carvalho, found no effect with similar dosing; however, the study was limited in terms of power. Comments on previous failed drug trials in ALS have raised the concern that many ALS trials study a potential therapeutic agent at only a single dose and thus may miss the potential efficacy of non FDA approved doses; therefore, this proposed study will test a higher dose of memantine, 20 mg BID, in a double blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial of 90 patients with ALS to determine if a therapy of memantine, especially in combination with riluzole, can slow disease progression compared to treatment with riluzole alone or no treatment. The primary outcome measure will be the rate of disease progression as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale- Revised (ALSFRS-R). In addition the investigators will examine the cognitive deficits seen in ALS patients measured by the ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Finally the investigators will examine specific validated protein serum biomarkers to determine if there is a correlation between the levels of these biomarkers and the rate of disease progression. In particular the investigators will measure the ratio of phosphorylated heavy neurofilament to Complement 3 to see if this ratio is predictive of disease progression and if the levels change during therapy with memantine.||This project will offer unique insights into this untreatable disease. If this study confirms earlier results and suggests that memantine, when used in conjunction with riluzole, significantly slows down the progression of the disease, as well as ameliorates cognitive deficits in patients with fronto-temporal dysfunction, it will set the groundwork for conducting a larger phase III trial.",ALS
NCT04654689,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common neurodegenerative disease of an inflammatory nature among those affecting motor neurons, with a life expectancy of 3 to 5 years. It is characterised by the loss of motor neurons, and can be of the bulbar type when the pathology begins to affect the motor neurons located in the spinal bulb, or of the medullary type when it begins with a loss of strength and weakness in the extremities. Both types eventually lead to an affectation of both motor neurons that results in progressive paralysis of the voluntary muscles until the patient dies. In addition, the pathology presents cognitive and behavioural alterations. Specifically, deficits have been described in verbal fluency, memory, emotional processing or social cognition, which appear to be mainly associated with hypoperfusion of the prefrontal area or hypometabolism.||Pathogenically, ALS is characterised by an alteration in mitochondrial energy use at a neuronal level, mainly linked to a lower activity of the enzymes of the electron transport chain in the spinal cord. This alteration is a consequence of loss of oxidative control, excessive generation of oxidative free radicals, accumulation of neurofilaments, and excitotoxicity linked to an increase in the neurotransmitter glutamate.||In this respect, it has been suggested that bacterial dysbiosis, related to cognitive and behavioural worsening, could also contribute to this adverse neuroinflammatory state, having been associated with a greater risk of suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically in ALS, a variation in intestinal microbial composition has recently been observed, with an increased abundance of E. coli and enterobacteria, and a low abundance of total yeast, in patients suffering from ALS; and lower levels of non-butyrate producing bacteria needed to maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier, immune competition and energy metabolism. In contrast, increased Akkermansia muciniphila has been associated with higher levels of nicotinamide and improved disease symptoms in the animal model of the disease.||This evidence, associated with the lack of medical treatment to cure the disease, makes it necessary to look for new therapeutic alternatives of a non-pharmacological nature. These include the administration of effective antioxidants, which reverse the high oxidative stress and inflammation characteristic of the disease. This type of treatment (specifically the association of the antioxidants Pterostilbene and Nicotinamide riboside) has already been applied by our research group to patients with ALS, achieving significant clinical improvements such as: greater functional capacity, greater respiratory capacity, increased muscle strength and electrical activity in the upper and lower limbs, as well as an increase in the percentage of skeletal muscle associated with fat loss. In this sense, several polyphenols have also been tested in animal models, among which the activity shown by Resveratrol stands out, with a high antioxidant power and great neuroprotective capacity, which is associated with an increase in the expression and activation of SIRT1 and AMPK in the ventral part of the spinal cord after its administration. Both mediators promoted the normalization of autophage flow and, more importantly, increased mitochondrial biogenesis in SOD1-G93A mice. However, their beneficial effects are strongly limited by their low availability. This limitation can be overcome by administering Resveratrol and its natural analogues, incorporated in liposomes or nanoparticles, as this is the best option for guaranteeing stability and bioavailability, after administration and absorption of the antioxidant.||Moreover, the effects of the polyphenol Curcumin have already been studied in ALS. In a paper by Chico et al, its effects were studied in ALS patients at doses of 600mg/day for 6 months. In this study they found that Curcumin generated a slight slowdown in the progression of the disease, improving aerobic metabolism and oxidative damage. Furthermore, the use of nanobiotechnology with Curcumin (80mg/day) in the treatment of ALS patients obtained positive results showing that nanocurcumin is safe and could improve the probability of survival as an additional treatment in these patients, especially those with existing bulbar symptoms. In short, the use of both antioxidants in liposome form improves the bioavailability and effects of both, and their liposome combination has already been successfully tested in vivo in prostate cancer patients.||These anti-ALS effects of the two molecules could be complemented by their action in improving the microbiota. To obtain the bioactive products of Curcumin, biotransformation by the human intestinal microflora is necessary; in a bidirectional manner, it has been demonstrated that Curcumin has beneficial effects on the intestinal microbiota by increasing the number of bacterial families such as: Prevotellaceae, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacilli, Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae, and reducing the number of pro-inflammatory bacterial families such as: Enterobacteria and Enterococci. With regard to Resveratrol, as occurs with Curcumin, the intestinal microflora contributes to its metabolism; and also stands out in the increased production of anti-inflammatory bacteria of the Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium genera. In addition, it has been found to increase levels of the bacterium Akkermansia Muciniphila, which is associated with an improvement in the prognosis of the disease.||Finally, the use of these two antioxidants in ALS would be combined synergistically by repositioning Dutasteride, a drug selected after a molecular topology scan of more than 30,000 drugs from two databases: CMC and Drugbank. It is currently marketed for the treatment of different pathologies, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia. According to the in silico studies based on Molecular Topology carried out by Dr. Gálvez's team, a very promising anti-ALS effect has been identified for Dutasteride, linked to the TDP-43 RNA mediator, among others. Drug design using molecular topology consists of applying topological descriptors to identify and describe, using a specific mathematical pattern, molecules and/or drugs related to a specific disease, in this case ALS. Using molecules with proven anti-ALS activity (Edaravone and Riluzole) and the TDP-43 RNA mediator, this mathematical pattern was identified and the databases mentioned above were traced with the aim of identifying drugs that share the same pattern and therefore have potential anti-ALS activity. In addition, considering the current shortage of effective treatments for ALS, other mathematical patterns related to anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective and analgesic activity were taken into account when selecting the Dutasteride candidate. To date, molecular topology has enabled the identification of new treatments for CNS diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer and very recently SARS-Cov-2, among others.",ALS
NCT02675075,"In 2008, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's Disease became a presumptively compensable (service connected) disease as the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee stated an association between the development of ALS and military service. According to the IOM report, military service increases life risk of ALS by 1.5 fold. There are approximately 4,200 Veterans with ALS and roughly 1,000 new cases each year. At the Tampa VA, since 2007, there has been a consistent rise in the number of Veterans diagnosed and treated with ALS.||Most physiological assessments that are commonly used to determine the functional status of patients with ALS require trained clinical personnel to administer and interpret the results. The investigators propose to use automatic speech understanding and machine learning software (DESIPHER) to: identify speech pathologies and use them to predict other aspects of physiological degeneration associated with ALS (e.g., respiratory difficulty or inability to swallow), and ultimately improve speech recognition for those with speech impairments. The investigators expect this to improve the ability to appropriately identify and intervene when Veterans with ALS are at risk of serious adverse medical issues such as respiratory failure and aspiration. The investigators postulate that analyzing the overall divergence of (impaired) speech, from a ""normal"" baseline, will prove to be more robust and a better marker for involvement than others that have been proposed.||Specific research questions to be addressed by this study are: (1) Is it possible to train a speech recognition system to adapt to increasingly more frequent language/speech errors of particular types, to produce an accurate textual transcript that would be readable by an ALS patient's caregiver or physician? (2) Are specific changes in physiological functioning: Forced Vital Capacity, tongue strength, speech velocity, weight (loss), aspiration risk, or psychological distress, reflected in different types of language/speech errors associated with ALS?||By understanding how speech functioning correlates with the degree to which other biophysical functioning has degraded, it is possible to apply a new, non-invasive measure for assessing the functionality of an ALS patient. In addition, the features associated with speech degradation it is possible to adapt existing speech recognition software to a patient's speech as it evolves over time, so that the quality of life for patients may be improved through conversation with a computer.||Respiratory failure is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in ALS patients. The investigators expect that the method of analyzing speech will present an excellent biomarker for respiratory function, as there is an expected increase in pauses during speech due to the necessity of increased frequency of respirations, a decrease in loudness, and decreased overall velocity of speech. A second major cause of death is aspiration. As the articular muscles decline, the investigators expect to note a decrease in the clarity of speech. Speech involvement often precedes swallowing involvement in ALS; thus, the investigators expect that increasing ""speech divergence"" will indicate potential aspiration risk.",ALS

NCT00071435,"Objective: Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) is a clinical syndrome of progressive spasticity. Patients with PLS have slow voluntary movements. In PLS, degeneration of corticospinal tracts disrupts the communication between the motor cortex and motor neurons. Normally, voluntary movements are preceded by EEG waveform changes that begin before the movement occurs. These waveforms are called movement related cortical potentials (MRCPs). The first part of the MRCP represents neural activity in the motor cortex. The goal of this study is to determine whether the motor cortex and pre-motor cortex operate normally to generate these intrinsic signals for voluntary movement in patients with PLS.||Study population: Patients with PLS of at least 3 years duration with slow finger tapping movements will be studied. Patients must fulfill the clinical criteria for the ascending subtype of PLS. They must also have a loss of corticospinal excitability as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Age matched normal volunteers will be studied as a control group.||Design: Patients and normal volunteers will undergo a session of EEG recording while making slow finger tapping movements. They will have an MRI of the brain, for the purpose of localizing dipole positions of the MRCP components.||Outcome parameters: The peak amplitudes of components of the MRCPs will be compared between patients and a healthy control group as the primary outcome measure.

NCT03604822,"ALS clinical presentation and pathophysiology||Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a group of rapidly progressive fatal neurological diseases involving the brain and spinal cord. Clinical presentation is phenotypically heterogeneous and depends on the type of onset. The pathophysiology mechanisms behind ALS are not clear and may include oxidative stress, protein misfolding and aggregation, skeletal muscle dysfunction, glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis. Whilst in the past ALS was considered distinctly a disorder of the motor system, current evidence suggests that some cognitive (ALSci) or behavioural (ALSbi) impairment occurs in up to 50% of cases, and co-morbid dementia (ALS-FTD) occurs in approximately 14% of patients with a new diagnosis of ALS. The notion that ""pure"" ALS and ""pure"" FTD may present two extremes of one disease continuum is reinforced by identification of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) as a major pathological substrate underlying both diseases. Emotional lability (pseudobulbar affect), a symptom frequently correlated with bulbar involvement in ALS, may also be confusing and disruptive, especially when communicating with those who are not aware of the nature of the problem.||Music therapy potential in multidisciplinary model of ALS care||Considering the multiple and complex needs of people with ALS (PALS), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) guideline [NG42] suggests coordinated care using a clinic based, specialist ALS multidisciplinary team approach.

Multidisciplinary ALS care has been shown to increase survival of people with PALS and to improve their mental QoL.||More rehabilitation options have to be considered for PALS, enabling them to reach their fullest potential, delaying the disease progression and prolonging lifespan. Music therapy (MT) is the clinical use of music and its elements to accomplish individualized health goals within a therapeutic relationship. Music engages vast network of regions located in both hemispheres of the brain and shares processing components with other functions, such as those involved in language, movement, reasoning and experiencing emotions. Application of MT principles in neurorehabilitation allow to treat cognitive, sensory, and motor dysfunctions. Professionally trained music therapists are well equipped to provide symptomatic care for people with neurodegenerative diseases, adapting to increasing and changing disability of each patient as the disease progresses, whilst maintaining and developing trusting therapeutic relationship established early in the disease course. Albeit currently underused, MT could be one of the modalities of supportive rehabilitation in ALS.||Research on clinical MT applications for ALS is scarce and presents significant challenges due to heterogeneity of ALS clinical presentation and progression, poor scientific understanding of the disease mechanisms and the ethical issues of research involving terminally ill people. It has been suggested that MT could contribute to interdisciplinary ALS care. There is anecdotal evidence that MT increases mind-body connection, reduces distressing physical symptoms such as dyspnoea and pain, and associated feelings of loneliness, anxiety and sadness for patients with advanced ALS, is ""pleasant and restorative"" for PALS with tracheostomy and their families , and provides families affected by ALS with opportunities for shared meaningful activities. The first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of music therapy effect on people living with ALS found that active MT increased communication, improved QoL and decreased the physical symptoms of the disease for people with ALS during hospital stay. Music-assisted relaxation may be a useful strategy to optimize noninvasive ventilation (NIV) experience for people with ALS.||It may be concluded that, firstly, in most cases, MT is available for PALS at the end of life, when natural communication and motor functions are lost or limited, that music therapists are normally not included into multidisciplinary model of ALS care and that the predominant type of music intervention being used for treatment is music listening. Secondly, little research has been done to understand the effects of MT interventions conducted with patients at earlier stages of ALS and no published research addressing the use of MT techniques for neurorehabilitation (e.g. supporting motor, cognitive, respiratory, swallowing, speech functions) of PALS has been found.||Role of exercise in ALS treatment||Prior to recently the exercise has been discouraged for people with ALS, the recommendation based on the assumption that exercise can lead to muscle fatigue and, hence, increase patient's disability. This assumption however is not supported by scientific evidence, whilst, to the contrary, there is evidence that physical inactivity secondary to ALS may lead to cardiovascular deconditioning, disuse weakness and consequential muscle atrophy. Existing literature reviews support evidence for moderate exercise in ALS, whilst highlighting importance of supervised, individualized training programs. Cochrane review concluded there was no solid evidence to deem exercise in ALS beneficial or harmful and emphasized the need for further research. Recent data suggests that exercise may be beneficial for cellular and morphological adaptations in motor neuron function and thus may help to maintain motor function. Finally, preliminary results of a new RCT suggest that strictly monitored exercise programs reduce motor deterioration in ALS. Thus, in current clinical practice regular moderate exercise is encouraged for people with ALS to prolong mobility and independence.||MT for management of bulbar and respiratory symptoms in ALS||Even more so than in case of the general physical exercise, there is lasting controversy in regards to the role of exercise in management of bulbar and respiratory ALS symptoms. 93% of people with ALS experience speech impairments and 85% present with swallowing dysfunction at some point during the disease progression. Loss of natural communication is regarded by the patients as one of the worst aspects of the disease. Respiratory failure has been cited as the leading cause of death, and weakening of the respiratory function and adherence to NIV as the leading causes of anxiety of people with ALS. Patients with dysphagia reported social isolation, fear and decreased mental health. Dysphagia and malnutrition contribute to 25.9% of ALS mortality and increase the risk of death by 7.7 times. Aspiration pneumonia and dehydration have also been cited among the leading factors contributing to mortality in ALS.||Although there is lack of evidence supporting the use of strengthening exercises for improving speech in patients with ALS, there is no evidence of such exercises being harmful. Respiratory training may have positive effect on respiratory and swallowing functions of people with ALS. Whilst physical and psycho-emotional needs of people with ALS that MT can potentially attend to are many and varied, literature overview and empirical evidence suggest that researching the role of individualized, carefully monitored MT program to support respiratory and bulbar functions of people with ALS currently constitute the highest priority as these functions directly affect survival.||Study aim and significance||Applied MT research in multidisciplinary clinical context allows to systematically look at bulbar and respiratory functions support in ALS, which is important to do, since swallowing, vocalization and breathing are tightly coordinated, and close relationship exists between these processes, in terms of location and activation of the neurons.||This study intends to determine feasibility of a MT protocol as intervention to support respiration, cough, swallowing and speech functions of persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (PALS). Since MT constitutes a new treatment modality for bulbar and respiratory dysfunction in ALS, the study is focused primarily on safety and tolerability of the treatment protocol.||Music therapy treatment protocol||Upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons deterioration in ALS results in dysarthria and dysphagia of spastic-flaccid type, although actual presentation varies in each patient and changes with the disease progression. Generally, lower motor neurone (LMN) involvement, characteristic of bulbar onset, leads to flaccid presentation, whilst degeneration of upper motor neurone (UMN), characteristic of spinal onset, results in spasticity of bulbar muscles. Muscle relaxation and moderate exercise, as well as learning efficient breathing and voice production techniques, voice care techniques and ALS-specific communication strategies may be helpful, rather than rigorous strengthening oral motor exercises. The protocol serves the following primary therapy objectives:||to increase breath support,|to increase muscle relaxation,|to increase speech rate,|to prevent / decrease hypernasality,|to maintain swallowing coordination.||ALS-specific, individualized MT protocol was delivered to study participants in their homes twice weekly for the duration of six weeks by the researcher, who is a board certified music therapist and neurologic music therapist, with experience of working with this patient group and in this setting. Facilitating music structures have been composed by the researcher to support cueing, timing and intensity of breathing and vocalization exercises. These structures were regularly modified to suit the unique capabilities, current individual demands and progress of each participant. One familiar song, selected by the participant, was used for each participant in therapeutic singing exercise closing each session.||Data collection||Assessing bulbar dysfunction in ALS presents additional challenge to a researcher, as the existing tools may be not sensitive enough to reliably measure the change, given that ALS is a rapidly degenerating disease and that the rate of deterioration varies greatly from patient to patient. An array of subjective and objective measurements for bulbar and respiratory changes are used, including standard respiratory tools (FVC, MIP, MEP, PCF), videofluoroscopic swallow study, visual analogue scales for ease of speech and respiration, machine analysis of recorded vocal samples, semi-structured interviews and session descriptions, to explore the feasibility of systematic bulbar and respiratory assessment in ALS for future research.",ALS

Studies demonstrate that the immune system plays a key role in ALS progression; however, the role of the immune system is unclear, as various aspects can play both a beneficial and detrimental role in the disease course. Attempts to universally suppress the immune system in ALS patients have at best had negligible effects on progression or at worst accelerated the disease. Alternatively, augmenting or depleting specific immune cell populations in ALS mouse models alters the disease course and slows progression. Thus, there is a critical need to identify immune cell populations to serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.||Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of ALS in both human patients and mouse models. While clinical symptoms result from motor neuron degeneration, it is becoming increasingly clear that the immune system plays a key role in pathology. A variety of insults give rise to identical immune responses which go on to produce the characteristic clinical and histopathological manifestations of motor neuron disease. This makes the immune system an attractive target for therapeutics, as the wide variety of potential ALS sources all funnel through a common immunological pathway over the course of disease. The investigators recent studies have demonstrated that ALS patients have increased levels of several subpopulations of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in their peripheral blood. A subset of patients has ILC levels 5-10 times greater than those found in healthy control patients. The differences seen in the ILC levels in peripheral blood are much greater differences seen in other immune cell populations during ALS. Thus, these cell populations are attractive candidates for use as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.||The proposed study can be broken into three broad phases which will applicable to each patient: recruitment, sample collection, and analysis. Following diagnosis of disease, ALS patients who live within 1 hour of the University of Michigan will be called by our clinical coordinator and enrolled in the study (recruitment). Following enrollment in the study, each of the patients will be visited once every 28 ± 5 days for a year after the initial visit by a Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research (MICHR) clinical research unit; this unit will take 20 ml of blood per patient. Samples will then be returned to the University of Michigan. ILCs will be isolated from peripheral blood using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and the mRNA of each ILC population will be collected and cytokine production analyzed using multiplex (analysis). On the day of collection, a clinician or clinical coordinator from the University of Michigan Comprehensive ALS Clinic (UMCAC) will contact the patient to complete an ALSFRS-R questionnaire to assess the physical deterioration of the patients.||The study will also incorporate control subjects. The control subjects will have blood taken once a month for 12 total visits over 36 months, but will not complete the ALSFRS-R questionnaire as they will not have been diagnosed with ALS and therefore the questionnaire does not fit; 20ml of blood will be taken per visit.||Subjects need to live within approximately 60 miles of the University of Michigan.",ALS
NCT00011154,"The principal objective of this study is to identify environmental and/or genetic risk factors for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We are addressing this objective by conducting a case-control study of ALS in the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program (KPMCP). Over a four-year period, approximately 175 persons newly diagnosed with ALS will be identified and recruited through physician referrals and computerized mechanisms available within the Kaiser system. The patients with ALS will be compared to a sample of 350 age- and gender-matched persons without ALS from the same membership. Specific study aims are as follows: (1) to investigate the association of ALS with exposure to neurotoxicants including lead, other heavy metals, solvents and pesticides; (2) to determine whether inadequate oxidative defenses for protecting against free-radicals enhance the toxicity of exogenous exposures; (3) to examine the evidence for familial aggregation of neurodegenerative diseases among first-degree relatives of patients with ALS; and (4) to estimate the incidence of ALS in diverse racial and ethnic groups.",ALS
NCT03296501,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable disease of unknown etiology that in a short time leads to significant impairment of motor functions and death. The frequency of ALS is 4-8/100 000. Mostly it affects people between 40 and 70 years old, but it can occur at a younger age. Since the symptom onset is most frequently in the fifth or sixth decade, ALS is a huge economic burden for the society. There are many studies conducted to treat the disease and prevent it, but currently the medicine offers only one drug that can slow the appearance of disease symptoms but could not stop the progression. Yet, improvements in medical management, including nutrition and breathing, regularly increase patient survival - 50% of affected patients live at least 3 or more years after diagnosis; 20% live 5 years or more; and up to 10% will survive more than 10 years. The stem-cell-based therapies could be therefore a new waited strategy for ALS clinical treatment.||Since the clinical course of ALS may vary substantially between patients, we are planning to qualify them with a primarily established clinical course based on a detailed anamnesis and clinical assessment. The goal of our nonrandomized, open label study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal regenerative cells (ADRC) transplantation into the individuals with diagnosed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In order to select a group of 30 ALS patients for the ADRC treatment, approximately 50 ALS patients will be examined. All patients enrolled will have a documented at least 3-months clinical and electrophisiological observation of ALS disease course prior to study enrollment. Each patient will recive 3 injections of ADRC every 3 months: an intraspinal injection followed by 2 subsequent intrathecal infusions. Safety, adverse events and efficacy will be confirmed by clinical, elecrophisiological ( EMG, MUNIX), neuroimmaging and spirometry together with functional (ALSFRS-R) and objective motor assesment (MRC and dynamometer).",ALS

NCT01835782,"Previous studies into the Guamian ALS-Parkinson's Dementia complex has identified β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), as a potential neurotoxin responsible for this disease. BMAA is a non-essential amino acid and is produced by a cyanobacterium which is present in all ecosystems. Subsequently several groups have identified high concentrations of BMAA in brain tissues of patients from North America and Europe with several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Diseases. It has been hypothesized that chronic intake of BMAA in the diet leads to mis-incorporation of the amino acid into brain proteins, where it produces slow neuronal damage and recent evidence has shown that BMAA is mis-incorporated into proteins in neuronal cell lines via seryl tRNA synthetase, thereby producing protein mis-folding and protein aggregates, leading to cell death. It has been demonstrated in mammalian neuronal cell cultures that exogenous L-serine could prevent the BMAA neurotoxin from being mis-incorporated into proteins, thereby preventing cell death and that very high doses of L-serine may compete with the transport of a number of non-essential amino acids across the blood-brain barrier via the y+ transporter. These findings have led us to believe that high doses of L-serine could possibly stop the mis-incorporation of BMAA into brain proteins which in turn would slow or even abate the progression of ALS. This study will determine the safety of different doses of L-serine given to ALS subjects at 0.5 gm twice daily (BID), 2.5gm BID, 7.5g BID or 15 grams BID for six months.",ALS
NCT00331812,"In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), malnutrition is frequent (16 to 50 % of the patients) and is an independent prognostic factor. One of the implicated factors is the increase of resting energy expenditure (REE) which can be found in about 50 % of ALS patients. The origin of this hypermetabolism is currently unknown but could be located in the mitochondria. In fact, some studies have found mitochondrial abnormalities and the existence of an oxidative stress. Thus, the aim of this study is to characterize the mitochondrial abnormalities and the oxidant/antioxidant status of ALS patients and to determine their relationship with the metabolic status, hypermetabolism or normometabolism. Three groups of patients will be studied : 20 hypermetabolic ALS patients, 20 normometabolic ALS patients and 20 healthy volunteers paired for age and sex.",ALS

NCT00377351,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare but rapidly progressive neurological disease that often results in death within a few years after the diagnosis. The incidence of ALS in the US is approximately 2.0/100,000/year and is age dependent. Very few epidemiological studies have investigated the causes of ALS. Last year, Dr. Alberto Ascherio at Harvard School of Public Health successfully obtained a RO1 grant to investigate the risk of ALS by documenting ALS cases in five well-established large prospective cohorts: The Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort (CPS IIN), the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), and the NIH-American Association of Retired Persons Diet and Health Study (AARP-DH). The primary aims of this grant are to prospectively clarify the associations between diet and smoking and risk of ALS in this to date the largest epidemiological study on ALS. Incident ALS cases will be documented via biennial questionnaires in the first three cohorts. While mortality data will be obtained in the MEC and AARP-DH cohorts by searching the National Death Index (NDI) Plus, it is also desirable to identify surviving incident cases in these two cohorts.||The objective of this specific proposal is to ascertain the self-reported incident ALS cases from the AARP-DH study and obtain consent for medical release following the procedures set up for Parkinson's disease (PD) cases in the currently approved Parkinson's Genes and Environment (PAGE) Study IRB approval #06-E-N093.

NCT03411863,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) reduces connections between the cortical motor neurons that initiate movement and the spinal motor neurons that direct muscles to execute movement. This situation shares many key features with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Accumulating evidence in SCI suggests that externally activating spared nerve circuits with electromagnetic stimulation augments neural transmission.||With this goal, the investigators developed a novel method of noninvasive cervical electrical stimulation (CES). CES activates multiple muscles on both upper limbs by triggering afferent sensory or efferent motor nerve roots depending on stimulus intensity. This study will investigate CES for its potential to strengthen residual circuits to the hands in ALS.||To the investigators' knowledge, electrical spinal stimulation for ALS has never been tested or applied previously. Therefore, a pilot study is essential. This study will be performed in two stages:||Map CES circuit and synaptic targets: The experiments share a common structure comprising conditioning and test stimuli delivered at a range of intensities, sites, and interstimulus intervals.|Determine parameters for combining CES with volitional movement: volitional limb movements depend on the same corticospinal and motor neuron circuits as those activated by TMS and F-waves. Since preliminary data shows that subthreshold CES facilitates TMS responses, CES may also be able to facilitate volitional limb movements.||Successful completion of these experiments will: mechanistically elucidate CES circuit interactions; investigate the potential for CES to enhance concurrent volitional muscle activation; and establish CES as safe and feasible in the ALS population. Given the limited treatment options for ALS, any amount of progress would represent a meaningful step forward. Moreover, results of this pilot study could lead to direct translation for lasting clinical benefit by combining repetitive subthreshold CES with repetitive task-oriented physical exercise training in subsequent studies. CES would be compatible with other interventions, including medications and cell-based treatments.",ALS

Furthermore, in addition to C9ORF72, there are many other gene mutations that can cause ALS. This study will not test these other genes, and therefore a negative test result for the C9ORF72 mutation will not exclude the possibility that you have a heritable form of ALS.||In order to understand the natural history of C9ORF72 related ALS in terms of measures of rate of progression, the investigators need to understand how the size of the hexanucleotide repeat expansion influences disease parameters.

NCT01874808,"Compared to other movement disorders, such as Parkinson Disease (PD), the mechanisms of movement impairment in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) have not been a focus of great interest. It is at least partly related to the classical assumption that impairment of movement in ALS simply reflects a dysfunction of the final motor pathways. However, the concept that ALS purely involves upper and lower motor neuron has been definitively challenged. Accumulating evidence for the concept that ALS is a multisystem degenerative disease is supported by histological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies. Clinically, lower limb stiffness is associated with extrapyramidal rigidity and postural instability in 69% of ALS patients. These latter may also display abnormalities of movement initiation impairing walking, such as gait initiation failure, usually reported in PD patients. All these data support the hypothesis that some balance troubles in ALS patients may result from an additional dysfunction and/or lesion of the basal ganglia circuitry and/or of its output structures, such as the cortex or the midbrain.||In PD patients, which represent a model of basal ganglia system dysfunction, length and velocity of the first step during gait initiation are known to be reduced and improved by dopaminergic therapy whereas postural instability is less sensitive to the treatment suggesting the involvement of other brain structures dysfunction and/or lesion. One way to evaluate the postural control during the gait initiation process is to measure the vertical velocity of the centre of gravity by using a force platform. In healthy adults, during the single support phase, a forward fall of the centre of gravity occurs and is actively reversed by the stance leg soleus muscle activation prior foot contact. In parkinsonian patients with postural instability, this phenomenon, called active braking, is altered. It is assumed that this postural instability results from additional lesions and/or dysfunction in the basal ganglia output structures, especially in the midbrain, containing the pedunculopontine nucleus and the mesencephalic locomotor region, two structures known to participate to the control of locomotion and posture in animals.||This research program will focus on gait initiation and postural control in ALS patients, by comparing patients with vs without postural instability (but also in comparison to controls), by using a multidisciplinary approach which combines neurophysiological and neuroimaging analyses.||After clinical evaluation, two groups of ALS patients, defined upon the feature of postural instability, and one group of healthy subjects (n=25 for each group of patients and 20 for healthy subjects) will be included in the study.||The neurophysiological evaluation will be performed through a gait initiation assessment, which will alow us to collect biomechanical and electromyographical data, such as the braking index.||The neuroradiological evaluation will include first an fMRI analysis. A study of specific circuits in networks will be performed which will provide the first description of neural network dynamics associated with the preparation and execution of movement in ALS patients.||If the investigators get a deeper understanding of the neural substrates underlying the hypothetical impairment of gait initiation and postural control, the investigators will then be able to develop adequate therapeutical strategies (pharmacological interventions, surgical therapies, rehabilitation programs) aimed at improving movement preparation and gait execution in ALS patients",ALS
NCT01811355,"Background:||Many ALS patients suffer from painful muscle cramps, but unfortunately we do not have any medication proven to help muscle cramps in ALS. Reducing the pain caused by cramps - which can be debilitating - could help people living with ALS.||Muscle cramps are sudden, painful, and involuntary contractions of a muscle. They are caused by nerve dysfunction. When we examine nerves and muscles electrically, we see cramps as bursts of high-frequency (up to150 Hz) firing of the motor nerve cells. Cramps in ALS are believed to be the result of an increase of persistent sodium currents in the sick lower motor nerve cells.||A medication called Quinine was for many years the commonly used drug for controlling cramps in ALS, but the FDA has advised against its use for cramps because of its potential risks (e.g., death). Today there is no agreement on how to treat cramps in the ALS. The American Academy of Neurology recently encouraged further studies of the treatment of muscle cramps and suggested lidocaine as one of a few drugs of special interest.||Mexiletine:||Mexiletine is a medication closely related to lidocaine that can be taken by mouth (instead of being injected). Mexiletine stops the type of sodium currents that are thought to cause muscle cramps. Mexiletine is a relatively older medication that has been extensively studied in humans. It has been shown to reduce the electrical measures of muscle cramps for other disease conditions. For example, in patients with another severe nerve disease - Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3) - mexiletine treatment led to a decrease in the average number of muscle cramps from 24 to 3 cramps per month.. The safety profile of mexiletine is good, with the most frequent side effects being nausea or other abdominal symptoms. These side effects are rare at the doses (300 mg/day) used in this study. In patients with normal heart function, mexiletine has a minimal effect on heart rhythm. In previous clinical trials, no subject developed any serious heart rate problem.||Experimental Plan:||Using multiple sites within the State of California we will quickly enroll a small number (N=30) of ALS patients with severe muscle cramps. The study is a double-blinded, placebo controlled (i.e., the investigator and the participant does not know if the pills contain mexiletine or placebo), crossover (all subjects receive two weeks of mexiletine and two weeks of placebo) study.||After a one week run in, participants will be evaluated on their ability to fill out the cramp diary. Participants who filled out their diary will be randomly assigned to either mexiletine or placebo for their first two weeks. For the first three days of each 2-week period, one 150mg capsule will be taken at bed time. For day 4 to 14 one capsule twice per day will be taken. Each treatment period will be 2 weeks with an intervening 1 week washout period - for a total study length of 6 weeks. Safety will be monitored with liver function studies and EKG's.",ALS

The median survival after disease onset is approximately 3-4 years.||While there are now two FDA-approved agents for patients with ALS, there are no interventions that have had a meaningful impact on the natural course of this disease. Riluzole prolongs survival by up to 12 weeks. Edaravone improves some aspects of neurological function in a small subset of patients, but that was ineffective in clinical studies that included ALS patients at all stages of disease.||Past failures to identify effective therapies reflect the complexity of ALS pathogenesis, in that no single therapeutic target has been identified. Thus, single agent or dual combination therapies are unlikely to succeed. Given the truly rapid and devastating nature of ALS and that there are no effective treatments for ALS, one can argue that it is critical to devise a different approach. Until the exact mechanisms that lead to ALS are identified, it is necessary to employ polytherapy which includes new agents that show promise.||This study will lay further groundwork on methodology for performing more definite trials in ALS. The study of secondary biomarkers in ALS is significant because there are currently no molecular or biochemical biomarkers for assessing therapeutic efficacy of drug treatments in ALS clinical trials. By doing this study, the study investigators hope to learn that high-dose anti-oxidants would be a simple, low risk, low-cost approach to significantly slow or stop the progression of ALS, for which currently no effective treatment exists. Participation in this research will last about 13 months",ALS
NCT03975608,"Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is inevitably fatal. To be diagnosed with a terminal illness such as ALS deeply affects one's personal existence and goes along with significant changes regarding the physical, emotional, and social domains of the patients' life. ALS patients have to face a rapidly debilitating physical decline which restrains mobility and impairs all activities of daily living. In addition, they are confronted with their own mortality. This progressive loss of autonomy and fears about the future may lead to a sense of hopelessness and loss of quality of life, which in turn may even result in thoughts about physician-assisted suicide.||Concrete aims: Given the high emotional strain in this patient group, this study aims to apply a manualized psychotherapeutic intervention to relieve distress and promote psychological well-being on ALS patients. This short-term intervention (up to six sessions) was originally developed for advanced cancer patients. ""Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM)"" focuses on the four dimensions: (i) symptom management and communication with healthcare providers, (ii) changes in self and relations with close others, (iii) spirituality, sense of meaning and purpose and (iv) thinking of the future, hope, and mortality.||Methodology: For these aims mentioned above, the investigators will conduct a feasibility study, i.e., a pilot study before a future randomized controlled trial can be planned in detail. The design of this pilot intervention will be a non-randomised prospective non-controlled before-and-after study, in which observations will be made only in a patient group (n = 5) that receives the intervention (IG). No control group will be recruited. Assessments will be conducted on the three measurement points: before the therapy (T0), after the intervention (T1) and 3 months after the intervention (T2).This study is intended to test out the standard operating procedures, evaluate the feasibility, acceptance and adherence to the study protocol as well as preliminary efficacy of the intervention.||Recruitment: Patients will be consecutively recruited in the Clinic of Neurology at the University Medical Center of Leipzig.||Duration: The duration for patients will be about 9 months (6 months intervention, 3 month-follow-up assessment). The duration of the whole study will be 12 months.",ALS

It is primarily cross sectional in nature; longitudinal collections have been associated with a limited set of clinical and functional assessments. The investigators goal is to continue to build this repository with the collection protocol proposed here, to associate biofluid collection with specific measures of upper and lower motor neuron function. This project will compliment others to upgrade the NEALS biorepository infrastructure, including updating the computer systems, expanding the number of sample freezers and establishing a repository in the Western United States, and strengthening the standard operating procedures for the repository. The project also supports existing efforts to expand the biorepository by collecting new blood and spinal fluid samples from people with ALS.||Study Design This is a multicenter, non interventional, longitudinal study in patients with ALS. There will be four (4) subject visits in this study: Baseline, month 6, month 12, and month 18. At each visit, subjects will have biofluids collected, and be evaluated with assessment tools that focus on upper and lower motor neuron burden as well as cognitive function.||Study Objectives and Endpoints The primary objective of the study is to obtain deep phenotyping information on patients studied at regular intervals over 18 months, in conjunction with biofluid collection over that same time period.||The secondary objective of the study is to integrate data from this study to other ongoing projects via the NEALS biorepository, and future collections now being planned.||Endpoints for the study are:||Motor unit number estimation will be performed on upper extremity muscles using the multipoint incremental technique (MIMUNE);|Vital capacity, measured using slow vital capacity (SVC).|Lower motor neuron excitability will be assessed with threshold tracking nerve conduction studies (ttNCS) in the least affected intrinsic hand muscle.|Cognitive abnormalities will be assessed using the ALS Cognitive Behavior Screen (ALS-CBS);|Upper motor neuron burden will be assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), employing a paired pulse protocol and recording from the least affected upper extremity intrinsic hand muscle;|Hand held dynamometry (HHD) will be performed on 10 muscle groups tested bilaterally;|Global function (ALSFRS-R); and|Vital capacity, measured using slow vital capacity (SVC).||At each visit, blood will be collected and banked for biomarker discovery; CSF will be collected at baseline, month 6, and at month 18.||Other exploratory objectives of the study (to be performed at Barrow Neurological Institute only) will investigate to the composition of the ""pellet"" of processed CSF and a novel imaging marker called MRI cytography.||Study Locations Approximately 10 Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) Centers in the US will participate in the study.

NCT02469675,"Most neurological injuries such as spinal cord injuries (SCI) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) spare a portion of nerve circuitry. Strengthening spared nerve circuits represents a critical method to improve functional recovery. Different forms of magnetic and electrical stimulation have been used to activate brain, spinal cord, nerve, or muscle tissue. Although in some cases, surgically implanted electrical stimulation has delivered tremendous benefit, a non-invasive approach to nerve stimulation is preferable.||In this proposed study, the investigators aim to use non-invasive magnetic and electrical stimulation to strengthen motor circuits between the brain and hands. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be combined with either electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist; or electrical transcutaneous stimulation of the cervical spinal cord. Magnetic and electrical stimulation will be precisely timed so that the pulses arrive at the target spinal motor neurons at roughly the same time - this precise timing is responsible for the phenomenon of ""spike timing-dependent plasticity"".||Three groups of participants will be studied: individuals with chronic incomplete cervical SCI (n=12), individuals with definite or probable ALS (n=6), and individuals without neurological injury or disease (n=12). Subjects with SCI or ALS will have one screening visit to confirm eligibility for the study. All subjects will then undergo one baseline testing session followed by 7 sessions of unpaired or paired magnetic and electrical stimulation. Functional and physiological testing will be conducted prior to each stimulation session, then at 0, 15, 30, and 90 minutes post each session.

Mitochondria are organelles within each cell that are sometimes called ""powerhouses of the cell"" because cellular energy metabolism is located within the mitochondria.||Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a mitochondrial cofactor known for its antioxidant properties, has prolonged survival in the mouse model of ALS and has slowed functional decline in another neurodegenerative disorder, Parkinson's disease. The goals of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-dose comparison phase II study are to obtain preliminary efficacy data and to select the preferred dose for a larger phase III study.||Participants were randomly assigned to CoQ10 (at two different dose levels) or placebo in the first stage, then the 2,700 mg dose was selected in the second stage. Duration of the trial was 9 months with a total of 7 visits.",ALS
NCT03449212,"Background: Novel targeted therapeutic strategies are being developed for genetic subsets of ALS, such as those caused by dominantly inherited mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1). Investigators have developed an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inhibitor of SOD1 biosynthesis for ALS patients who carry mutations in SOD1. This ASO is now ready for clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT02623699). The initial success of the ASO will depend on showing a pharmacodynamics result on SOD1 in participants, and thus a key challenge in applying this targeted therapy involves rigorous examination of pharmacodynamics markers.||The Investigator's previous data suggest that SOD1 in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) will be an excellent pharmacodynamics marker for an SOD1-focused therapeutic approach. However, one of the central missing components in understanding SOD1 as a marker is SOD1 CSF half-life data. The half-life of this protein will aid in clinical trial planning since half-life influences the amount of SOD1 protein reduction by ASO and thus dictates the optimal timing of drug administration and CSF collection for pharmacodynamics measures.||Objectives:||Enroll a total of 86 ALS participants|Determine the kinetics for total SOD1 protein, as well as the wild type and mutant protein separately|Determine this in patients with known SOD1 mutation as well as sporadic ALS patients Eligibility|Adults over age 18|fALS with confirmed genetic testing showing a mutation in the SOD1 gene; asymptomatic SOD1 gene carriers and sporadic ALS patients.||Measures: The key outcome of this study is to determine the half-life of the SOD1 protein in symptomatic and asymptomatic ALS patients which will provide critical information to inform future therapeutic studies in ALS. For ALS patients, The Investigators will also perform Slow Vital Capacity testing and the ALSFRS-R at the screening visit and at each lumbar puncture visit.||Measures: Participants will have up to 7 in-person visits over 4 months. The study involves labeling or marking SOD1 with a special type of leucine. Leucine is an essential amino acid that is found in the foods we eat. This method involves an overnight stay for a 16 hour intravenous infusion of labeled leucine along with a collection blood and urine followed by 5 lumbar punctures scheduled over the period of 4 months.||At each subsequent visit, subjects will undergo a blood draw, urine collection, lumbar puncture, a questionnaire (ALS Functional Rating Scale) which measures motor function, and a breathing test to determine Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) measurements.||Analysis: In addition to determining the half-life of the SOD1 protein in ALS patients, the Investigators will also analyze the kinetics of wild type SOD1 protein separately from mutant SOD1 protein to determine differences in half life. The Investigators will also compare CSF Tau half-life between ALS patients and controls as a disease specificity control. The Investigators hope to correlate this data with clinical measures which may reveal other important hypotheses regarding SOD1 kinetic rates and disease manifestations.",ALS

NCT03883581,"Although advances in the management of bulbar dysfunction in ALS have been disappointing, recent interest has surfaced regarding the therapeutic potential of a pharmaceutical agent, Nuedexta (dextromethorphan HBr and quinidine sulfate), for the treatment of bulbar symptomology in individuals with ALS. Although Nuedexta received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to target symptoms of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) in ALS; anecdotal reports of improvements in speech, salivation or swallowing were reported from Neurologists treating ALS individuals who were administered Nuedexta. Subsequently, a Phase II clinical trial was conducted that reported improvements in speech, swallowing and salivation following 30-days of Nuedexta treatment. One serious limitation of this study, however, is the fact that the primary outcome employed was a perceptual patient-report scale (PRO) (Center for Neurological Study Bulbar Function Scale, CNS-BFS), with no objective physiologic outcomes to confirm actual change in bulbar physiology. The absence of any objective clinical physiologic outcomes is particularly important when examining effects of Nuedexta, given that it contains selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or serotonergic antidepressants, that can impact the regulation of emotional expression, feelings of wellbeing and modulation of depression (all known to impact the response an individual will provide on a PRO measure). Furthermore, findings based on PRO's must be validated with studies that utilize objective physiologic outcomes of speech and swallowing function. Great excitement exists regarding the potential impact of Nuedexta on bulbar function in ALS with many neurologists prescribing Nuedexta to treat these symptoms in ALS patients. To date, however; no data exists to examine and determine the physiologic impact of Nuedexta on speech or swallowing physiology. These data are needed in order to validate the initial patient-reported outcomes of the Phase II clinical trial and to provide evidence-based guidance to the management of bulbar dysfunction in ALS.",ALS

NCT03095989,"Quality of Life in people with ALS is not related to physical function, but is related to psychological, existential, and support factors. ALS caregivers demonstrate considerable burden and low QOL. It has been proposed by the investigators that it is time for the ALS field to develop ""best practices"" that use psychological intervention to improve QOL, reducing psychological distress in people with ALS and their caregivers. A disease that is as inexorably progressive and physically devastating as ALS also inevitably has an immense psychological impact on caregivers, both at the time of diagnosis and throughout the course of the disease. Yet, there is scant research on psychological interventions for ALS patients and caregivers.||Over 35 years of research demonstrate that mindfulness-based interventions comprise some of the most promising behavioral treatments in QOL improvement for people with chronic disorders.This work is based on socio-cognitive aspects of mindfulness, conceptualized as having a flexible state of mind that incorporates active engagement in the present and being sensitive to context and perspective. In over 35 years of research it has been shown that a higher state of mindfulness correlates with an improved QOL. In addition, mindfulness may lead to an improvement in some physiological as well as psychological measures. The literature on mindfulness in other disorders, combined with preliminary data on mindfulness in ALS patients and their caregivers, provides a strong evidence-based platform for proposing a careful study of the effects of mindfulness on psychological and physiological measures of ALS patients and their caregivers. The investigators conducted an exploratory investigation on a large sample (100+) of people with ALS about the influence of mindfulness on QOL and the course of the disease. The investigators found that mindfulness predicted positive QOL and psychological well-being, reducing anxiety and depression. That was quite expected. However, another finding was that mindfulness positively influenced the changes in physical symptoms: subjects with higher mindfulness experienced a slower progression of the disease, as measured by the self- administered ALS Functional Rating Scale (SA-ALSFRS). Furthermore, mindfulness was a significant predictor of positive QOL and psychological well-being in ALS caregivers, with a protective effect against anxiety and depression.||Fifty (50) participants with ALS, together with each subject's primary caregiver (i.e., an expected overall sample of 100 subjects), will be directly recruited from the Hershey Medical Center ALS Clinic at Penn State University. Participants will sign IRS-approved informed consent documents. Both patients and caregivers may be recruited even if a component of the dyad (patient-caregiver) opts not to join the study (i.e. patients and caregivers alone may be recruited). ALS patient-caregiver couples will be considered as a single subject for randomisation purposes (meaning that both the patient and the caregiver are randomly allocated to the same group). Subjects will be randomized into two groups (employing true randomization from atmospheric noise, www.random.org): an intervention group and a control group. Subjects in the intervention group will participate in the online mindfulness program, in addition to standard clinical care.||The intervention for each patient-caregiver pair will commence immediately after recruitment, on a rolling basis. Participants from the control group will be placed on a waiting list and will receive the standard care that they would receive if not in the study. Participants from both groups will be assessed 4 times: at recruitment (T1, baseline); after completing the intervention, or 5 weeks after recruitment for the control group (T2, post- treatment); three months after recruitment (T3); six months after recruitment (T4).||The primary outcome measure will be QOL (assessed with the ALS-Specific Quality of Life-Revised instrument, the ALSSQOL-R) in ALS subjects. Secondary outcomes from ALS subjects will be: depression and anxiety (assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), attained mindfulness level (assessed with the Langer Mindfulness Scale) functional, cognitive and respiratory variables, assessed respectively with the Self-Administered ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, the Edinburgh Cognitive Assessment and Forced Vital Capacity. Caregivers outcomes, considered as secondary outcomes, will be QOL (assessed with the Short Form-36), depression and anxiety (assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), care burden (assessed with the Zarit Burden Inventory) and mindfulness (assessed with the Langer Mindfulness Scale). A sub-sample of the subjects from the intervention group may be invited to a semi-structured interview about the experience with the treatment.||After the last assessment, subjects in the control group will have the option to enter the mindfulness program.

NCT03868345,"Cognitive dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a core feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). With appropriate testing, up to 50% of ALS patients will show evidence of frontotemporal dysfunction. Approximately 15% of patients meet formal criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Certain genetic forms of ALS (e.g., mutations in C9orf72) have even higher incidences of FTD. The presence of cognitive abnormalities is an adverse risk factor for survival, and its presence influences the ability of patients to cooperate in clinical trials. However, screening for frontotemporal abnormalities is frequently not performed in ALS clinics, and tools for diagnosing cognitive dysfunction are either time consuming or insensitive. Additionally, the frequently co-existing dysarthria complicates the assessment and may mask more subtle cognitive deficits. Once identified, ways of following progressive decline are also lacking. In an ongoing study, it has been shown that a sophisticated suite of speech and language analytics, developed by two of the investigators, can identify abnormalities in cognitively normal ALS patients without speech symptoms, and predict important functional changes outside of the speech domain. In this study, investigators will evaluate both speech and language in 50 patients with ALS both with and without symptoms of cognitive decline. This evaluation will be paired with two cognitive screening tools frequently used in ALS clinics, the ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The investigators will evaluate the extent to which speech and language deficits precede abnormalities as measured by the above tools and determine whether cognitive change can be accurately followed over 12 months using speech and language measures. It is hypothesized that speech and language measures will accurately and sensitively predict cognitive changes. If so, such measures may be very useful in future studies of potential therapeutic agents for ALS-FTD and other dementias.",ALS
NCT00211224,"Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) often present as akinetic-rigid syndromes and in the early stages are difficult to differentiate in the clinic. Current Consensus Diagnostic Criteria based on retrospective studies have high specificity but low sensitivity. The NNIPPS study is an EU-funded multinational (France, UK, Germany) multi-centre academic-led project with four main aims. The first aim is to test the hypothesis that riluzole, which may have generic neuroprotective properties, reduces the risk of death and improves function and quality of life (QL) in patients with MSA and PSP- 'parkinson's plus syndromes'. The second aim is to identify prognostic factors for survival and functional deterioration, and to develop and validate functional rating scales prospectively. The third aim is to investigate MRI, cognitive, pathological and genetic aspects of these disorders in relation to disease progression and pathogenesis. The fourth aim is to understand the impact of these diseases on the QL of patients and carers and to identify the health costs of treatment.||The study is designed as a randomised, stratified, controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of riluzole (up to 200mg daily) versus placebo in MSA and PSP. The primary outcome measure is survival at 36 months. Power calculations suggested that we would need to recruit ~400 patients into each stratum (MSA, PSP) in order to detect a reduction in the relative risk (RR) of death at 36 months with 80% power and two-sided a=0.05. Using modified consensus criteria (to provide greater sensitivity) we recruited 766 patients (363 PSP, 404 MSA) over 2 years (1999-2001). The first patients recruited are about to enter the open-label study. The final analysis of the primary efficacy measure is planned for December 2005. Secondary outcome measures include safety, rate of change in UPDRS and other rating scales including a parkinson's plus symtoms rating scale (PPSS), changes in cognitive function assessed using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, the Frontal Assessment Battery, The Bushke Selective Reminding Test, The Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and other tests of memory and executive function.

NCT00375050,"Schizophrenia is perhaps one of the most debilitating illnesses. Over the past years there has been limited improvement in the efficacy of the medications used to treat this disorder. In particular, the currently available antipsychotic drugs have small efficacy against negative symptoms and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. This is critical considering that both negative symptoms and cognitive deficits contribute significantly to social and vocational impairment in schizophrenic patients. Furthermore, current treatment can not always provide satisfactory control of positive symptoms. While various extracellular neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, 5HT, GABA, etc. ) have been explored as targets for antipsychotic treatment, a substantial body of evidence suggests that neurodegenerative intracellular processes might be responsible for some of the symptoms of schizophrenia, resulting in cytopathic effects or inadequate cellular functioning. Some of these processes may be triggered by excitotoxic influence of neurotransmitters (i.e. glutamate). As many neuroleptic agents currently in use have some neuroprotective properties it is possible to speculate that medications with primarily neuroprotective mode of action might be of additional help in treatment of schizophrenia.||Huntington's disease patients who in its advanced form exhibit some symptoms similar to that of psychotic illness, have, in a recent small (n=9) open label study with a neuroprotective drug riluzole, shown a temporary improvement in not only motor function, but also cognitive, and behavioral functioning (Seppi 2001).||Based on all of the above, it seems possible to expect improvement in symptoms of schizophrenia with neuroprotective agents such as riluzole.||Riluzole is the only effective medication approved for use in ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease) which is one of the most severe and rapidly progressing neurodegenerative illnesses that affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. A subset of ALS is inherited and involves more than 70 different mutations in the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) thereby contributing to reduced antioxidative defense against oxidative injury. This results in increased reactive oxygen species level in several organs/tissues while the bulk of symptomatology is related to degeneration in the subset of CNS neurons. Although riluzole is effective in both humans and the transgenic mouse model of familial ALS where it slows decrease in motor power, its exact neuroprotective mechanism of action is not known. Various studies suggest that riluzole might exert some of its beneficial effect by inhibition of glutamate release, inhibition of voltage-gated Na+ channels, but also intracellularly by inhibiting of protein kinase C (PKC), enzyme that was linked to oxidative neuronal injury. Although riluzole is generally well tolerated, side effects can occur and are mostly related to gastrointestinal problems, hepatotoxicity and asthenia.||This 14 week study would evaluate the benefits of riluzole add-on treatment to patients with schizophrenia on neuroleptics with refractory symptoms.",ALS

NCT01583205,"ALS is a rare, devastating, fatal neurodegenerative disease of largely unknown cause. Average survival after diagnosis is about 3 years. The diagnostic process is often protracted, but even though the possibility of ALS may have been mentioned earlier, when the diagnosis is confirmed, patients and family members are often shocked and overwhelmed.||After the diagnostic visit, patients (and accompanying family member) are commonly scheduled to return to the clinic or office in 3 to 6 months. At this first routine clinic visit, the focus is generally on assessment and management of mobility issues, diet, occupational adjustments, advance planning directives, insurance coverage and other pressing issues that usually take up the allotted time. Thus, there is often little opportunity to address the emotional impact of the diagnosis at that visit.||Our goal is a manualized intervention suitable for telephone or Skype delivery, for the management of distress and enhancement of coping skills among recently diagnosed ALS patients and/or their family care partner. We are adapting the intervention developed by Chesney, Folkman and colleagues, ""Coping Effectiveness Training,"" as being the most salient and theoretically powerful design for our purpose. We base our work on Folkman's revised model that incorporates meaning-focused coping and the importance of positive emotions, in addition to the original model of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping. The course of ALS entails progressive losses, of mobility, fine and gross motor skills, speech, swallowing, and respiration. Each requires recalibrating emotional response and coping with new challenges. Early intervention to strengthen coping skills may equip patients and care partners to handle new challenges as they arise, although in this initial study we will not follow patients long enough to observe long-term effects, if present.

NCT00054704,"The treatments for acute unipolar depression have been extensively researched. However, despite the availability of a wide range of antidepressant drugs, clinical trials indicate that 30% to 40% of depressed patients fail to respond to first-line antidepressant treatment, despite adequate dosage, duration, and compliance. Very few studies have examined the efficacy of somatic treatments for the acute phase of bipolar depression. Thus, there is a clear need to develop novel and improved therapeutics for bipolar depression. Recent preclinical studies suggest that antidepressants may exert delayed indirect effects on the glutamatergic system. Clinical data suggests that lamotrigine an inhibitor of glutamate release and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine may have antidepressant effects. Finally, our group recently found in two separate studies that the glutamate modulating agent riluzole was effective in treatment-resistant unipolar and bipolar depression (Zarate et al 2004). Together, these data suggest that the glutamatergic system may play a role in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression, and that agents, which more directly reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission, may represent a novel class of antidepressants.||In this study, we propose to extend our findings from open-label studies with riluzole in treatment-resistant depression by investigating its efficacy in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in bipolar depression.||Patients, ages 18 to 70 years with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder I or II current episode depressed (without psychotic features), will be randomized to double-blind treated to receive either riluzole (50-200 mg/day) or placebo for a period of 8 weeks.

OCD is common with lifetime prevalence estimated at 2.5%, equally affecting both genders and all ethnic groups. It is also typically chronic in nature, resulting in substantial impact on quality of life. Functioning can be markedly impaired; it has been estimated that 20% of individuals with OCD should be considered severely affected. Although the pathophysiology is unclear, hyperactivity in the prefrontal orbital cortex has been consistently demonstrated, and normalizes with treatment. A decrease in cortical inhibition has been implicated in OCD utilizing a variety of methods, including paired-pulse TMS.||First-line treatment typically consists of either cognitive-behavioural therapy and/or pharmacotherapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's or clomipramine). Ordinarily only modest benefits are obtained with conventional pharmacotherapy, with the majority of patients considered nonresponsive or only partially responsive. The limited success of conventional treatment makes identifying alternative treatments a priority. Although psychosurgery is regarded as a valid alternative for severe and refractory individuals, the potential for serious and irreversible adverse consequences is significant, rendering this a treatment of 'last resort' only. Repetitive TMS appears to represent a safe and effective alternative for severe sufferers.||Repetitive TMS has been shown to be an effective therapeutic tool for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders including MDD and schizophrenia, but investigations into its utility in OCD are very preliminary. In a study of 12 OCD patients single session stimulation of the right lateral prefrontal cortex (20 Hz, 80% motor threshold, for 20 minutes) resulted in a decrease in compulsive urges for eight hours in contrast to the left prefrontal cortex which was associated with more modest response . Sachdev et al randomly assigned 12 individuals to receive right or left dorsolateral prefrontal stimulation (10 Hz,110% resting motor threshold, 15 minutes 5 sessions/week for 2 weeks). Subjects showed significant improvement at two weeks and 1-month follow-up, regardless of lateralit. A randomized controlled trial comparing right prefrontal stimulation to sham treatment in 18 OCD subjects was negative, however low frequency (1 Hz) stimulation was used in contrast to previous reports (110% motor threshold, 20 minutes 3 times/week for 6 weeks). Most recently a small study of 10 individuals with OCD and/or Tourette's syndrome found benefit with low-frequency stimulation of the supplementary motor area (1 Hz, 100% motor threshold, 20 minutes 5 sessions/week for 2 weeks). Notably subjects were treatment-resistant in both this and the Sachdev study. Thus although this limited literature precludes any definitive conclusions, it suggests that rTMS may be of benefit in refractory OCD.||In this study we propose to investigate the effectiveness of rTMS treatment in refractory OCD. Although ideal treatment parameters need to be established, the above literature suggests that high frequency stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is likely to be beneficial. Bilateral stimulation will be used; our previous work has demonstrated this method to be safe and well tolerated. Moreover patients will be assigned in randomized double-blind fashion to receive either active or sham TMS, allowing for more definitive conclusions to be drawn. We also propose to explore whether the induction of CI mediates the therapeutic effects of rTMS on OCD symptoms.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT04215549,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD) is one of relatively common mental disorders with a prevalence of 1.63% in China.

NCT00864123,"Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven efficacy for treatment of pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet, CBT does not help all children and those who benefit often remain symptomatic upon treatment completion. The behavioral theory that underlies CBT is based on two components, namely fear conditioning and extinction. On a neural level, CBT incorporates similar mechanisms to those involved in fear conditioning. Antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptor, which is involved in learning and memory, block both fear learning and extinction. Evidence suggests that D-Cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at the NMDA glutamate receptor, augments associative learning and extinction as a form of learning in animals and humans. Recent clinical trials in adults with other anxiety disorders (acrophobia and social phobia) provided support for DCS dosing as facilitating associative learning that occurs during exposure-based psychotherapy. Given that CBT is based on the principles of extinction, DCS may augment CBT in youth with OCD, an anxiety disorder that is conceptually similar to acrophobia. With this in mind, I propose to undertake a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled pilot study of DCS to determine whether it had any short-term clinical benefits on CBT in youth with OCD. Forty children and adolescents (ages 8-17) with a primary diagnosis of OCD will be screened and, should they meet relevant criteria, randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: (1) CBT plus DCS (25 or 50mg depending on weight), or (2) CBT plus placebo. All patients will receive 10 sessions of CBT based on the protocol used in POTS (2004). Participants will take DCS or placebo 1 hour prior to each therapy session. A blinded, independent evaluator will assess participants at 3 separate time points. Two of the assessments (Baseline, Post-treatment) will be comprehensive in nature (e.g., diagnostic interview, self-reports, CY-BOCS, laboratory tests), whereas one midpoint assessment will involve administration of CY-BOCS, CGI, CGI-S, and Adverse Symptom Checklist only. Results from this study may have powerful clinical implications by providing preliminary support for pharmalogical agents that enhance the effectiveness of standard E/RP. Such agents may have utility in improving outcome, reducing premature therapy termination, and targeting patients who have been treatment refractory.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00881465,"Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective intervention for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many people do receive CBT initially due, in part, to the lack of trained providers and geographic barriers (e.g., distance to such providers). Rather, the majority of youth with OCD receive psychiatric medication alone or together with unproven forms of psychotherapy. While some serotonergic medications have demonstrated utility in pediatric OCD, side effects can be common, response rates are modest at best, and symptom remission is rare. Given this, alternative ways of providing CBT need to be identified and tested to increase the number of people with access to this form of treatment. With this in mind, the proposed study examines the efficacy of a videophone based cognitive-behavioral intervention for youth with OCD. A total of 30 youth will be randomly assigned to either videophone administered CBT or an abbreviated wait-list control arm. Cognitive-behavioral therapy will be based on a demonstrated effective treatment protocol, and adapted for videophone administration. Comprehensive assessments will be conducted by trained clinicians at relevant time-points (e.g., baseline, post-treatment, follow-up) to assess symptom severity and impairment. Should supporting data be found, videophone-administered CBT would have the potential to help many more families who would otherwise remain untreated or inadequately treated. On a societal level, evaluation and dissemination of telehealth interventions such as this will lessen costs related to sustained treatment and OCD related impairment.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00632229,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common, chronic, and oftentimes disabling disorder. The only established first-line treatments for OCD are a specific form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and the Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SRIs). Few patients with OCD experience complete symptom resolution with either modality. Even after two consecutive adequate SRI trials, as many as 30%-40% of patients fail to derive a satisfactory response. Pharmacological options for these SRI-resistant cases include switching to a different antidepressant, increasing the dose of SRI, or augmentation with another agent.||Among the pharmacological augmentation strategies, adjunctive antipsychotic medications enjoy the most empirical support as well as wide-scale use in clinical practice. Utilizing IMS Health's National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI) for 12 months ending in November 2004, 4.2% of antipsychotic medication use is for anxiety and 1.3% specifically for OCD. Conversely, for OCD patients, antipsychotic medications account for 8.6% of drug use (IMS Health NDTI MAT, 2004). Among pediatric patients, prescriptions of antipsychotics increased from 8.6 out of 1,000 U.S. children in 1995-1996 to 39.4 out of 1,000 children in 2001-2002 (Cooper et al., 2006). Similarly, Medco, a private insurance company, noted that the rate of children 19 years and under covered by private insurance with at least one atypical prescription jumped 80% from 2001 to 2005 - from 3.6 per 1,000 to 6.5 per 1,000 (USA Today, extracted 5/2/2006). These rates parallel our own research, in which approximately 35% of adult patients on psychotropics were taking an antipsychotic in addition to their SRI. Thus, clearly there is a large sample of OCD patients that are being prescribed atypical antipsychotics to augment other treatments.||Previous studies showed that approximately 33-50% of OCD patients who have not had an adequate response to SRI medication had a positive response when an atypical antipsychotic medication was added (Bloch et al., 2006). Risperidone has been the most studied agent and has the most consistently positive findings (e.g., McDougle et al., 2000). However, the problematic acute and long-term side effects of risperidone (and other atypicals) are of concern and, at times, limit their use. Paliperidone, a metabolite of risperidone that utilizes OROS osmotic drug-release technology, has a number of advantages over risperidone including a lack of drug x drug interactions and a predictable pharmacokinetic profile that is associated with better tolerability. Thus, paliperidone has the potential to be a safer alternative for augmentation in OCD patients pending supporting efficacy data. Given the need to examine the efficacy of paliperidone, this protocol is designed to determine whether paliperidone augmentation of an SRI is effective relative to a placebo-control, and safe/tolerable in patients with OCD who have not adequately responded to past adequate SRI treatment.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT01349231,"Roughly one-third of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) fail to experience significant clinical benefit from first-line interventions such as pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Antipsychotic augmentation is the only pharmacological strategy for treatment-refractory OCD with demonstrated efficacy in multiple double-blind trials (2). Antipsychotic augmentation only benefits around 1 in 3 treatment-refractory OCD. Furthermore, OCD patients typically experience the full treatment benefits of first-line interventions only after a time-lag of two to three months. Failure of symptom relief and delay of symptom relief from first-line treatments are sources of substantial morbidity and decreased quality of life in OCD patients.||Converging lines of evidence from neuroimaging, genetic and pharmacological studies support the importance of glutamate abnormalities in the pathogenesis of OCD. In Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy studies elevated concentrations of glutamate and related compounds have been demonstrated in the caudate nucleus and orbitofrontal cortex of OCD patients compared to normal controls. In genetic studies, single nucleotide polymorphisms within the glutamate transporter gene SLC1A1 have been associated with the diagnosis of OCD. Open-label, pharmacological treatment studies have suggested that glutamate modulating agents such as riluzole, n-acetylcysteine and memantine may be effective in the treatment of OCD.||Ketamine is a potent antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a major type of glutamate receptor in the brain. In a placebo-controlled study completed at Yale a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg, intravenously) had rapid antidepressant effects in depressed patients. In these subjects ketamine infusion produced mild psychotomimetic symptoms and euphoria that dissipated within 120 minutes, while the antidepressant effects of ketamine infusion emerged over the first 180 minutes and persisted over 72 hours. Fifty percent of depressed patients receiving ketamine were treatment responders at Day 3 compared to 12.5% in the placebo infusion group.

NCT02601677,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by obsessions (persistent thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive ritualistic behaviour).

However, the electrode designs between the groups varied and in some cases the stimulation area was extended to the adjacent ventral striatal regions including the nucleus accumbens (NAC).||Cortical-striate-thalami-cortical (CSTC) circuits are supported to be implicated in the pathogenesis underlying OCD caused by a failure of inhibition of the ventral striatum.

NCT02114918,"In this proposal, we aim to translate basic findings from research on cognitive biases in anxiety into a novel computerized intervention for child OCD. The treatment is designed to target a basic cognitive vulnerability in OCD, namely the selective processing of threatening OCD-related information. Briefly, the computerized procedure involves repeatedly redirecting participants' attention away from OCD-relevant threat cues in order to induce selective processing of neutral (non-threat) stimuli. This study is an initial step towards demonstrating the efficacy of a potentially highly transportable and accessible intervention for OCD. Furthermore, the project will also examine neurocognitive performance before and after attention modification to elucidate possible predictors and mechanisms of treatment response.||Aim 1: To examine the preliminary efficacy of a 12-session computerized attention modification program (AMP) on attention bias and symptom severity in children with OCD.||Hypothesis 1a: AMP treatment compared to the attention control condition (ACC) will be associated with a decrease in attention bias towards threat-cues in youth with OCD.||Hypothesis 1b: AMP treatment will be associated with a decrease in OCD symptom severity among OCD youth as measured by clinician-administered diagnostic interview and symptom rating scales.||Aim 2: To examine the changes in neurocognitive status over the course of treatment with AMP in children and adolescents with OCD.||Hypothesis 2: Those children who respond to AMP will exhibit improved performance on relevant neurocognitive measures at post-treatment.||Aim 3: To examine the relationship between baseline neurocognitive status and response to AMP.||Hypothesis 3: Baseline neurocognitive performance will be associated with greater AMP-related improvement in symptom severity among youth with OCD.||Exploratory Aim: To investigate the potential relationship between AMP and changes in behavioral and electrophysiological (EEG) correlates of cognitive control and affect regulation before and after treatment with AMP or ACC. The objective is to examine the feasibility, acceptability and suitability of using Error-Related Negativity (ERN), an evoked response potential (ERP) generated from cognitive activation paradigms assessing action-monitoring and conflict resolution under neutral and emotional contexts, to elucidate potential neural mechanisms underlying treatment. Although not powered for formal tests of mediation, we will explore in a preliminary fashion whether these neural indices may serve as potential biomarkers for pediatric OCD as well as predictors/mediators of treatment response.||Preliminary hypotheses: 1) Youth with OCD will be characterized by high amplitude ERN, which will not change with treatment; 2) AMP treatment will be associated with changes in EEG reflecting greater engagement of top-down (as indexed by the P3 component) versus bottom-up (indexed by the P1/N1 components) neural processes, particularly among children who exhibit improved performance on cognitive control tasks; 3) Baseline executive functioning in interference control and action monitoring will be associated with greater AMP-related improvement in OCD severity; 4) We will also explore the relationships of key variables such as trait anxiety, self-reported attention control, baseline OCD symptom severity and attention bias with each other and with response to AMP.||OCD is a chronic and often disabling psychiatric condition, affecting 2-4% of children and adolescents1. In the absence of effective treatment, it is often associated with considerable social, academic and familial impairment along with considerable psychiatric comorbidity including Tourette's and other Chronic Tic Disorders. Although a number of empirically supported treatments, both behavioral and pharmacological, exist for OCD, many children and their families are either not able to adequately access these treatments or derive only partial benefit from them. Thus, it is of critical importance to expand treatment options and develop more effective treatments that have the potential to be widely accessible to children suffering from OCD.||One etiological model of OCD proposes that symptoms arise from the abnormal processing of threat-relevant information. According to this model, selective attention to threatening information heightens anxiety and anxiety-related avoidance of the perceived threat, and the avoidance behaviors, in turn, prevent disconfirmation of fear-related beliefs and serves to maintain anxiety. Thus, attention bias towards threat may be causally related to the behavioral avoidance of the perceived threat. Research indicates that attention bias towards OCD related material ameliorates after effective cognitive behavioral therapy, thus highlighting that attention bias is malleable. Nevertheless, the critical question remains whether a reduction in attention bias causes a reduction in OCD symptoms or whether attention bias is an epiphenomenon of the symptoms. Recently, studies have begun to directly manipulate attention bias to address this question. In one such study, attention was trained in adults with OCD contamination fears by building a contingency between the locations of the OCD-related word in the active condition and not in the control condition on a modified dot-probe task. Participants in the attention training group showed significant reductions in both attention bias for threat and OCD symptom severity. The extension of this research to clinical patient and child samples with a multi-session treatment protocol has yet to be conducted. To date, no study has investigated attention training in children with OCD, although there are data to suggest positive results in adults with OCD as well as Social Phobia and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.||A number of recent studies have demonstrated that the willful direction of attention in the presence of threatening stimuli activates prefrontal regions thought to be involved in attention control, which in turn appears to down-regulate activation of the amygdala, a structure involved in the emotional processing of fear/threat stimuli. Many of these tasks have involved techniques like cognitive reappraisal or altering cognitive processing of threatening. The question remains whether similar neurobiological mechanisms underlie the effects of attention training. Given the importance of higher-level attention control in reducing biased attention processing and dampening anxious states, helping anxious individuals improve attention control may be an important mechanism for reducing the negative impact and development of psychopathology. In an attempt to gather preliminary data on the possible neurocognitive predictors and mechanisms of treatment response, we also plan to assess aspects of response inhibition and memory/learning that have been implicated in neurocognitive studies of OCD before and after treatment with AMP.||We hypothesize that training attention away from OCD-related threat stimuli will decrease attention bias towards the threat and based on the assumption that attention bias is causally related to anxiety symptoms, this decrease in bias would lead to a decrease in avoidance of threatening stimuli. More specifically, we predict that compared to the control condition (ACC), AMP will decrease attention bias towards the threat and facilitate behavioral approach towards the feared stimuli in children with OCD along with an overall decrease in their symptom severity.||The present study focuses on children and adolescents for two important reasons. First, OCD typically onsets in childhood, and enhanced understanding of the neuro-developmental correlates of OCD and mechanisms underlying treatment at this age has the potential to prevent long-term morbidity. Second, the focus on this age group allows us to study the disorders prior to the development of significant secondary psychiatric and psychosocial morbidity, which commonly accompanies OCD in adulthood. Thus far, only limited research on the effects of attention modification training on OCD severity has been conducted in children. This study may generate significant new information concerning the neurocognitive underpinnings of OCD, the commonality of these underpinnings to other neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood, and the neurocognitive correlates of response to a potentially new and relatively accessible nonpharmacological treatment intervention. This knowledge will be used to develop more effective treatments with an eye towards matching interventions to specific individuals on the basis of characteristic pre-treatment cognitive profiles.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

The validity of TS-spectrum OCD as a distinct subtype is assessed using a detailed clinical, family, drug treatment response profile in adult OCD patients.||In Study I, patients are divided prospectively into 2 putative subtypes (TS-spectrum and non-TS-spectrum OCD) on the basis of clinical history and direct, structured interviews of family members (approximately 400 interviews).||In Study II, patients enter an 8-week single-blind trial with the potent and selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FX).

NCT01635569,"Effective OCD treatment approaches in children and youth include cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) and serotonergic medications; however, the disorder is under-diagnosed and access to care is frequently delayed or difficult to obtain. Moreover, despite the important role of family accommodation as an outcome predictor, standard CBT does not systematically include parents and mechanisms of response are not fully understood. The investigators propose to address this challenge by evaluating a novel treatment approach called Group-based Family CBT (GF-CBT).||To determine clinical and neural effects of GF-CBT, we will perform a case-control study of two groups: Group 1 - OCD-affected youth receiving GF-CBT treatment (N=90); Group 2 - OCD-affected youth receiving no new treatment (waitlist controls; N=90).||The investigators will collect clinical outcome data related to OCD severity, individual and family functioning at four time points for Group 1 subjects and at two time points for Group 2 subjects. For Group 1 subjects, these time points include baseline, at midpoint, at the completion of 12 sessions, and at one-month follow-up (all time points are +/- one week). For Group 2 subjects, time points will be at baseline and after a time delay equivalent to completion of 12 GF-CBT sessions.

NCT03661905,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a serious and often severe mental disorder and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Effective psychological interventions for OCD exist, but the prevailing option (Exposure and Response Prevention; ERP) has changed very little since it was established in the 1960's; moreover, it is associated with unacceptably high numbers of individuals who drop out from, or refuse the treatment altogether. This is largely because ERP is a difficult treatment, wherein individuals face their fears with increasing difficulty over time. Just as with the development from early chemotherapy and HIV agents, which were effective, but associated with serious and often severe side effects, it is now time to enhance the acceptability of psychological treatments for OCD.||A novel cognitive therapy (CT) approach is likely to be just as effective as ERP, but markedly more acceptable to those who need it. Although CT for OCD is as effective as ERP, previously tested CTs have failed to incorporate recent experimental research, novel cognitive targets or enhancements to acceptability. Indeed, the investigators recent work on treatment acceptability promises to increase the number of individuals who can fully and successfully engage with the treatment.||The purpose of this research is to enhance the acceptability of cognitive-behavioural treatments for OCD; the investigators aim to accomplish this via a randomized controlled trial comparing traditional ERP against the investigators' novel CT approach. Although the investigators expect both treatments to be effective, the primary hypothesis is that CT will be significantly more acceptable to participants than ERP; this will be assessed by the relative numbers of treatment refusers and dropouts, as well as by participant ratings of treatment acceptability.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00358995,"Participants will be phone-screened to determine broad suitability and interest in being in the study, as well as availability.

It is believed that this behaviourally-based intervention encourages extinction of reassurance seeking over time by eliminating reinforcement of the behaviour by significant others.||The support-seeking intervention asks participants to move towards adaptively seeking support from a significant other to manage anxiety or distress rather than seeking reassurance.

NCT01555970,"OCD is a debilitating psychiatric condition with a lifetime prevalence of 2-3%. It is characterized by recurrent, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and/or repetitive, stereotyped behaviors (compulsions) that last for at least one hour per day and significantly interfere with an individual's normal level of functioning. Although cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) are effective treatments for many patients, a subset experience minimal relief from their symptoms with these standard treatments. When severe, OCD is completely incapacitating with devastating consequences for patients and their families. Augmentation strategies with antipsychotic medications can improve the effectiveness of SRI therapy but do no eliminate OCD symptoms (Saxena et al., 1996; McDougle et al., 1995) and are associated with adverse effects when used chronically; consequently, improved pharmacological treatments are needed. The clinical observation that few patients experience a complete response to SRI's or dopamine antagonists suggests that other neurochemical systems are involved in the pathophysiology of OCD.||The pathophysiologic hypothesis underlying this proposal is that the well-described hyperactivity of the cortico-striato-thalamic track in OCD reflects glutamatergic hyperactivity that is addressed only partially in some OCD patients by serotonin reuptake inhibitors treatment. It is thought that NAC modulates brain glutamate by stimulating the cysteine-glutamate antiporter located on glia, increasing extrasynaptic glutamate levels and thereby stimulating the feedback inhibition of synaptic glutamate release (Baker et al., 2003). In addition to attenuating synaptic glutamate release by feedback inhibition, NAC is also thought to enhance the clearance of glutamate from the synapse via its neuroprotective and growth factor promoting effects on glial cells. Its glutamatergic antagonistic properties may be effective in reducing the glutamatergic hyperactivity that is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of OCD.||The proposed study is based on recent preclinical and neuroimaging studies that implicate glutamatergic hyperactivity in the pathogenesis of OCD (Carlsson et al., 2000). Neuroimaging studies have consistently identified increased blood flow, metabolism and brain activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and thalamus of individuals with OCD (Baxter et al., 1987, 1988, 1992; Swedo et al., 1989; Sawle et al., 1991; Rubin et al., 1992, 1995; Adams et al., 1993; Perani et al., 1995; McGuire et al., 1994; Breiter et al., 1996; Rausch et al., 1996). Within these brain areas, glutamate and GABA driven pathways are thought to be responsible for balancing neural tone. The direct (glutamatergic) pathway is thought to modulate the initiation and sustainability of behavioral routines, while the indirect (GABAergic) pathway modulates the cessation of these behaviors. The leading explanatory model for OCD suggests that over activity in the direct pathway relative to the indirect pathway results in a disinhibited thalamus and the creation of a self-perpetuating circuit between the thalamus and the orbital cortex that drives OCD symptoms (Baxter 1992, Baxter et al., 1996). Clinical studies support this model. Compared to controls, treatment naïve OCD patients have significantly increased glutamatergic activity as measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) (Rosenberg et al., 2000; Bolton et al., 2001). Moreover, treatment with an SRI was associated with a significant decline in caudate glutamate concentration in those individuals who responded to SRI treatment (Rosenberg et al., 2000; Bolton et al., 2001). These clinical findings are consistent with pharmacological studies demonstrating an SRI-induced inhibition of glutamate release (Maura et al, 1988; Zhang et al., 1997).||The investigators propose a double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of N-Acetylcysteine in the augmentation of SRI therapy in resistant OCD. Four recent reports suggest that riluzole, an antiglutamatergic agent, possesses anti-depressant, anti-obsessional, and anti-anxiety properties (Coric et al., 2003, 2005; Zarate et al., 2004; Sanacora et al., 2004).||The rationale for exploring the efficacy of NAC in treatment resistant OCD stems from preliminary findings from the open label Riluzole study and represents an effort to explore other novel strategies for modulating brain glutamate in OCD.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00932204,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common psychiatric disorder characterized by repetitive, intrusive thoughts and time-consuming behavioral or mental acts. Many OCD patients who do not respond to conventional treatments experience severe distress and disruptions in their daily activities. Novel approaches including psychopharmacological therapy and surgical techniques for treatment-resistant OCD have been proposed. With recent advances in non-invasive technique for stimulating the cerebral cortex, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for various psychiatric illnesses including OCD.||Because of contradictory findings and a lack of controlled trials in OCD, rTMS cannot be yet recommended as routine therapy for OCD. However, it may have a potential clinical effect as a putative add-on treatment for OCD and an alternative therapy for treatment-resistant OCD.||For useful clinical applications, it is very important to develop methods to enhance the efficacy of rTMS. There are a number of putative ways to do this, and one of them is sequentially combining two forms of stimulation which are considered to have potential therapeutic effects. More recently, the sequential application of two stimulation regimens (high-frequency left-side rTMS and low-frequency right-side rTMS to the prefrontal cortex) has been found to have a substantial therapeutic effect in patients with treatment-resistant major depression. Therefore, the investigation for a sequentially combining effect of both the right prefrontal and the SMA stimulation would be worthwhile in OCD patients.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00316355,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating anxiety disorder. People with OCD often experience recurrent unwanted thoughts, called obsessions, and repetitive behaviors, called compulsions. These thoughts and behaviors interfere with everyday life to a great extent. Currently, the most frequently used psychosocial treatment for OCD is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that incorporates exposure with ritual prevention (EX/RP). However, although effective, this treatment approach is largely inaccessible, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. A stepped-care approach to treating OCD may be more cost-effective and therefore more accessible for many individuals. Stepped-care CBT begins with the least expensive, least intrusive, most accessible option, and works up to the most expensive option if the less intrusive treatments do not work. This study will determine the benefits and cost-effectiveness of a stepped care treatment program for OCD.||Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive CBT for 6 to 14 weeks either through the stepped-care approach or immediately upon study entry. Participants will report to the study site for treatments and assessments on a regular basis, ranging from every 2 weeks to twice a week, depending on the stage of the study and the assigned treatment group. Stepped-care CBT will begin with self-administered EX/RP combined with counseling to address medication issues, life stress, and motivational enhancement. If ineffective, this treatment will be followed by therapist-administered EX/RP. OCD symptoms will be assessed at Week 6. Participants who have responded to treatment after 6 weeks will not receive further treatment. All others will continue for an additional 8 weeks. These participants' OCD symptoms will be assessed again at Week 14. Participants assigned to the stepped-care approach whose OCD symptoms improved initially, but relapsed without further treatment by the Week 14 evaluation will receive full-scale CBT. Outcomes will be assessed again at 1- and 3-month follow-up visits.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT01329133,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common psychiatric condition with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 2-3 % of the general population. It is generally characterized by a chronic course leading to a profound impairment in psychosocial functioning and to a marked deterioration in quality of life. Today, the well-established efficacy of antidepressants, acting preferentially by blocking serotonin reuptake, in addition to psychological treatments, have considerably changed the poor prognosis of the illness. However, both conventional therapeutic approaches failed to substantially alleviate obsessive-compulsive symptoms in 20-30% of cases. Deep brain stimulation, as a reversible and adjustable surgical procedure, has recently been introduced in the field of OCD, primarily targeting either the ventral striatum (VS) or the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and leading to an approximately 40% or greater reduction in clinical symptom intensity from baseline levels in severely chronic and resistant forms of OCD. These promising findings lead to propose a comparison of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of DBS choosing either the VS or STN as brain target by conducting a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, single-blind trial over a 13-month follow-up period. For this purpose, a total population of 28 OCD patients who meet the currently used operational criteria for defining therapeutic resistance will be recruited. The surgical procedure will consist in the implantation of stimulation electrodes with four contacts on each lead, which are stereotactically and bilaterally implanted into the targeted brain structure under local anesthesia. Per-operative, single-unit electrophysiological recordings of the neuronal activity will be performed using five parallel microelectrodes and serving as guide for the implantation of both definitive electrodes. They will be connected to a battery powered pulse-generating device five days later under general anesthesia. Thereafter, psychiatric assessments including both the Y-BOCS (""Yale-Brow Obsessive-compulsive scale"") and PI (""Padua Inventory"") for measuring OCD symptom severity, the BAS (""Brief Anxiety Scale""), MADRS (""Montgomery and Asberg Depression rating Scale"") and HAD (""Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale"") for determining anxiety and/or depressive symptom intensity, and the CGI (""Clinical Global Impression"") rating scales for evaluating global symptom severity and treatment response will be performed every 3 months beyond the one-month postoperative free-stimulation period. This will be coupled with a large battery of neuropsychological tests exploring all executive functions in combination with precise medical records of side effects for appreciating safety/tolerability of DBS. A cost-effectiveness analysis, as a formal method of comparing DBS and classical therapeutic strategies with regard to their respective resource utilization (costs) and outcomes (effectiveness) will also be carried out. Therefore, the present study may contribute to highlight the special interest of DBS, as an effective, safe, well-tolerated and cost-relevant surgical approach for the management of resistant OCD.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00854919,"More recently, second-generation atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPD) that modulate both 5-HT and DA function, such as risperidone (RIS), olanzapine (OLZ) and quetiapine (QET), have been found effective in the augmentation of SSRIs for treatment-resistant OCD.||Nevertheless, the AAPDs have been associated with common and serious adverse effects, such as body weight (BW) gain and metabolic dysregulation. Metabolic dysregulation includes glucoregulatory dysfunction and dyslipidemia. Indeed, studies of some AAPD in SSRI-refractory OCD patients have similarly reported significant BW gain. AAPD-induced BW gain may influence patients' adherence to medication and places them at risk for a broad range of medical problems.||Most work on AAPDs in treatment-refractory OCD has been conducted in the form of short-term efficacy studies. There have been fewer studies of the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of these agents in the context of a clinic where CBT is also provided, and where treatment is continued for a significant period of time.

This study aims to assess the efficacy of duloxetine for the treatment of OCD.||Before subjects give written informed consent, they are made aware of alternatives to participation in this study, which can include independently seeking pharmacotherapy or cognitive behavioral treatment for OCD. Patients will then begin open-label treatment with duloxetine at 30 mg/day and will be seen again in one week (Visit 2). At Visit 2, patients will be assessed and, if they are not experiencing any significant side effects, the dose will be increased to 60 mg/day. Patients who are experiencing significant side effects at 30 mg/day will be discontinued from the study and offered standard treatment in our clinic. Patients taking 60 mg/day will then return for assessment in four weeks (Visit 3). At this time, if they are not experiencing any significant side effects, the dose will then be increased to 120 mg/day. Patients who are unable to tolerate 120 mg/day will have their dose decreased back down to 60 mg/day and will continue the trial. End of study final statistical analyses will be conducted both including and excluding these patients. Remaining assessments will be every 4 weeks (Visits 4, 5, 6). Thus, in total this is a 17-week study with 12 weeks at the high dose believed to be necessary for response.||At each visit following the initial visit, patients will be assessed using the Y-BOCS, BDI, BAI, and CGI. The Q-LES-Q will only be administered at the initial and last visit.||The study procedure is similar to standard medical treatment for OCD at MGH. Like standard care, participants start on the lowest dose of the medication and then increase that dose to the maximally tolerated level. Barring any significant side effects, the patient remains on that dose for 4-8 weeks to provide the medication with an adequate trial period. At the end of that period, efficacy would be assessed and other alternatives would be discussed.||One difference between the study and standard care is that the study will provide more assessment through verbal and written scales. This additional assessment could greatly benefit the patient as they decide between other treatment options. Another difference is that participants cannot be involved in current behavior therapy throughout the study. Many patients choose to pursue medical treatment without behavior therapy in standard care; however, in standard care, they have the option of pursuing both concurrently or pursuing just behavior therapy. If a patient wishes to pursue just behavior therapy or receive medication and therapy concurrently, then other forms of treatment at MGH might be more appropriate. If they only want medical treatment, the study is similar to standard care at a lower cost.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT03595098,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder is the fourth most common psychiatric disorder, affecting 1-3% of children and adolescents globally. The recommended first-line treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention. Yet, more than 40% of patients do not, or only partially, benefit from therapy. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying response to cognitive behavioral therapy is needed to improve treatment. In the TECTO study, we will conduct a combined randomized clinical trial and longitudinal case-control study to elucidate how neural, cognitive, emotional, and neuroendocrine factors moderate and mediate treatment response. At baseline, 128 children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder will be compared to 128 healthy control participants to map neurobiological, cognitive, and emotional markers of obsessive-compulsive disorder. After baseline assessment, patients are randomly assigned to 16 weeks of either cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention or an active control treatment with psychoeducation and relaxation training. This design allows us to test how factors that are specific to cognitive behavioral therapy (e.g. exposure and response prevention) contribute to observed treatment effects. Our primary outcome is OCD symptom severity measured with the Children's Yale-Brown Obessive-Compulsive Scale. Secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life and negative treatment effects. To detect neural and cognitive mediators of treatment, we will measure brain structure and function, and cognitive performance, at baseline and end-of-treatment. Furthermore, we will monitor a range of therapeutic, emotional, family, and neuroendocrine factors before, during, and after treatment. We expect that findings from TECTO will have important theoretical implications and will help refine our understanding of OCD as a heterogeneous and multidimensional disorder. Finally, we expect that our findings will contribute significantly to the improvement of psychotherapy and development of more targeted interventions for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder, which can minimize the use of medication, prevent chronicity, and reduce the substantial socioeconomic burden of the disorder.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT00106249,"This study tests the efficacy of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) guided repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This study also examines measures of brain function that may inform us about the brain basis underlying OCD.||Despite major advances in the study and treatment of OCD, patients often do not respond or experience only partial remission from pharmacotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy. rTMS is a non-invasive procedure that allows stimulation of the brain using magnetic fields. Some studies have reported that rTMS may be helpful in reducing obsessive and compulsive symptoms. While promising, prior research has several limitations (e.g., relatively small sample sizes, stimulation of sub-optimal target areas, relatively short durations of treatment, and lack of sham (placebo) comparison).||This study addresses the drawbacks of prior work, and will provide data that will be important in determining whether rTMS can be useful for OCD patients resistant to conventional therapies. In this trial, 32 adult outpatients with OCD, that have been only partially responsive to conventional therapies, will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (active low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS or sham-placebo) applied to the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) daily for up to four weeks. If rTMS will be added onto ongoing pharmacotherapy, the doses must have been stable for 3 months prior to study entry. The SMA was selected because of its connections with areas of the brain, especially motor areas, implicated in OCD. Pilot work indicates that stimulation of SMA with low frequency rTMS was beneficial in OCD patients. Low frequency rTMS has the added benefit of a better safety profile (i.e. no risk of seizure) compared to high frequency rTMS.||Rating scales for symptom change will be obtained at baseline, during the rTMS course, and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. Patients who do not meet response criteria after four weeks of sham and partial responders to either active or sham will be offered an open-label, cross-over phase for an additional four weeks of daily active rTMS treatment. Patients who meet response criteria in either the randomized phase or the cross-over phase will continue routine clinical care under the supervision of their treating psychiatrist, and will be invited back for a repeat assessment at 3 and 6 months to determine the persistence of benefit.||Measures of the excitability of the motor cortex have been reported to be abnormal in OCD, and may relate to dysfunction in motor pathways related to OCD circuits.

NCT02818088,"It is currently unclear whether cognitive training using a working memory task, is effective in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms and neuropsychological deficits in patients with OCD. Two groups (OCD and control) will be recruited. Both groups will undergo an intervention consisting of 8 weeks of cognitive training. Working memory, neuropsychological functioning and OCD symptomatology will be assessed pre and post-treatment, in both groups. Furthermore neuroimaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be conducted at baseline as well as at the end of the 8 week period in both groups. The scan will serve to show any structural or functional changes in the frontostriatal area involved with working memory.

NCT00000384,"To contrast the degree and durability of improvement in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), patients will be treated with 1 of 6 conditions (3 active treatments and 3 control treatments): sertraline alone (SER), OCD-specific Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), both SER and CBT (SER plus CBT), pill placebo (PBO), pill PBO plus Educational Support (ES), and SER plus ES.||One in 200 youth suffers from OCD, yet relatively few receive appropriate treatment. Both CBT and medication appear beneficial in controlled studies; however, the relative efficacy of CBT and medication, alone and in combination (COMB) is unknown. Thus, well-designed treatment outcome studies are necessary to improve care for youth with OCD.||The experimental design covers 2 phases. Phase I is a 2 (site) x 2 (SER or pill PBO) x 3 (CBT, ES or non- psychosocial treatment) x 5 (repeated measures) factorial 12-week comparison of SER, CBT, COMB and the control conditions. In Phase II, responders advance to a 16-week discontinuation study to assess treatment durability. The primary outcome measure is the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale.

NCT03300947,"The study seeks to improve our ability to treat and improve the lives of people who have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by exploring the benefits of psilocybin, a mind-altering drug that changes activity in brain areas believed to be involved in OCD. Anecdotal reports and results from previous research support this idea. This two-phase study will enroll patients with symptomatic OCD who are not taking mind-altering medications or street drugs.||During Phase One, neither participants nor the investigators will know which drugs or doses are administered. This information will be available if it is medically necessary to reveal which drugs and doses were administered.

NCT00369642,"Distressing, intrusive thoughts, images, or impulses and repetitive mental or behavioral rituals aimed to reduce distress are the hallmark of adult and pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Epidemiological studies suggest a prevalence rate of between 1 to 4% in children and adolescents (Douglass, Moffitt, Dar, McGee, & Silva, 1995; Flament, Whitaker, Rapoport, & Davies, 1988; Zohar, 1999). If untreated, OCD is related to significant social, academic, and familial impairment (Koran, Thienemann, & Davenport, 1996; Piacentini et al., 2003).||Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy with proven efficacy for OCD treatment in adult populations (see Franklin & Foa, 2002 for a review). More recently, several open (Benazon, Ager, & Rosenberg, 2002; March, Mulle, & Herbel, 1994; Piacentini, Bergman, Jacobs, McCracken, & Kretchman, 2002) and one controlled trial (de Haan, Hoogduin, Buitelaar, & Keijsers, 1998) have supported the effectiveness of this approach with children and adolescents diagnosed with OCD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for adult and pediatric OCD can be broken down into two general components. First, in exposure and response prevention (ERP), patients are gradually exposed to anxiety-provoking stimuli while refraining from engaging in compulsive behaviors or rituals (Meyer, 1966). The extended exposure to anxiety-provoking stimuli causes anxiety to habituate and provides objective data that contradicts inaccurate expectations of harm and responsibility (Foa & Kozac, 1996). Second, cognitive therapy teaches the patient to identify and correct anxiety-provoking cognitions that often motivate compulsive behaviors. Objective, realistic cognitions that are not linked to obsessive-compulsive anxiety will result in reduced needs to perform compulsive acts.||Although the results of the above mentioned psychotherapy trials, as well as a number of pharmacological treatment trials, are promising (Cook et al., 2001; DeVeaugh-Geiss, Moroz, Biederman, & Cantwell, 1992; Geller et al., 2001; Liebowitz et al., 2002; March et al., 1998; Riddle et al., 2001), it is important to note that a relatively large number of patients do not respond to treatment in a clinically significant manner. For example, the treatment response rates in recent major drug trials ranged from 42 to 67% (Cook et al., 2001; DeVeaugh-Geiss et al., 1992; Geller et al., 2001; Liebowitz et al., 2002; Riddle et al., 2001), whereas the treatment response rate in the referenced psychotherapy trials ranged from 63 to 79%. As such, it is important to identify and test potential treatment approaches that may be suitable for treatment refractory pediatric OCD patients.||One manner of treating children with OCD who do no adequately respond to conventional medication or psychotherapy interventions is through intensive CBT. The UF OCD Program in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Florida utilizes the principles of CBT. Our intensive program provides CBT services to children on an outpatient basis. Intensive outpatient treatment involves the child and his/her parent(s) or guardian(s) moving to Gainesville for three weeks, which usually requires staying in a hotel, unless the person has friends or relatives living in the area. Patients are seen five days per week for approximately three weeks. Sessions typically involve exposure and response prevention in conjunction with cognitive therapy for older children. Family members are involved extensively in treatment to assist with the completion of daily homework exercises and generalization of skills to the home environment. In addition to being an alternative approach for treatment refractory youth, there are a number of other benefits that an intensive program for pediatric OCD may offer. First, an intensive approach may be well suited for children with severe symptomatology or functional impairment (e.g., not going to school; Franklin, Tolin, March, & Foa, 2001; Storch, Gelfand, Geffken, & Goodman, 2003). Second, existing outpatient interventions typically achieve treatment gains over a 15 to 20 week period. Intensive treatment typically lasts three to four weeks, and thus may present as a more timely, cost-effective, and efficient means of treatment, particularly when the child is missing out on important normative events (e.g., school attendance). Third, many people do not have access to mental health professionals who are trained in empirically grounded OCD treatment and thus, are unable to receive the most effective care. For example, Flament et al. (1988) found that only 22% of a sample of children with OCD were receiving mental health services. Moreover, none of those being treated were receiving appropriate, empirically validated intervention. Finally, time-limited, intensive programs may enhance the child's motivation by becoming the primary focus for several weeks, which may not be the case with standard weekly treatment (Foa & Steketee, 1987).||Although several open and controlled trials of intensive psychotherapy for adult OCD have been published (Abramowitz, Foa, & Franklin, 2003; Cottraux et al., 2001; Foa, Kozak, Steketee, & McCarthy, 1992; Storch et al., 2003), to date, only two examples of intensive outpatient treatment for OCD in childhood has been reported (Franklin et al., 2001; Storch et al., 2004). Franklin et al. (2001) describes a 12-year-old boy with severe OCD who was seen five days per week for a total of 11 sessions. Results indicated marked improvements in clinician-rated OCD symptoms and self-reported depressive symptoms. Storch et al. (2004) provides data on five children with OCD consecutively seen in intensive cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy. Assessments were conducted at baseline and after treatment. All participants were classified as treatment responders (much improved or very much improved). Two of the participants did not meet diagnostic criteria for OCD following treatment. The severity of clinician-rated OCD symptoms and impairment significantly decreased after the intervention.||Under the proposed controlled trial, we plan to examine the efficacy of daily cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy to 50 consecutive children and adolescents who enroll in the UF OCD program. Children will be randomized to one of two treatment conditions: one consists of receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy every weekday for three-weeks; the other consists of receiving treatment as usual, which consists of once per week outpatient cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions . As compared to the once per week therapy condition, we predict decreases in OCD, general anxiety, and depressive symptomatology, and functional impairment at post-intervention for youth in the daily therapy condition.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT01100255,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric illness that affects up to 2-3% of the population. People with OCD experience anxiety-provoking, intrusive thoughts, known as obsessions, and feel compelled to perform repetitive behaviors, or compulsions. The only medications proven effective for OCD are serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), but even with SRI treatment, most patients continue to experience significant OCD symptoms, impaired functioning, and diminished quality of life. Recent evidence suggest that a different neurotransmitter, glutamate, may contribute to the symptoms in OCD. Medications that target glutamate hold promise for ameliorating symptoms for those patients continuing to suffer from OCD.

NCT00044239,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects nearly 1% of the pediatric population. The intrusive symptoms of this illness can interrupt normative development, causing significant psychological distress and producing life-long impairments in social, academic, and occupational functioning. Current research supports a neurobiologic model for OCD. Converging lines of evidence suggest that a post-infectious autoimmune-mediated process may be associated with the pathogenesis of some pediatric cases. This subgroup has been designated by the acronym, PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The abrupt symptom onset and relapsing-remitting course of illness characteristic of the PANDAS subgroup appears to define a distinct cohort of patients, in whom symptom exacerbations occur synchronously with Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infections.||We propose to perform prospective, longitudinal evaluations of a group of 72 children with recent onset OCD and 72 age-/sex-matched healthy volunteers. All children will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including physical, neurological and psychiatric evaluations, neuropsychological testing, structural MRI and MRS scans, and laboratory assays. The children with OCD will be evaluated in the NIMH outpatient clinic at six-week intervals for a 28-month period to obtain prospective ratings of neuropsychiatric symptom severity, physical and neurological assessments, and anti-streptococcal antibody titers. At the end of the observation period, each OCD patient will be placed into a cohort based on the course of his or her symptoms: those displaying an acute onset and episodic course of OCD will be assigned to the ""episodic"" group, while those children with a gradual onset and stable course will comprise the ""persistent"" group. We hypothesize that the episodic group will have GABHS infections concurrent with their neuropsychiatric symptoms exacerbations and will meet criteria for the PANDAS subgroup. In contrast, children in the persistent group are not expected to have distinct periods of relapse nor a temporal association between GABHS infections and worsening of their symptoms. We expect that children in the PANDAS subgroup will demonstrate cross-reactive antibodies (antistreptococcal/antineuronal) during symptom exacerbations. At the conclusion of the study, we will perform group comparisons between the episodic OCD and persistent OCD cohorts, as well as between the patients and controls. The purpose of these comparisons is to identify baseline markers of membership in the PANDAS subgroup. The possibilities include distinctive HLA subtypes, quantitative differences in cytokines distribution, unique MRS chemical profiles, or a specific pattern of deficits on neuropsychological tests of basal ganglia function.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT00822601,"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to be an effective therapeutic tool for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders including major depression and hallucinations in schizophrenia but, to date, studies exploring the effects of rTMS in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) have produce negative or conflicting results, especially those applying the stimulation to the prefrontal cortex as for the treatment of depression. However, a promising result has been obtained in a study in which the rTMS was applied to the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA), but in a small size and heterogeneous sample. The SMA has connections with areas of the brain, especially motor areas and subcortical-limbic circuitry, implicated in OCD.||In our study, 40 adult outpatients with OCD, who have been insufficiently responsive to at least two recognized drug treatments, will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (active low frequency (1 Hz, 100% of the motor threshold) rTMS or sham-placebo) applied to the SMA daily for up to four weeks.

NCT00640133,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating illness that affects between 2% and 3% of adults in the United States. People with OCD often experience persistent unwanted thoughts and carry out ritual-like behaviors to rid themselves of these obsessive thoughts. Additionally, OCD symptoms are usually tied with feelings of intense anxiety and functional impairment, making it important for people with OCD to seek effective treatment. Although there are currently many treatment options for OCD, including psychotherapy and medications such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, between 40% and 60% of people with OCD only partially respond or do not respond at all to these treatment methods. Given the large percentage of people who do not respond to aggressive conventional treatments, alternative options are necessary for people with treatment-resistant OCD. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a procedure that involves the use of thin wires to carry electric current to parts of the brain associated with producing OCD symptoms. DBS has been effectively and safely used to treat movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, and may be beneficial in reducing OCD symptom severity. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of DBS in treating people with severe and otherwise treatment-resistant OCD.||Study participation through follow-up will last 4 years. Participants will be allowed to remain on any pre-surgical medications or behavioral therapy programs throughout the study. Before surgery, all participants will undergo a 3- to 4-day series of initial tests and examinations that will include a physical and neurological examination; blood and urine screening tests; an electrocardiogram (EKG); an electroencephalography (EEG); and detailed psychological testing, including tests of perception, learning, and memory. The EEGs may be performed again after surgery to measure potential changes in brain electrical activity due to DBS.||On the day of the surgery, participants will take a low dose of anxiety medication, have a metal frame fixed to their heads for support during surgery, and undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to determine where to place the stimulating wires. After being injected with a local anesthetic, participants will undergo the first part of the operation, which will involve the implantation of neurostimulators in the ventral caudate/ventral striatum brain region. For the second part of the operation, after participants are administered general anesthesia, they will have the implantable neurostimulators (INSs) placed in their chests and the connecting wires to the brain placed under their skin. The entire surgical procedure will take 3 to 4 hours, with a 1- to 2-day post-operative hospital stay for recovery. During the post-operative stay, participants will undergo x-rays and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head.||Two to 3 weeks after surgery, participants will be divided randomly into either a group that receives DBS immediately or a group that first receives sham DBS and then active DBS after 3 months.

NCT02196090,"Background||Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a condition associated with recurrent intrusive distressing thoughts, images and urges compelling the person to perform neutralizing acts or thoughts to the extent of significantly interfering with their daily activities. The symptoms of OCD are associated with both subjective and objective signs of distress. Psychophysiological studies of OCD and other anxiety disorders often report abnormal sympathovagal balance with decreased parasympathetic or vagal tone and increased sympathetic tone (Hoehn-Saric et al 1995, Broderick et al 2013, Kawano et al 2012, Pittig et al 2013, Buhlmann et al 2007, Blechert et al 2007, Friedman and Thayer 1998).||The first line treatment of OCD is Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) which includes Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) when the patient tests out their fears without responding by compulsive act (NICE Clinical Guideline 31). ERP treatment itself is often associated with significant subjective distress (Kellner et al 2012) with dropout rates up to 20% and only minimal improvement in another 20% of patients (Foa 2010). Various modalities of treatment reducing the subjective and physiological distress have been used in treatment of anxiety disorders and symptoms (Streeter et al 2012, Miu et al 2009, Gorman et al 2000) and similar approach could increase the rates of improvement and adherence to ERP treatment in OCD. Most of the attempts to reduce distress in anxiety focus on re-establishing the sympathovagal balance by enhancing the vagal or parasympathetic tone and it has been suggested that this can reduce the mobilization behaviours of fight or flight response and improve emotion regulation (Austin et al 2007). Disgust is an emotion implicated to have significant role on anxiety disorders such as OCD with contamination fears (Moretz and McKay 2008). It has been shown to have only limited response to exposure therapy (Olatunji et al 2009) and can be associated with increased avoidance and reduced compliance with exposures (Olatunji et al 2007) possibly contributing to poorer treatment outcome. Disgust can be associated with changes in sympathovagal balance (Ottaviani et al 2013) but the effect of manoeuvres affecting this balance has not been tested.||Vagal tonus can be increased with specific procedures called vagal manoeuvres. These include the diving reflex, Valsalva manoeuvre, pressure on the eyeball and carotid sinus massage, with the diving reflex being one of the most effective (Arnold 1999). The diving reflex is a phylogenetically ancient physiological phenomenon believed to facilitate survival after immersion in cold water through bradycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction redistributing blood flow to vital organs (Gooden 1994). The combined bradycardia and vasoconstriction effect indicates on complex sympathovagal activation and the bradycardia itself is believed to be due to central vagal activation (Stemper et al 2002). The natural trigger for diving reflex includes change in body position, apnoea and sensation of cold and wet surface on the face and a cold sensation on the face is sufficient to induce the vagal response. This is believed to be transmitted by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve and can be achieved by using cold compressions or cold face gel masks (Khurana et al. 1980).||The physiological response during diving reflex can be measured by recording standard physiological measures such as heart rate, blood pressure or skin conductance. Heart rate and its interpretation in terms of heart rate variability is becoming more frequently utilized to evaluate the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Most frequently used is the frequency domain approach which allows differentiating specific frequency bands. The low frequency (LF) band groups the variability between 0.05-0.15Hz and is believed to represent the sympathetic cardiac control with slower unmyelinated nerve fibres while the high frequency (HF) band including frequencies between 0.15-0.4Hz reflects the parasympathetic or vagal control with faster myelinated nerve fibres (Berntson et al 1997).||Aims of the study||The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a simple vagal manoeuvre, that is a cold face gel mask application, on subjective measures of Anxiety, Disgust, Strength of belief in obsession, Strength of urge to carry out the compulsion, Strength of belief in Theory A/B and an increase in Feeling of being supported, Readiness to face the fear during the ERP treatment of OCD by using a single-case series experimental design and to explore the relationship between subjective measures and sympathovagal balance measured by heart rate variability. Our hypothesis is that:||ERP with application of cold gel face mask (Condition B) will be associated with faster reduction of visual analogue scales of Anxiety, Disgust, Strength of belief in obsession, Strength of urge to carry out the compulsion, Strength of belief in Theory A/B and an increase in Feeling of being supported, Readiness to face the fear compared to ERP as usual with simply resisting the compulsive behaviour (Condition C).|Increase in vagal tonus as documented by heart rate variability measures will correlate with the effect on visual analogue scales of Anxiety, Disgust, Strength of belief in obsession, Strength of urge to carry out the compulsion, Strength of belief in Theory A/B, Feeling of being supported and Readiness to face the fear.||3. Methods||i. Participants: Participants will be recruited from the Anxiety Disorders Residential Unit (ADRU), Bethlem Royal Hospital. All patients admitted to ADRU have the opportunity to consent to be contacted about participating in research studies. Only patients admitted to ADRU for treatment of OCD who provided such initial consent will be approached by Dr Roman Duncko regarding the written informed consent to participate in the present study.||ii. Procedure and Design: On each day of the study, therapy will begin with the Baseline phase (Condition A) and record the psychological (visual analogue scales of Anxiety, Disgust, Belief in obsession, Strength of urge for compulsion, Strength of belief in Theory A/B, Feeling of being supported, Readiness to face the fear) and physiological measures (HR recording) on 3-5 consecutive 5min intervals or until stable baseline measures are achieved. After that, the participant will proceed with the Intervention phase by applying ERP with the use of triggers as identified on their individual hierarchy. Each ERP session will follow the same structure by first obtaining the session baseline at 3 time points, then exposure to trigger and continue with preventing the response while applying the cold face mask for 5 minutes (Condition B) or without using the face mask (Condition C). Psychological and physiological measures will be obtained in 5 minute intervals until return to session baseline. ERP sessions will follow in alternating order for 4 sessions per day (Day 1: ABCBC, Day 2: ACBCB, Day 3: ABCBC). All baseline and exposure measures will be recorded by the investigator who will by accompanying the participant during the procedure. Cold face gel masks will be stored in refrigerator at the ADRU and will be available to the participant as required.||iii. Psychological measures: Visual analogue scales for measurement of severity of Anxiety, Disgust, Strength of belief in obsession, Strength of urge to carry out the compulsion, Strength of belief in theory A/B, Strength of belief in Theory A/B, Feeling of being supported, Readiness to face the fear will be used by the participant at time points as specified above. In addition to this the participant will be assessed for their clinical symptoms (YBOCS, OCI) on weekly basis as part of their standard treatment plan.||On the last day of the study, participants will be asked to complete the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire based on (Larsen et al 1979) to explore the feasibility and acceptability of the cold face gel mask application during ERP.||iv. Physiological measures: Heart rate variability analysis will be performed on data recorded with a Polar RS800CX heart rate monitor using a H2 chest sensor. Polar monitors have been tested against standard clinical ECG equipment and found to be suitable for heart rate variability analysis (Vanderlei et al 2008). In the morning of the study day, the participants will place the Polar heart rate sensor on their chest using the elastic strap. They will be instructed how to use the heart rate monitor watch Polar RS800CX to record the heart rate and press the mark recording button at specific times during each procedure. At the end of each study day, the data will be downloaded from the heart rate monitor watch and 3 time intervals of 2 minutes will be identified: at the beginning of the condition - time 0, at the beginning of the procedure - time 15, at the end of the condition - time 45. Time intervals will be screened for artefacts and used for heart rate variability analysis using standalone analysis software (Niskanen et al 2004). Variables selected for analysis will include heart rate per minute, time domain measures (RMSSD, NN50) and frequency domain measures (nLF at 0.05-0.15Hz, nHF at 0.15-0.04Hz, LF/HF).||v. Data analysis: Data will be initially evaluated by visual inspection for each participant individually. After that, values obtained for a specific time interval and phase will be averaged among all participants and again evaluated by visual inspection. Percentage of non-overlapping data analysis will be performed to detect statistically significant change between the baseline and intervention phase. Pearson's correlation will be used for correlation analyses.||4. Project timetable||The project is planned to run for 6-12 months depending on the rate of recruitment of participants.||5. Expertise in team||Dr David Veale is a consultant psychiatrist in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy at the South London and Maudsley Trust and a Honorary Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London. Specialisms include obsessive compulsive disorder.||Dr Roman Duncko, PhD is a ST5 trainee in General Adult Psychiatry at the South London and Maudsley Trust with long-term research interest in anxiety disorders and autonomic nervous system function.||6. Ethical considerations||All ethical considerations are outlined in the Participant Information and Consent Form that will be distributed to participants. All patients admitted to ARDU who fulfil the inclusion criteria will be approached about participating in the study. All participants will require signing an informed consent to participate. All information and data obtained during the study will be kept in strict confidence. Upon recruitment, every participant will be assigned an anonymous code and the lists linking the code with personal identifying information will be kept secure and separate from the data. Only the Principal Investigator and researchers authorized by the PI will have access to the identifying lists. Every participant will undergo the same procedures with slightly variable order. No deception will be used and participants will be informed as to exactly what the study is about. All participants will be informed at the time of providing consent to participate that they can withdraw from the study at any time and that this will not affect the care they will receive.||7. Dissemination and implementation||Results of the study will be used for poster and/or oral presentations at suitable conferences and for preparing a manuscript for submission in a scientific journal. Depending on the outcome of the study further research will be planned to evaluate the effect of cold face gel mask in a study with randomized control trial design.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00382291,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder that is associated with recurring repetitive behaviors and persistent unwanted thoughts. People with OCD often carry out ritual-like behaviors such as counting, cleaning, or washing their hands in order to momentarily ease their anxiety. A current treatment for people with OCD is the class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A recent re-analysis of clinical trials on children with psychiatric conditions found that the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior when on SSRI-antidepressants was considerably higher than when on placebo. The data also revealed that antidepressant-associated suicidal behavior was not limited to children with depression, but also affected children with OCD and other anxiety disorders. Although the process responsible for increased suicidality is unknown, it may be initiated by a set of symptoms collectively called SSRI induced activation syndrome, which is thought to be common, particularly in children and teens. However, there is a lack of knowledge on this syndrome, including its role in suicidal behavior and how it can be prevented. This study will evaluate a new behavioral test to measure certain side effects linked to antidepressant use. This study will also evaluate the effectiveness of the SSRI sertraline plus cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat people with OCD.||Potential participants will undergo an initial screening visit that will include an interview on psychological symptoms associated with OCD and possible family history of OCD. Eligible participants will then undergo a physical exam, blood draw, DNA sampling, and pregnancy test if applicable. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either sertraline or placebo daily for 18 weeks. At weekly study visits, participants will receive their study drug, complete questionnaires about symptoms of OCD, and undergo vital sign measurements. At specified visits, participants will also perform a task (Stop Signal Task) on a computerized assessment device to measure attention and impulse control and may have blood drawn. For the first 4 weeks participants will wear a wristwatch-like device (actigraph) to monitor sleep patterns. During the first three visits, participants will receive supportive psychotherapy. At Visit 4, participants will begin receiving 60-minute CBT sessions, which will continue until the final visit. The final visit will include a second physical exam, questionnaires, and blood testing.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00316316,"Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating anxiety disorder. People with OCD often experience recurrent unwanted thoughts, or obsessions. Some examples of obsessions include the following: repetitive fears of causing harm or being harmed; fears of contamination and illness; fears of making mistakes; intrusive distressing sexual or religious imagery; and fears of losing things. In an effort to relieve anxiety about these obsessions, people with OCD develop repetitive behaviors called compulsions. Some examples of compulsions include the following: repetitive washing and cleaning; excessive checking; excessive ordering and arranging; and extreme hoarding and saving. These thoughts and behaviors interfere with everyday life to a great extent. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP) is a standard treatment for OCD. EX/RP involves both imaginary and real exposure to situations or settings that may stimulate OCD behavior, and it requires that patients refrain from ritualizing. Motivational interviewing (MI) may help to enhance an individual's motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence. This study will determine the effectiveness of adding MI to CBT that consists of EX/RP in improving treatment outcome in people with OCD.||Participants in this single-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either standard CBT with EX/RP or CBT with EX/RP plus MI. All participants will report to the study site twice weekly for both therapy and assessments for a total of 2 months. Assessments will include interviews and self-rating forms. No medication will be administered during this study. However, participants will continue on any medication that they are taking at the time of study entry.

NCT01135745,"OCD is an anxiety disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts or images (obsessions), which increase anxiety, commonly accompanied by repetitive or ritualistic actions (compulsions), which decrease anxiety. The most frequent symptoms are contamination concerns with consequent washing or concerns about harm to self or others with consequent checking.||Although many OCD patients benefit from pharmacotherapy or CBT, between 7% and 10% of OCD patients fail to benefit from these standard treatments and may be considered treatment-resistant with a chronic deteriorating course. The most severely afflicted and disabled of these patients may be indicated for neurosurgical treatments, often considered as a therapy of last resort.||Neurosurgical procedures currently used in the treatment of severe, treatment-resistant OCD include anterior cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, limbic leucotomy (which is a combination of the first two procedures) and anterior capsulotomy. The commonality between the different neurosurgical procedures is the irreversible lesioning of bilateral neuroanatomical structures and/or interconnecting pathways that are believed to be involved in the control of affect and limbic function.||An alternative neurosurgical treatment option to the standard lesioning procedures is Reclaim® Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Therapy for OCD, which received CE mark in July 2009.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT02355002,"This treatment study examines the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in treating people with OCD and investigates what areas of the brain are involved during emotional learning. TMS is a noninvasive method in which a magnetic ""coil"" is placed near an individual's head and delivers small magnetic pulses into the brain, which produce small electrical currents in the brain, stimulating brain cells that may relieve OCD symptoms. TMS has been FDA approved since 2008 and Health Canada approved since 2002 as a treatment for depression. Our hope is to demonstrate that TMS is a successful treatment option for individuals struggling with OCD symptoms, and to identify the specific areas of the brain that are targeted through TMS.||Patients will be randomized (like the flip of a coin) to one of two groups: 6 weeks of daily active TMS, or 6 weeks of daily placebo (sham) TMS sessions. During phase I, participation in this study will last about 8 weeks and patients will be asked to make about 36 visits to our clinics at the MGH main campus and the MGH Charlestown Navy Yard campus. Patients will also participate in MRI scanning sessions and clinical assessments.||If patients' symptoms do not improve after phase I, they will be invited to participate in phase II. During phase II, patients receive 30 active TMS sessions over 6 weeks, as well as MRI scans and clinical assessments.||Part of the MRI scanning sessions will include participating in a task that uses mild, half-second electric shocks to fingers. The electric current will be generated from a 9V battery (e.g., battery in a smoke alarm), and is much less annoying than a static shock. In order to set the level of the current to be used during the study, we will begin at a level below what patients will be able to feel, and then increase in gradual steps with permission. Patients will be asked to stop the increase at a level of the current that they find highly annoying but not painful. The level of current that patients select during this trial procedure, and no higher level, will be used during the study so that they will not receive any painful electric shocks. The purpose of the electric shock is to create a situation in which emotional learning may occur. Patients will receive no more than ten of these electric shocks.||Compensation is provided for clinical assessments and MRI scan sessions.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT00708240,"Rationale. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often has a childhood onset, and is characterized by recurrent obsessions and compulsions that are perceived as irrational and cause significant interference in daily functioning. Neuropsychological and/or neuroimaging investigations have consistently implicated pathways involving the ventral prefrontal cortical regions in the pathophysiology of the disorder. In the absence of attention or memory loss, OCD patients perform more poorly than controls on tasks requiring inhibition of an automatic response. Dysfunction of a frontal-striatal-thalamic circuit in OCD may be mediated by abnormalities in glutamatergic-serotonin neurotransmission, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the unique class of psychotropic medication with demonstrated efficacy for youth (and adults) with the disorder.||Objectives and hypotheses. The first objective of the study is to examine how executive functions, metacognition performance, and regional brain activations differ in adolescents with OCD compared to healthy controls. Three specific hypotheses will be tested: (1) in adolescents with OCD, the executive functions related to the frontal cortex will be impaired compared to healthy controls; (2) the metacognition performance of the OCD group will be lower than that of the control group; (3) using fMRI, the OCD group's frontal lobe activations during tasks testing response inhibition and working memory, will be higher than those in the control group. The second objective is to investigate how treatment with the SSRI escitalopram will affect executive functions, metacognition performance, and regional brain activations in adolescents with OCD. After pharmacotherapy, three specific hypotheses will be tested: (1) there will be significant improvement from baseline in the OCD group's frontal executive functions and metacognition performance; (2) the differences on executive functions and metacognition performance between the OCD and control groups will no longer be significant; (3) on repeated fMRI procedures, the OCD group's frontal lobe activations will show a significant decrease from baseline. The third objective is to explore, within the patient group, the relationships between the degree of clinical change, and the magnitude of pre-post-treatment changes in neurocognitive performance, and regional brain activations. The hypothesis is that greater clinical improvement will be associated with greater changes on the selected neurocognitive and neurofunctional measures.||Method. Forty subjects, aged 13-19 years, with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD, and 40 sex-, and age-matched healthy controls, will be recruited from Ottawa mental health centers and the community. The study will use a pre- post-treatment design, and include three phases. Phase I: Pre-treatment, the OCD subjects will be compared to controls on clinical, neurocognitive, and functional brain activation measures. Phase II: The OCD subjects will receive open treatment with escitalopram (5 mg to 20 mg/day) for 16 weeks. Phase III: The clinical, neurocognitive, and functional brain activations measures will be repeated in all OCD subjects who completed 16 weeks of escitalopram pharmacotherapy, and the neurocognitive measures in control participants after 16 weeks. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Test, and a Working Memory Task will be used to assess frontal executive functions. The Feeling-of-knowing task and Metacognition Questionnaire will measure metacognition performances. To investigate regional brain activations (only in participants aged 15-19 years), two functional neuroimaging paradigms will be used, a Go/NoGo and a n-Back task, and regional brain activations will be measured using fMRI technology. In patients, clinical severity and changes with treatment will be assessed using the Children's Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, and the Children Depression Inventory.

Specifically, this study will investigate the effects of meditation home practice on symptom alleviation, as related to specific OCD related cognitive processes.The study will be a randomized trial where subjects (N=100) will be randomly assigned to receive either 1) an eight week meditation program involving use of an EEG-based biofeedback device, or 2) wait list as per usual. The experimental design is a 2 (treatment condition: Group 1: Mindfulness, Group 2: Control) by 3 (assessment phase: baseline (week 0), mid-treatment (week 4), post-treatment (week 8)) repeated measures factorial design. Group randomization will be completed by the principal investigator, using the ""GraphPad Quick Calcs"" online calculator which offers simple random allocation into equal-sized groups.Outcome measures will involve ratings of OCD symptom severity, OCD beliefs, mindfulness, and use of thought control strategies. At baseline, mid treatment (session 4), and post intervention, participants will complete the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Obsessive Compulsive Inventory, Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire, Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire, Thought Control Questionnaire, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, Mind Wandering Scale and the Metacognitions Questionnaire. Once per week, participants will complete the YBOCS, TCQ, and MW. This weekly data will be collected online using the ""Survey Monkey"" web portal. Daily practice data from the EEG headsets will be automatically uploaded to an encrypted server.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT03672565,"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a highly debilitating psychiatric disorder that affects many youth. Despite strong empirical support that exposure and response prevention (ERP) is an efficacious and tolerable treatment of pediatric OCD including when presented in intensive formats, most individuals simply do not access or receive this treatment.||The dissemination of efficient interventions is of high public health priority, and graduated, or stepped care, models may be the answer. However, initial interventions within a graduated approach must be appropriate for the severity of the condition, given that unnecessary delays to an optimal dose may result in escalating burden on families and ultimately health services. Indeed, low intensity online CBT and self-help have so far had limited efficacy with less than one third of patients deemed responsive to treatment.||In contrast, brief intensive ERP is likely an efficient and effective alternative to flexibly dosing the level of intervention to the participant's needs. In fact, a recent pilot study (n = 10) providing two 3-hour ERP sessions to youth with OCD observed 60% post-treatment, and 70% 6-month follow-up, remission rates among participants. Extending on this study's findings, by utilizing more conservative remission criteria and providing access to additional doses of intensive ERP to youth not yet achieving remission, holds promise in identifying the level of services utilized by families to achieve meaningful treatment outcomes.||Above and beyond the use of a graduated dose model, many questions remain regarding optimal implementation methods for the behavioral treatment of pediatric OCD. In particular, the impact of treatment setting (i.e. community versus clinic) on response has not been systematically studied within this population. Given increased setting relevance and opportunity for in vivo learning, community exposures may be expected to be more effective; however, as they are associated with additional challenges (e.g., transportation time), their contribution to improvement needs to be directly verified and weighed against these costs.||Therefore, the present study seeks to determine the feasibility of implementing a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) for the behavioral treatment of youth with OCD. The study focuses on evaluating the benefits from a minimum initial dose of intensive exposure and response prevention (ERP) as well as the demand for, and benefits from, additional ERP sessions by still-affected OCD families. In addition, via randomization, the study examines the influence of treatment setting (community vs hospital) on response. Primary outcomes include the impact of treatment on symptom severity and other relevant clinical outcomes (e.g., quality of life, youth- and family-functioning) as well as patient decisions/treatment utilization. Participant perspectives on study/treatment procedures (e.g., acceptability, optimal components) as well as cost-effectiveness (e.g., travel expenses, staff time, service utilization) will also be recorded.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT02655926,"The VS/VC and STN are both 'stations' in the neural circuitry thought to be dysfunctional in OCD. The pre-eminent neurobiological model of OCD implicates abnormalities of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ventral striatum. These structures are integral to limbic cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuitry whereby cortical outputs synapse successively in ventral striatum, ventral pallidum and mediodorsal nucleus of thalamus before projecting back to cortex; within this system, the pallidum projects to thalamus either directly or indirectly via the subthalamic nucleus. It is therefore possible that the observed clinical improvement in OCD with DBS is due to high frequency electrical stimulation disrupting abnormal activity in the limbic circuit and that this can be obtained at either of the two target sites. However, the ventral striatum and STN are thought to have separate functions, important in different ways for modulating information processing in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuitry essential for the control of behaviour. Thus, although both VS/VC and STN DBS affect the same neural circuit, their mechanism of action may be quite different and stimulation at each of these locations may have unique effects on the symptom dimensions of OCD.||Evidence for different clinical effects comes from findings that VS/VC DBS produced early and sometimes dramatic mood elevation and anxiety reduction prior to improvement in obsessions and compulsions whereas STN DBS, while diminishing obsessions and compulsions, had no effect on emotion. This observation is relevant because mood and anxiety are significant symptom dimensions in OCD and increases or decreases in the severity of anxiety or depression are generally accompanied by parallel changes in the severity of obsessions/compulsions. The ventral striatum, as well as being the first target of OFC/ACC cortical outputs, receives inputs from amygdala and midbrain dopaminergic neurones, which together provide the emotional and motivational impetus for goal directed behaviour. The ventral striatum is therefore in a unique position, via its involvement in limbic cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuitry, to influence the cognitive and motor processing in parallel circuits which is preparatory for action selection and ultimately manifest in thoughts and actions. Denys and colleagues proposed that VS/VC DBS influences OCD symptoms via its effect on anxiety and mood. Taking this further, Investigators hypothesize that stimulation of ventral striatal neurones influences reinforcement learning and emotion processing thereby improving mood and reducing anxiety and resulting in a decrease in the intensity of obsessions and compulsions.||STN DBS on the other hand may have a more direct effect on obsessions and compulsions. The limbic STN, like the ventral striatum, is in a unique position to influence behavioural outputs of cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuitry. This is because the STN receives a direct projection from right inferior frontal cortex which acts as a 'hyperdirect pathway', activation of which overrides neural processing in the direct cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic pathway. This results in the inhibition of ongoing, planned acts and thoughts. Investigators therefore hypothesise that, via this inhibitory mechanism, stimulation of STN neurones enables OCD patients to interrupt their repetitive thoughts and actions resulting in a decrease in obsessions and compulsions.||Accordingly, DBS at both sites, because of different mechanisms of action, is predicted to be clinically more effective than stimulation of either site alone. It also follows that if there are two mechanisms mediating OCD improvement, this should be evident in different patterns of cognitive and neurophysiological effects following DBS. In the proposed study Investigators will test these predictions clinically and experimentally by using paradigms designed to distinguish the two hypothetical mechanisms of action.||The main aim of CBT is to enable OCD patients to obtain greater control over behaviour so that they can inhibit their repetitive thoughts and acts and switch to more meaningful alternatives. One abnormal mechanism contributing to such cognitive inflexibility is thought to be blunting of the value of positive and negative reinforcement normally used to guide responses and dependent on intact OFC-striatal neural circuitry. Dysfunction of this cognitive control system has been shown in first-degree clinically unaffected relatives of OCD patients thus confirming this mechanism as a neurobiological phenotype of OCD 15.It is therefore hypothesised that DBS of VS/VC will improve the processing of reinforcing stimuli and that this will result not only in elevation of mood and reduction in anxiety but also in increased cognitive flexibility. Investigators will test this by measuring the effectiveness of VS/VC DBS on clinical measures of mood, anxiety, obsessions and compulsions and relate these to changes in reinforcement learning and emotional processing using cognitive tasks sensitive to OCD which measure the ability to respond appropriately to reinforcing contingencies.||Attentional processes are also thought to contribute to impaired behavioural control in OCD. Being able to stop or inhibit planned acts when environmental circumstances change depends on the function of the right inferior cortical-STN hyperdirect pathway and can be operationalised by measuring the stop signal reaction time (SSRT). The finding of specific prolongation of SSRT in OCD patients and their unaffected first-degree relatives suggests that this cognitive abnormality is also a phenotype of OCD. Although the neural substrate of this mechanism does not involve the limbic cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic circuit, recent evidence suggests that neural systems outside this circuitry, involving the right inferior frontal cortex, are impaired in OCD. Investigators therefore hypothesise that STN DBS allows inhibition of repetitive thoughts and acts in OCD by facilitating the action of the hyperdirect pathway from the right inferior frontal cortex to STN. Investigators will test this by measuring the effectiveness of STN DBS on obsessions and compulsions and relate these to changes in SSRT and performance on other tasks sensitive to right inferior frontal cortex function which measure the ability to inhibit pre-potent tendencies.||OCD symptoms and cognitive impairment may be mediated by abnormal cortical excitability due to aberrant long term depression (LTD) synaptic plasticity and/or reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated intracortical inhibition. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to measure these neurophysiological processes safely in patients undergoing DBS and both abnormalities have been shown to normalise following DBS in other disorders. Investigators will use TMS to assess these neural processes before and after DBS in OCD patients and test for whether there are differential changes from the two DBS sites and whether combined VS/VC and STN DBS produces more vigorous improvements compatible with our hypothesis concerning the superior clinical effects of this condition. Investigators will measure intracortical inhibition not only at rest but also during the anticipation of reinforcement, previously shown to affect motor cortex excitability and which Investigators predict will be specifically affected by VS/VC DBS.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00680602,"During the last decades, different pharmacological and psychotherapeutic strategies have been used to treat patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Drugs that inhibit the serotonin recapture and the cognitive behavior therapy, that includes the exposure with response prevention and cognitive strategies, have been the most efficient treatment so far. This study's aims are to compare group cognitive-behavior therapy and standard pharmacological treatment (SRIs) in a world real population, using broader inclusion criteria. DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for OCD will be used (APA, 1994) and patients will be interviewed with the following instruments: SCID-I and Y-BOCS. Inclusion criteria are: (1) OCD diagnosis, (2) YBOCS score ≥ 16 (for patients with both obsessions and compulsions) or ≥ 10 (for patients with only obsessions or compulsions), (3) informed consent to participate in this clinical trial. Exclusion criteria are: (1) patients with clinical or neurological diseases that may be worsen by the medications included in treatment protocol, (2) Current substance dependence, (3) Current psychotic symptoms, (4) Current suicide risk. Patients will be randomized in blocks of 12 and with stratification for the following parameters: current SSRI, age, sex and previous response to treatment. Rates of improvement will be based on the results of the YBOCS scores for obsessions and compulsions and on the results of the clinical global impression scale. Pos-treatment measures will be assessed by psychiatrists or psychologists not involved in the patients treatment that will be blind for the treatment being received by the patient. The patient will be considered responsive to treatment when he or she presents a reduction in YBOCS score ≥ 35% of the initial score and a CGI score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). The results of this study will help us to identify better health politics planning to a heterogeneous OCD population. So, it will improve our knowledge about the efficacy of the first line treatments in a real world OCD population.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT04432246,"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), as a relatively mature non-invasive neuromodulation technology, has been recommended for the treatment of patients with refractory OCD in multinational guidelines. However, due to the treatment setting and the patient's feature, nearly half of the patients have no significant changes after rTMS treatment.||In order to better predict the outcome of rTMS and improve the treatment efficiency, this project intends to look for markers that have a predictive effect at baseline or early treatment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cheap and fast method that usually occurs before the symptoms change, thus it is possible to determine whether the patient has responded to the intervention.||In this project, the supplementary motor area (SMA) is selected as the stimulation target. The individual head magnetic resonance image positioning and navigation and rTMS compatible real-time EEG acquisition technology are used to monitor the resting state of EEG and rTMS single pulse stimulation and changes in neural networks before and after treatment. This is a preliminary exploration looking for effective predictive indicators of efficacy in EEG and the relationship between EEG and symptoms changes.

NCT01447966,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for OCD includes several core therapeutic elements including establishment of treatment goals, assigned homework, operant conditioning paradigms (the putative mechanism for exposure-based therapies), provision of psychoeducation (e.g., the link between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors), cognitive (e.g., cognitive restructuring) and behavioral (e.g., exposure) coping skill implementation, and target behavior progress assessments. Nevertheless, research is lacking in preschoolers with OCD and these children likely require adaptations to the traditional CBT regimen. Preschoolers often have a high level of family accommodation, whereby the family members become part of the rituals and compulsions in attempt to ease the young child's anxiety. CBT with preschoolers will need to emphasize delivering intervention within the context of the family. The flexibility of this modular approach for treatment (modular therapies allow for variations in the order and intensiveness of the aforementioned treatment elements, providing an individually tailored treatment instead of a one-size-fits-all approach) may be optimally suited for preschoolers with OCD given their wide variability in developmental level and symptom presentation. This is consistent with the NIH Roadmap Initiative which calls for personalized interventions matched to individual patient characteristics. Our OCD research team in the Rothman Center is highly experienced in clinical research for pediatric and adult OCD. The proposed investigation is a single-site controlled trial of CBT in preschool aged youth with OCD aged 3-8 years. We will randomly assign patients to immediate treatment or 6-week Treatment as Usual (TAU) control. A manualized CBT protocol will be followed. Assessments will occur at Screening, Baseline, Post-treatment and 1 and 3-month follow-ups. Ratings of patient OCD symptom severity will be conducted at each time point by trained raters blinded to treatment condition. Diagnosis will be established by an experienced clinician and verified by a validated rating scale conducted with the child's parent(s); cases will be reviewed by study investigators. Assessments will be audio-recorded and verified for integrity. Randomization will be determined immediately following the baseline assessment; patients will be assigned TAU or immediate treatment in a 1:1 ratio. All eligible patients will receive 12 therapy sessions over 6 weeks using the evidence-based treatment protocol that incorporates E/RP and parent involvement; sessions are twice weekly for 60 minutes.

NCT03677947,"The proposed study is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial developed in accordance with CONSORT quality guidelines.The RCT will compare the outcome of 16 sessions of IBCT compared to 16 sessions of ERP in OCD patients. The principal investigators and independent evaluators will be blind to the random allocation treatment conditions with a randomization ratio of 1:1. Both treatments will be administered by trained therapists on a weekly one-on-one basis over a 16-week period with 6-month follow-up conforming to current thinking on relapse in OCD. Conditions of treatment delivery, duration and monitoring will be equivalent across all groups. Both treatments are manualized and any newly engaged therapists will receive intensive training in one therapy protocol to ensure optimal delivery of each modality.||The objective of the present study is to establish IBCT as a psychological treatment that is as effective as ERP, but significantly more tolerable and generalizable for the high proportion of patients who are unable to benefit from ERP.||The hypotheses is IBCT is non-inferior to ERP; IBCT is superior to ERP among OCD patients with high levels of OVI and IBCT is more tolerable than ERP with lower rates of treatment refusal, drop-out and higher levels of treatment satisfaction in comparison to ERP.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT04335175,"Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1% of school-aged children, with one-third of patients suffering persistent tics into adulthood. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common comorbidity with TS. Individuals with either TS or OCD frequently exhibit sensory dysregulation, manifesting as heightened awareness of internal and external stimuli. For patients with OCD, sensory dysregulation has been linked to obsessive-compulsive symptoms and is an important consideration in treatment strategies. Sensory dysregulation remains largely unexplored in TS, but preliminary data suggests it is dissociable from tics, linked with obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and associated with poorer quality of life (QOL). This study seeks to address two key questions related to sensory dysregulation in TS and OCD: 1) Is sensory dysregulation in OCD clinically distinct from that in TS? 2) To what extent does sensory dysregulation affect QOL in each of these disorders? To do so, we will recruit patients with TS, patients with OCD, and healthy controls to complete an online battery of validated questionnaires assessing sensory dysregulation, psychiatric symptoms, and QOL. Addressing these knowledge gaps will enhance our understanding of bothersome sensory symptoms in TS and OCD, shed light on clinical overlap and/or distinctions between these commonly co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses, and clarify QOL impact and the potential need for more direct targeting of these symptoms.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT03184454,"The goal of this proposal is to provide therapy to patients with severe, treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by stimulating in two separate, but related, brain regions, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule and adjacent ventral striatum (VC/VS) with a novel Medtronic PC+S deep brain stimulation (DBS) system. While providing this DBS therapy, use of this new, recording-capable device will allow collection of data about brain activity in these two regions. This data will enable researchers to further elucidate the exact mechanisms of DBS therapy, as well as the neuropathophyisiology of OCD. This study aims to 1) gather evidence for corticostriatal changes in OCD in response to acute and chronic VC/VS DBS treatment and 2) specifically disrupt or enhance synchrony in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit.||Deep Brain stimulation involves bilateral stereotactic placement of stimulating ""leads"" into specific brain structures. Leads are attached to permanent subcutaneous wires and battery-powered implantable neurostimulators (INSs). Noninvasive INS programming can achieve a balance between maximal benefit (reduction in disabling OCD symptoms), while minimizing adverse effects (eg sensorimotor effects such as dysarthria or paresthesias; as well as behavioral side effects, e.g., hypomania, insomnia, or increased anxiety). HDE approval was granted in February 2009, and IDE approval was granted in February 2016. Multiple hospitals around the country have established HDE protocols to implant patients with intractable OCD who have failed conventional therapies, and some hospitals, like us, have obtained Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval to conduct pilot clinical trials. The existing model of DBS for OCD only addresses one aspect of the brain circuit implicated in the CSTC circuit, the VC/VS target. Therapy with this device, under this protocol, will also be able to provide stimulation to the cortical part of this circuit. Single-site VC/VS DBS may not adequately target the putative circuit. If OCD symptoms do arise from CSTC loop dysfunction, this implies that the problem is one of improper information flow between connected brain areas. Thus, modifying circuit activity may require coordinated intervention at multiple points to effectively synchronize or de-synchronize the full loop. Stimulation that specifically interrupts reverberant activity between prefrontal cortex and striatum will be superior to VC/VS DBS alone at relieving symptoms of OCD. We will test this by simultaneously implanting stimulating/recording electrodes at both VC/VS and a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) target bilaterally.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT03894085,"Previous studies suggest that there are brain anatomical and functional in patients with anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

NCT03638791,"Background:||Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a highly debilitating disorder with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2% is equally distributed among men and women. OCD generally starts at an early age and usually develops a chronic course if left untreated. Many patients with OCD receive treatment after years of delay due to both patient and health care factors; therefore, OCD affects educational achievement, ability to work and interpersonal relationships. Moreover, it poses a considerable burden and distress to family caregivers [1], and accounts for one of the ten most disabling mental health conditions worldwide [2].||The role of the microbial community in health and disease has been a neglected subject in human research until recently, despite the fact that human microbes comprise about 1-3 % of our body mass [3]. Gut microbes play important roles in nutrient metabolism, production of vitamins, and prevention of pathogens from colonizing our intestine [4]. Recently, microbiota in the gut has gained increasing interest due the extensive connection between the gut and the brain [5]. The bidirectional communication through neural, hormonal, and immunological signaling involving the central, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems forms the microbiome-gut-brain axis [6]. Skin microbiota is highly diverse and a number of factors affect bacterial composition, including sex, handedness, and time since last hand washing [7, 8]. In psychiatry, dysbioses have been reported in anorexia nervosa, major depression, autism, and other major psychiatric disorders [9, 10].||Association between OCD onset and infection has long been known. PANS/PANDAS are acute-onset forms of OCD associated with autoimmune reactions from pathogens such as streptococcus infection [11, 12]. The connection between bacterial pathogen and immunological response, which generates OCD symptoms, is further evidence for the importance of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in OCD. Lately, there have been numerous hypotheses regarding the importance of gut microbiome and OCD symptoms [13, 14]. However, neither skin nor gut microbial composition have ever been studied in OCD patients. Especially given the centrality of washing and cleaning in OCD, the study of skin and gut microbiota in OCD is a logical next step.||Aim 1. Characterize composition and diversity of the gut microbiome in individuals with OCD, OCD with washing compulsion and healthy controls.||We hypothesize that OCD patients will show evidence of gut dysbiosis (imbalance) marked by lower microbial diversity and specific taxonomic and gene content differences compared to healthy controls. Primary outcome is α-diversity, which refers to the number of species (richness) at one site. Secondary outcome is β-diversity, which refers to the differences in species composition between participants and taxonomic abundance of bacterial groups (at the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels). These measures yield information about individual microbial composition at each site and homogeneity in a group of people.|We hypothesize that reduced α and β diversity in gut microbiome correlate with severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms measured by Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), and Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory Revised (OCI-R). We predict that greater symptom severity is associated with lower diversity. A significant negative correlation will be supportive evidence for the microbiome-gut-brain axis.|We hypothesize that there will be significant richer α diversity in gut microbiome composition after successful psychotherapy (change in Y-BOCS score).||Aim 2. Characterize composition and diversity on the skin (palm and forehead) on patients with OCD, OCD with primary washing compulsion and healthy controls.||We hypothesize that OCD patients with washing compulsion will show evidence of a skin dysbiosis marked by lower microbial α and β diversity and specific taxonomic and gene content differences.|Disrupted microbial diversity and abundance from the skin will correlate with time spent on washing and properties of the skin surface documented by high definition photography.|Individuals with washing contamination that cease washing more than one hour per day will reacquire normal skin flora, which more closely will resemble healthy controls. This would provide important information regarding the plasticity of the skin microbiome. Moreover, skin health will improve in terms of troubles with eczema or other skin diseases.||Method:||Recruitment: Healthy controls will be recruited through advertisement or included from previous studies with their consent. Male and female patients between 18-45 years of age from the OCD-clinic at Huddinge Hospital with a DSM-5 diagnosis of OCD and fear of contamination will be invited to participate. Age matched controls will be recruited who have no personal or family history of OCD.

Patients will collect two stool samples at the beginning of treatment and two at the end of treatment. Controls will collect two samples at one time point only. Participants will collect stool at home using convenient kits that will be sent to the KI biobank. Fecal microbial DNA will be isolated using a phenol chloroform extraction method combined with physical disruption of bacterial cells and a DNA clean-up kit (QiaAmp DNAstool minikit, Qiagen, CA).||Skin sampling procedure: All participants are asked not to wash their hands before sampling, preferably after a two hours ERP session with a psychologist. Time since last handwash will be registered as a covariat in the statistical analysis later on. The palm surface of both hands is swabbed separately with cotton tipped swabs moistured with solution of 0.15 NaCl and 0,1% Tween 20. The samples are subsequently placed in 15-ml polypropylene tubes and stored at -20 degrees Celsius for 72 hours before DNA extraction using Mobio UltraClean Plant DNA isolation Kit (Mobio Laboratories) [7].||Exposure and Respons Prevention therapy (ERP): an evidence-based psychotherapy administered by experienced psychologists, either individually, in groups, face-to-face or through internet. A minimum of five exposure and respons prevention sessions is required in order for it to be considered an ERP treatment.||Sample storage in biobank: All samples will be stored at Karolinska Institutets (KI) biobank. Application for biobank storage of samples is in progress according to rules and regulations.||Metagenomic sequencing: The investigators will use two approaches: sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics [21]. Whole-genome metagenome shotgun sequencing can provide functional information on which genes are present in the microbiota of patients. This method can also provide a more detailed taxonomical resolution that 16S rRNA sequencing.||16S metagenomic sequencing technique: DNA amplification of the V1-3 regions using forward primer (8f:5'-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3') and reverse primer (518r:5'-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3') by PCR. 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes will be performed on a Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX machine (Roche, Florence, SC, USA). Sequences that are less than 200 base pairs (bp) or greater than 1,000 bp in length, containing incorrect primer sequences, or containing more than one ambiguous base will be discarded. 16S rRNA sequence data generated will be processed by the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) pipeline. Sequences are clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs; similar to species level) based on their sequence similarity at a 97% threshold using BLAST and assigned taxonomy using the Greengenes database. Principal coordinates (PCs) will be generated using unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances.||Metagenomic shotgun sequencing: will be prepared and sequenced at the CTMR under the direction of Prof Engstrand and Dr Schuppe-Koistinen. Sequencing will be performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform in High Output Mode. To efficiently utilize the flow cells, about ten samples will be multiplexed, with dual indices, per lane of the flow cell. Prior to downstream bioinformatics analysis, raw sequence data will be quality filtered and trimmed to remove bases with Phred quality scores less than 20.||Statistical analysis: Downstream bioinformatics analysis will consist of: i) taxonomic composition estimation to identify what microorganisms are present in the samples at strain-level resolution [ConStrains, kraken, metaphlan2]; ii) functional annotation and profiling using both reference gene catalog-based methods and hidden Markov model-based gene family approaches to determine microbial gene content and abundances [concoct, mocat2], including determination of the antibiotic resistance potential (antibiotic resistome); and iii) computing descriptive statistics and identifying groups within the data, as well as performing statistical analyses between subgroups using additional metadata, where available [hirbin, stats]. Bioinformatics analyses will be performed on the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing's (SNIC) cluster computing resources at UPPMAX. Differences in alpha diversity (expressed as number of observed species and Chao-1 estimator), beta diversity (UniFrac distances), and taxa abundance of bacterial groups (at the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels) will be analyzed. Since response variables are not predicted to be normally distributed, non-parametric testing will be used.||Determination of sample size: As no previous studies have been conducted on OCD, the investigators consulted similar studies conducted on patients with depression and anorexia nervosa. All have included between 20-30 patients which was sufficiently large to detect significant differences in alpha and beta diversity. As this is an initial study on OCD and the investigators are conducting two samplings on two occasions for cases, the investigators anticipate that this will be an adequate sample size to indicate whether skin and intestinal dysbioses exist in OCD warranting a larger investigation.||Timeline: Ethical application has been approved",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00674219,"Several case reports and an open-label trial have reported efficacy of anti-glutamatergic medications for the treatment of OCD. In an open-label trial of riluzole, a glutamate release inhibitor, seven of 13 adult patients with OCD improved, and five were categorized as treatment responders. Another open trial found riluzole to be effective for four of six children with treatment-refractory OCD. N-acetylcysteine, an agent that likely attenuates glutamate neurotransmission, was effective as an augmentation in one patient with OCD. Two case reports described memantine treatment of OCD. Poyurovsky et al. reported improvement with memantine augmentation in one patient with treatment resistant OCD, while Pasquini and Biondi noted improvement in one OCD patient with checking compulsions but not in one with contamination obsessions. There have been no controlled or open-label trials of memantine in OCD reported thus far.||Few studies have examined the efficacy of anti-glutamatergic agents in GAD. In an open-label trial of riluzole treatment in 18 patients with GAD, twelve patients responded and eight achieved remission. A double-blind, controlled study found that LY354740, a metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGlu2/3) agonist, was significantly more effective than placebo for GAD. No studies of memantine in GAD have been reported thus far.

NCT01368510,"This study will characterize the neurochemical abnormalities in important brain circuits underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms and the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Identification of such metabolite biomarkers will provide an important foundation for translational clinical studies to maximize the ability of CBT to reduce symptoms and to design medications that target core features of the disease, which is particularly important for those who do not respond to, or have access to, CBT.||OCD is an often disabling and chronic psychiatric condition that affects approximately 2% of the world's population. Most patients respond only incompletely to current treatments and many do not respond at all. CBT, a form of psychotherapy, is one of the most effective treatments for OCD, yet its mechanism of action is not fully understood. The objective of this study is to use neuroimaging to understand how neurometabolite abnormalities in neural circuits relate to OCD symptoms, and how these are affected by CBT. In OCD, dysfunction is suspected in several subregions of the cingulate gyrus, a brain region involved in relevant neural circuits. This study will use magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to measure concentrations of brain metabolites, including glutamate (Glu), in the cingulate. Glu is an important excitatory neurotransmitter that is suspected to be disturbed in OCD. In this study, MRSI scans will be performed on 25 adult OCD patients before and after 4 weeks of daily CBT. They will be compared to 25 untreated healthy controls scanned 4 weeks apart. A third group of 25 OCD patients will be scanned before and after 4 weeks while on the waitlist, will then receive 4 weeks of CBT, and will be scanned a third time at its completion. The specific aims of this study are: 1) Determine if levels of the Glu in the ""emotional"" and ""cognitive"" subregions of the cingulate differ between OCD patients and controls; 2) Determine if Glu changes after CBT or waitlist in the OCD patients and if they change in the controls after simple passage of time; 3) Determine if there are relationships between Glu and clinical and neurocognitive symptoms of OCD before and after CBT.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT04685018,"Many compulsions displayed by obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients serve to protect against perceived threat and can, therefore, be conceptualized as 'avoidance responses'. Exposure treatment with response prevention (ET+RP) is aimed at exposing patients to their obsessive thoughts and perceived threats while preventing engagement in compulsive avoidant responses. This induces extinction of threat perception and fearful arousal and hence reduces the motivation to avoid. While successful in many patients, however, as much as 40% dropout during treatment or display persistent avoidance after ET+RP. There is a clear need for treatment improvement for these often highly disabled patients.||Improving ET+RP outcomes requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive excessive and persistent avoidance in OCD patients. Psychological theories ascribe an important role to the relief that follows avoidance when the anticipated threat is successfully averted. This positive feeling arguably functions as a reward to reinforce the foregoing avoidance actions. Indeed, fMRI studies have found that the neurocircuitry of relief overlaps with that of reward, including the ventral tegmental area, ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex. Here, the authors will test the hypothesis that excessive-persistent avoidance is linked to exaggerated activation of the relief circuitry in OCD patients. For that purpose, we will acquire functional brain images of OCD patients in an MRI scanner and compare to healthy participants, while they participate in a computer task that is designed to model avoidance learning and relief.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

Can D-cycloserine (DCS) enhance and stabilize the treatment-response in relapsed and non-responding OCD-patients? A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled national study."" Estimated start of inclusion is November 2015 and the inclusion period lasts for maximum 2 years. All participants are referred to the specialist health care and are pre-screen by the local OCD-team. Before inclusion, the patients will fill in a number of questionnaires on-line and all patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate. Before the patient signs the informed consent form the patients will receive written and oral information about the study as well as watch a video describing the trial and what participation will imply. Before the 4-day concentrated exposure based treatment (cET) starts, the patients will undergo a clinical assessment interview by the local OCD-team, and will watch another video describing the trial in detail. They will also be assessed by SCID-I (Structured Clinical Interview) for DSM 5 as well as Y-BOCS (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale) interview by independent and specially trained psychologists. The cET is delivered in an ""individual group format"" which implies that the patient: therapist-ratio is 1:1, and that the treatment is delivered in groups of minimum 3 and maximum 6 patients. All groups are led by a specially trained cET therapist, and the local therapists are experienced OCD-therapists who are familiar with the cET format. Day 1 of the treatment (3 h) consists of psychoeducation and planning of exposure tasks. Day 2 and day 3 (both 8 h + contact in the evening) consist of individually tailored and therapist assisted exposure with a number of relevant triggers in a diversity of settings. All exposures are based on the LEaning in Technique (LET), where the patients are trained to recognize when the urge to ritualize starts, and to actively approach the trigger by ""leaning into the anxiety"". The exposures are also designed to optimize learned inhibition. In addition to individual exposure training, the group meets three times throughout the day. Day 2 and Day 3 the patient will take study medication before the exposures start. The study medication is D-Cycloserine (DCS) 250 mg, DCS 100 mg or placebo. In the afternoon Day 3, the patients' relatives/ friends are invited to a 2 h lecture/ psychoeducation on OCD and the current treatment. Day 4 the focus is on ""lessons learnt"" as well as on planning / specifying exposure tasks for the coming three weeks. Before and during the cET the patient will record data electronically via CheckWare (an electronic case report form database). The patient will continue registration of obsessions and compulsions through 3 weeks post cET. One week after cET a post-assessment with Y-BOCS will be performed by the independent assessor.

NCT01061983,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating illness that affects between 2% and 3% of the adult population of the United States. People with OCD often experience persistent unwanted thoughts and carry out ritual-like behaviors to rid themselves of these obsessive thoughts. Additionally, OCD symptoms are usually tied with feelings of intense anxiety and functional impairment, making it important for people with OCD to seek effective treatment. Although there are currently many treatment options for OCD, including psychotherapy and medications such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, between 40% and 60%of people with OCD only partially respond, or do not respond at all, to these treatment methods. Given the large percentage of people who do not respond to aggressive conventional treatments, alternative options are necessary for people with treatment-resistant OCD. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a procedure that involves the se of thin wires to carry electric current to parts of the brain associated with producing OCD symptoms. DBS has been effectively and safely used to treat movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, and may be beneficial in reducing OCD symptom severity. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of DBS in treating people with severe and treatment-resistant OCD.||Study participation through follow-up will last up to 2 years. Participants will be allowed to remain on any pre-surgical medications or behavioral therapy programs throughout the study. Before surgery, all participants will undergo a series of initial tests and examinations that will include psychiatric, medical, and neuropsychological histories and examinations.||Implantation of the devices will be performed at a single session. The leads that are inserted into the anterior limb of each internal capsule, will be implanted under local anesthesia. On the day of the surgery, participants will have a metal frame fixed to their heads for support during surgery, and magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) will be used to determine the exact placement of the wires. An extension wire will pass from the scalp area to the subclavicular region and connect each electrode to a subcutaneous implanted pulse generator (IPG), which will be implanted under general anesthesia. After placement of the DBS system, the patient will be admitted to the hospital for overnight observation for possible complications. Postoperative evaluation will consist of physical and neurological examinations, postoperative CBC, electrolyte panel, x-rays of the head, neck, and chest, a standard shunt series to ensure the integrity of connections, and a head CT scan to monitor for possible postoperative intracranial hemorrhage.||Surgical implantation will be followed by a three-week period with no stimulation, and then an intensive five-day preliminary outpatient stimulation trial, followed by longer-term outpatient stimulation. All patients will follow the same sequence of test conditions. The initial DBS testing will be open, followed by three blocks of testing in which the patients and investigators administering rating scales will not be informed of the stimulation condition. These three blocks will in general be three months long, but may be longer or shorter depending on the stability of any clinical improvement, and the possible emergence of symptom worsening.

NCT01411774,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects 1-2% of children, runs a chronic course without treatment, and is associated with considerable functional impairment and poor quality of life. Although most patients with OCD respond to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or pharmacotherapy with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), a substantial number of youth remain symptomatic after receiving these therapies. Pharmacological interventions with SRIs are only moderately efficacious, rarely produce remission, may be accompanied by side effects, and may not be an acceptable intervention to some parents. Medication augmentation strategies such as atypical antipsychotics are often used in children with partial response but have concerning metabolic effects and no systematic supporting efficacy or safety data. Although CBT is the gold standard treatment for pediatric OCD, not all patients benefit and the availability of skilled therapists is quite limited. Thus, there is a critical need for interventions to optimize treatment outcome in pediatric OCD. The primary mechanism in CBT is repeated and prolonged exposure to feared situations while abstaining from OCD rituals. This treatment is based on animal models of extinction of conditioned fears. Basic research on the neural circuitry underlying fear extinction led to the examination of d-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at the NMDA receptor in the amygdala, as an agent capable of enhancing extinction learning. Following successful validation of this strategy in animals, six trials in adult humans - and one study in youth with OCD - provide support for DCS dosing as facilitating extinction learning that occurs during exposure-based psychotherapy. However, experts and agencies responsible for regulating drug indications in the US, including the FDA, recognize that safety and efficacy findings in adults should not be routinely extrapolated to children. The present study furthers pilot work on DCS to augment the effects of CBT in children with OCD. The investigators are conducting a double-blind randomized controlled trial, conducted at two sites, to examine the relative benefit of 10 psychotherapy sessions of which sessions 4-10 will be augmented with weight-adjusted doses of DCS (25/50mg) compared to CBT augmented with placebo. 150 youth (ages 7-17) with OCD will be randomly and evenly assigned to one of the two treatment conditions. The primary outcome will be change in OCD symptom severity assessed by independent evaluators. The study recruitment sites are the University of South Florida (USF) and Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School (MGH).

All patients scored 30 or higher in the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). They were considered as candidates to DBS for OCD by two independent psychiatrists. An independent psychiatric surgery committee composed of one neurosurgeon, one psychiatrist and one legal medicine expert agreed surgery indication was appropriate. All patients provided written informed consent. The study had approval from the Hospital Clínico San Carlos ethics committee.||Pre-surgical Neuroimaging Before surgery, all patients underwent 3T Siemens TRIO system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) MRI scanning. Patients also performed an OCD symptom provocation task during fMRI scanning using modified version of the MOCSS (Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Stimuli Set). During scanning, patients were presented with pictures of 4 classes of provocative stimuli, 50 of each type: 1) contamination/washing, 2) checking, 3) hoarding, 4) symmetry/order. The study comprised 4 'blocks' pertaining to the 4 classes of provocative stimuli. Each block consisted of ten 20-s alternating epochs in which subjects viewed either 10 provocative or 10 neutral pictures (see Supplementary material for a full description). Post-operative computed tomography (CT) scanning was used to determine correct electrode positioning.||Neurosurgical procedure The target was selected for the distal electrode contact (contact zero) to be placed at the NAcc close to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis: 1.5 mm rostral to the anterior border of the anterior commissure, 4 mm ventral to the AC-PC line and 7 mm lateral to the mid-sagittal plane. Then, the striatum was segmented using the deterministic DTI projections of the three subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex (ventromedial vmPFC, orbitofrontal OFC, dorsolateral DLPFC) plus the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). A trajectory was planned for placing the rest of the contacts of a Medtronic Model 3391 stimulating macroelectrode at several points along the striatum avoiding the ventricles in such a way that each of the electrode contacts (contacts 1, 2, and 3) was closest to each segment of the striatum corresponding to OFC, DLPFC and ACC.||Deep-Brain Stimulation Protocol After surgery, a random sequence of contact activations (0 [Nacc],1,2 and 3), including sham (-), was generated for each patient.

Stimulation contact was set following a random series known only by the neurosurgeon, with patient, psychiatry and neuropsychology teams blind. Psychiatric assessment was conducted each month, and neuropsychological testing was performed after each activation and washout period||Symptom-provocation fMRI analysis Functional imaging data were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM12; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) employing an epoch-related model. The main symptom(s) for each patient was defined and used to construct a contrast of responses to provocation vs. neutral pictures. The ensuing contrasts were masked with an inclusive prefrontal mask and the statistical parametric map thresholded at P < 0.001 uncorrected. Cluster extent was defined using AlphaSIM (threshold P < 0.05). Note that due to weak responses during symptom activation in patients 4 and 6, the SPMs for these patients were first thresholded at P < 0.01 and 0.005 uncorrected, respectively. After the clinical protocol had ended, the projections to the cortical activated areas on the MOCSS for each patient in their main symptomatic dimension from the striatum were calculated using probabilistic tractography. The connectivity between each of the contacts and the fMRI activations was calculated as the number of fibers of the projection of each contact (sphere of diameter 4 mm around the contact) to the cortical activated areas.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00748761,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) afflicts 2% to 4% of children and adolescents, who suffer from persistent, unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors. One of the most effective treatments of OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), yet researchers do not know how CBT affects the brain. In this study, brain scans will be performed to determine concentrations of several neurometabolites, which are chemicals involved in providing energy to the brain. Of particular importance are the neurometabolites glutamine and glutamate, which, in addition to providing energy to the brain, are among the most common excitatory neurotransmitters. Disruption of glutamine and glutamate is thought to be related to OCD. By examining where in the brain levels of glutamate and glutamine change, researchers will attempt to determine whether CBT modifies brain activity, whether a circuit targeted by researchers is affected by CBT, and how brain activity in people with OCD differs from that of people without the disorder in terms of the targeted circuit.||Children and adolescents ages 8 through 17 with OCD will be randomly assigned to either receive a 12-week CBT intervention or be placed on a waiting list for 8 weeks before receiving the 12-week intervention.

NCT01035242,"Association splitting is a new cognitive technique which aims at reducing obsessive thoughts. It draws upon the so-called ""fan effect"" of associative priming.

These patients have already undergone traditional cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention (ERP), as well as pharmacotherapy. Patients voice distress at their poor quality of life and high symptom burden, and can feel hopeless, if they have exhausted numerous evidence-based treatment options without significant improvement. Narrative therapy is a unique approach, based on the premise that language reflects a social construction of reality. Individuals with severe mental illness hold within themselves life narratives that reinforce their painful beliefs about themselves, the world, and others. Evidence indicates that narrative therapy can help to create a more cohesive identity and a more flexible view of the self and the future.||Our primary goal is to determine whether narrative therapy could improve OCD symptom burden and quality of life in a highly treatment-resistant population. Domains such as mood, identity, and interpersonal connectedness are secondary measures. The research questions are: could narrative therapy lead to symptomatic improvement in treatment-resistant OCD? And could narrative therapy improve the domains of mood, interpersonal connectedness, and/or identity in patients with treatment-resistant OCD?",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT00374348,"Symptoms of OCD is a rather common co-morbid condition in patients with Schizophrenia. Some studies suggest that obsessive-compulsive symptoms may be present in 7.8-46% of schizophrenic patients and who seem to be poorly responsive to drug therapy. The serotonergic medications in combination with cognitive-behavioral therapy stil remain the preferred treatment for OCD symptoms. There are controversial data regarding effect of neuroleptics on symptoms of OCD. It was noted that the use of Risperdone, Quatiapine and Clozapine might aggravate OCD symptoms. Serotonin antagonism of these neuroleptics is believed to exacerbate obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia. On the other hand, Pourovsky M. at(2000) reported three cases of Schizophrenia with symptoms of OCD successfully treated with Olanzapine.One of our patients with Schizophrenia and co-morbid symptoms of OCD who was unsuccessfully treated with various neuroleptics in combination with anti-obsessive agents,demonstrated significant improvement in both Schizophrenic and obsessive compulsive symptoms after she was switched to Aripiprazole.

NCT00257361,"Exposure and response prevention (ERP) has proven efficacy for OCD treatment in adults. Yet, ERP does not help all individuals, and those who benefit often remain somewhat symptomatic. Behavioral models for OCD treatment are based on two components. First, fears are acquired by the development of an association between a neutral stimulus and an aversive stimulus such the former acquires the aversive properties of the latter. The neutral stimulus is then designated as a conditioned stimulus (CS), and the original aversive stimulus is called an unconditioned stimulus (UCS). Second, the acquired fears can be unlearned through presentation of the CS in the absence of the UCS, a process known as extinction. On a neural level, ERP incorporates similar mechanisms to those involved in fear conditioning. Antagonists at the glutamatergic NMDA receptor, which is involved in learning and memory, block both fear learning and extinction. D-Cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor subtype, augments learning in animals and humans. Clinical application in animals and humans suggest that DCS facilitates the fear extinction process when taken prior to exposure to feared stimuli. An initial trial in acrophobic adults provided support for acute DCS dosing as facilitating extinction to fear. Given that ERP is based on extinction, it follows that DCS may augment ERP therapy providing enhanced treatment effects. With this in mind, we propose to undertake an initial study of DCS to determine whether it has any short-term clinical benefits when added to standard ERP therapy in adults with OCD.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

Stimulation parameters will be 1-Hz, 10 seconds per train, 10 pulses per train (3 seconds inter-train interval) for a total of 160 trains (1600 pulses/session) at 130% of resting motor threshold (MT) (using the lowest value of the dominant hemisphere), once a day, 5 day/week, for 3 weeks. The coil will be positioned over the pre-SMA, targeted using the International 10-20 EEG System (Choi et al. 2006). Pre-SMA is defined at 15% of the distance between inion and nasion anterior to Cz (vertex) on the sagittal midline. The coil will be placed with the handle along the sagittal midline, pointing towards the occiput to stimulate bilaterally and simultaneously the pre-SMA.||Sham rTMS procedures Sham TMS will be administered by tilting the coil 90° off the scalp, with one wing of the coil touching the scalp (Lisamby et al., 2001). This sham-TMS approach produces a clicking sound that is very similar to an active TMS pulse and induces a voltage in the brain that is more than 75% lower than active TMS (Lisanby et al., 2001).||Motor Threshold Resting MT will be defined as the minimum magnetic flux needed to elicit a threshold EMG response (50 mV in peak-to-peak amplitude) in a resting target muscle (abductor pollicis brevis) in 5/10 trials using single-pulse TMS administered to the contralateral primary motor cortex. The motor threshold will be re-assessed every session before starting the rTMS treatment.||Side-effect ratings Before and after each session patients were asked by a blinded assessor a series of questions in a structured form in order to rate TMS side-effects. For this purpose we will use the Monitoring of Side Effects Scale (MOSES).||Clinical assessment After a screening visit, the patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be assessed before entry the study with a comprehensive clinical interview (age, sex, education, OCD onset, OCD subtype, duration of the illness, history of past or current TICs, previews pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, treatment resistance, lifetime comorbidities) and a psychometric assessment including the following tools: The SCID-5 CV (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders-Clinician Version), the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), the Y-BOCS-SC (symptoms checklist) (Goodman et al., 1989a,b), the Hamilton Anxiety rating Scale (HAM-A) (Hamilton, 1959), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17 itemes) (Hamilton, 1967) and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) (Guy, 2000).||Before starting the rTMS procedures and after 10 and 15 sessions all patients will be assessed by a blinded assessor with the following psychometric scale: Y-BOCS, HAM-D, HAM-A, CGI-S and the CGI-I.

NCT00251303,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by the presence of intrusive and unwanted obsessional thoughts and images and of compulsive behaviors. Its presentation during childhood is similar to that seen in adulthood, except that children sometimes lack insight into the senselessness of the thoughts and behaviors. Although many patients benefit from treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a significant proportion have limited or no response to these medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may also be effective for OCD, alone or in combination with SSRIs, but there is a shortage of qualified therapists, and many patients and families cannot participate effectively in the therapy.||There is a pressing need, then, for the development of alternative, novel treatments for pediatric OCD. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging data suggest that OCD may arise from dysfunction of orbitofronto-striato-thalamocortical circuitry. Glutamate plays a crucial role in the regulation of excitatory activity within this circuit and may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of OCD. If so, then agents which reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission may provide unique antiobsessional benefits. Riluzole is a medication that reduces glutamatergic activity. A small open-label trial suggested that it might reduce OCD severity among children and adolescents.||The investigation will enroll up to 80 pediatric subjects with OCD including some who have both autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and OCD. The subjects will participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial of riluzole as a sole agent or as an augmentation to their currently inadequate therapy. Following the double-blind portion of the trial, subjects may receive three months of open-label treatment with riluzole, if it is clinically indicated.

NCT01194076,"Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective intervention for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many people do not receive CBT initially due, in part, to the lack of trained providers and geographic barriers (e.g., distance to such providers). Rather, the majority of youth with OCD receive psychiatric medication alone or together with unproven forms of psychotherapy. While some serotonergic medications have demonstrated utility in pediatric OCD, side effects can be common, response rates are modest at best, and symptom remission is rare. Storch et al. have shown that CBT can be delivered effectively in an intensive format over a 3-week time-span; however, even this shortened treatment approach involves considerable time and financial expenditure for those who do not have local access to CBT, including three week's time off from work and the cost of local room and board. Given this, more efficient ways of providing CBT need to be identified and tested to increase the number of people with access to this form of treatment. With this in mind, the proposed feasibility study examines the use of videophone technology to evaluate a 5-day cognitive-behavioral intervention for youth with OCD administered at multiple sites. A total of 30 youth will receive 10 60-75-minute sessions of CBT over 5 days (two sessions a day). Cognitive-behavioral therapy will be based on a demonstrated effective treatment protocol, and adapted for administration over a one-week time-span. We will utilize a month-long waitlist control to estimate treatment efficacy. Comprehensive assessments will be conducted by trained clinicians at relevant time-points (i.e., baseline, post-waitlist, post-treatment, follow-up) to assess symptom severity and impairment.

NCT01596608,"Although ECT is effective against severe depression, psychosis, and OCD, it also produces significant impairments of autobiographical memory and other cognitive functions. These side effects limit the acceptability and tolerability of ECT in many patient populations. They also limit the number of treatments that can be administered in a course of ECT, leading to high relapse rates once ECT is discontinued. In animal studies, MST has been shown to have far fewer adverse cognitive effects than ECT. In small human studies, humans have shown faster subjective and objective recovery of orientation after MST than with ECT. However, the precise degree of cognitive sparing in MST versus ECT has yet to be established. Likewise, the comparative efficacy of MST versus ECT in severe depression, schizophrenia, and OCD remains to be seen. The investigators aim to determine whether MST spares autobiographical memory and other cognitive functions, while retaining comparable efficacy to that of ECT.||Objective 1: To compare the efficacy of MST and ECT in treating patients with severe depression, schizophrenia, and OCD.||Hypothesis 1: MST will have equivalent efficacy to ECT on objective measures of mood, schizophrenia, and OCD symptoms.||Objective 2: To compare the effects of MST and ECT on autobiographical memory and other cognitive functions in patients with severe depression, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and OCD.||Hypothesis 2: MST will have significantly lower adverse effects on objective measures of autobiographical memory and other cognitive functions in patients with severe depression, schizophrenia, and OCD.||Objective 3: To compare the changes in brain function that result from MST and ECT.||Hypothesis 3: Both MST and ECT will produce changes in functional brain activity consistent with antidepressant response, antipsychotic response, and antiobsessive response, along with a sparing of cognitive functions.||The discovery of a viable alternative to ECT, with equivalent efficacy but fewer side effects, would have a transformative effect on the treatment of several forms of severe mental illness. At present, many patients who could benefit from ECT do not pursue this treatment due to concerns about cognitive side effects, as well as the enduring social stigma of ECT itself. In addition, many patients who have benefited from ECT are obliged to discontinue this effective treatment because of mounting cognitive side effects; high rates of relapse then ensue.||If MST could be shown to spare autobiographical memory and other forms of cognition, many more patients would be willing to take advantage of the treatment.

NCT00533806,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder that affects approximately 1 in 200 children. Although feelings of anxiety, fear, and uncertainty are a normal part of life and growing up, for some children these feelings and emotions become chronic, relentless, and progressively worse if left untreated. OCD is characterized by obsessions, or repeated unsettling thoughts, causing a person to perform repeated actions called compulsions. Children are typically not diagnosed with OCD until they are between the ages of 8 and 12, leaving many young children undiagnosed. Additionally, no psychotherapy treatments have been designed for young children who are under the age of 8 and have OCD. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a family-based treatment program for children, ages 5 to 8, who have been diagnosed with OCD.||Participants in this open-label study will be randomly assigned to receive either cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or relaxation therapy for 12 sessions over a period of 14 weeks.

NCT03343106,"BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE.||The most effective psychological treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), which entails confronting obsessional triggers (i.e., exposure) and resisting urges to ritualize (response prevention). Although successful, these techniques are challenging and provoke high levels of anxiety. This may contribute to the fact that between 25% and 50% of patients with access to ERP refuse treatment, drop out prematurely, or do not adhere to the treatment instructions and show attenuated response. Given the effectiveness of ERP techniques, developing ways to make them more tolerable and increase patient adherence, while not compromising therapeutic integrity, is an important next step in OCD treatment research. Recent investigations have addressed whether adding medications, cognitive therapy, or motivational Interviewing to ERP improves outcome and adherence; yet to date, no consensus has emerged regarding the degree to which these combination treatments are more effective than ERP monotherapy. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which has recently been studied for OCD, offers new hope for addressing the tolerability and adherence issues with ERP. Specifically, ACT uses acceptance and mindfulness processes to foster a willingness to experience unwanted inner experiences (e.g., obsessional thoughts, anxiety). These acceptance and mindfulness processes are consistent with ERP, but they are hypothesized to increase engagement in exposure exercises beyond ERP alone. There is evidence for this claim from a randomized trial which demonstrated that ACT, without in-session exposure, had clinical response rates in the 55-65% range at posttreatment and three month follow-up using an intent to treat analysis. Additionally, drop-out and refusal rates were low at 12.2% and treatment acceptability at posttreatment was near the maximum on the scale 4.3 out of 5. In this study, for experimental reasons, ACT did not include in-session ERP. However, the most theoretically and practically consistent use of ACT for OCD is as a context from which to conduct exposure therapy or ERP. While ACT focuses on processes (e.g., acceptance, defusion, values) that are distinct from those involved in ERP (e.g., habituation, cognitive change), an important goal of both treatments is to broaden the patient's engagement with feared stimuli. In fact, ACT procedures have been shown to increase involvement in difficult activities, including participating in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders and willingness to experience unwanted obsessive thoughts. Thus, building ACT techniques into ERP is likely to help patients (a) engage in ERP tasks, (b) confront high levels of anxiety without using escape/avoidance strategies, and (c) resist rituals. The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate whether integrating ACT increases the acceptability, tolerability, and adherence with ERP techniques relative to ERP without ACT.||STUDY DESIGN AND HYPOTHESES.||Fifty-eight adults with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) received 16 twice-weekly sessions (2 hours per session) of either ERP with the inclusion of ACT techniques (ERP+ACT; n = 30) or ERP alone (n = 28). Assessments using interviews, self-report questionnaires, and behavioral observations were conducted at pre- and post-test, and at 6 month follow-up. Specific hypotheses were: 1) Patients receiving ERP+ACT will report greater treatment acceptability, and show higher quantity and quality of completed self-directed ERP assignments, relative to patients receiving standard ERP; 2) Both ERP and ERP+ACT will lead to clinically significant reductions in OCD symptoms from pre- to post-test and from pre-test to follow-up.||METHODS||3a. Sample Size and Recruitment. The investigators aimed for an intent-to-treat sample of 60 adults across two sites: The Center for Clinical Research at Utah State University (USU) and the Anxiety and Stress Disorders Clinic at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC). Patients were recruited via advertisement of the study and via referrals from primary care and mental health providers familiar with the treatment centers. The USU Center (Twohig) and the UNC Clinic (Abramowitz) are well known research-oriented treatment clinics in their regions. USU is within a 1:30 minute drive of two million people and travel for treatment is common given the rural nature of the area. Also, no other known entity recruits participants with OCD in this area. The Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area of NC is home to over one million people, and the UNC Clinic receives a steady stream of inquiries for treatment. Patient advocacy groups and associations that post research trials on the Internet were contacted to further publicize the study.||3b. Establishing Diagnoses. All diagnoses were established by trained interviewers using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).||3c. Randomization to Treatment Groups. Subsequent to screening, 30 individuals were randomly assigned (using a random number generator) to receive ERP+ACT and 28 to receive ERP monotherapy. With the exception of the inclusion of ACT techniques in the ERP+ACT condition, treatment was identical across the two groups (i.e., the number and duration of exposure sessions were the same).||3d. Treatments. ERP. ERP treatment was manualized based on Kozak and Foa's protocol and included 16 twice-weekly 120 minute sessions. Therapists were advanced graduate students who had received extensive training from experts in ERP and ACT for OCD. Sessions 1 and 2 included information-gathering, psychoeducation, presentation of the rationale for ERP, and introduction to self-monitoring of rituals. Session 3 was dedicated to developing the treatment plan (exposure hierarchy, response prevention plan). Sessions 4-15 included in-session prolonged and repeated gradual exposure therapy, informal discussion of mistaken cognitions, daily exposure homework assignments, and instructions to refrain from rituals (response prevention in session and between sessions), along with self monitoring of any rituals that were performed. Session 16 addressed discontinuation and relapse prevention.||ACT+ERP. This condition matched the ERP condition in terms of the number and duration of exposure sessions. Sessions 1 and 2 involved an abbreviated discussion of the ACT model of ERP focusing on acceptance of obsessions and anxiety, just noticing and not acting on obsessions, being present with one's internal experiences, and linking therapy to one's values. Session 3 involved the development of an exposure hierarchy and response prevention plan, and explaining the ACT-based approach to ERP which focuses on learning flexible responding in the presence of obsessions, anxiety, and urges to ritualize. The exposure exercises were procedurally similar to ERP but focused on the facilitation of ACT processes. For example, the therapist might teach just noticing of obsessions by exposing the participant to the feared stimulus and asking the participant to watch the obsessional thoughts pass by as if they were leaves floating on a stream. Homework exposure practice was linked to the patient's goals and values, and participants were instructed to practice ACT processes during these assignments. Session 16 covered an ACT-based model of relapse prevention focusing on following one's values in the presence of obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges.||3e. Standardization and Integrity Procedures. All assessors and therapists were trained to competency in their duties by Drs. Twohig and Abramowitz. All assessment and treatment sessions were videotaped and a random selection of 20% of tapes were reviewed by the investigators and scored for integrity of implementation. Drs. Twohig and Abramowitz also served as supervisors on the project. Cross-site data and video sharing of supervision occurred via the Internet in a HIPAA-compliant manner and weekly meetings occurred via Skype.||3f. Length of Study. The length of the study was 6 years. The investigators developed the ERP+ACT treatment manual during the first two months of the study period. Following this, the investigators completed recruitment and treatment of all patients between the 1st and 6th years. This left the final 1 year for follow-up data collection, data analysis, and for writing up and presenting the results.||3g. Statistical Methods. The investigators will use the following procedures to address each hypotheses: 1) Between-groups t-tests to examine differences on measures of treatment acceptability and the quantity and quality of adherence to ERP assignments at post-treatment. Corresponding effect sizes will be computed to examine the magnitude of this effect. 2) Within-group t-tests to determine the statistical significance of pre-posttest and pretest-follow-up differences on outcome measures. Corresponding within-group effect sizes will also be computed to examine the magnitude of these differences. Further, the methods described by Jacobson & Truax to examine the extent of clinically significant and reliable change from pre to posttest and at follow-up will be utilized.||3h. Power Analyses. Power calculations were based on the average within-group effect size of 1.41 reported in a meta-analysis of CBT for OCD. This effect size was derived from clinical interview measures (e.g., the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale). A sample size of 60 affords greater than 90% power to detect a similar effect size with a t-test in the present study if alpha is set at .05. There are no available studies comparing treatment adherence and quality of life between two active psychological treatments for OCD from which to calculate power estimates. The investigators will therefore examine effect sizes in addition to significance levels when comparing between ERP+ACT and ERP on these variables.||4. INTENDED USE OF THE RESULTS||The results from the present study will be published and disseminated through conference presentations. They will also be used as pilot data to apply for NIMH funding for a larger study using the R34 mechanism (treatment development).",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

All encrypted backups are kept in the S3 storage that is dedicated to Queen's University, located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.||Data Analysis: Initially, all data will be examined for missing, nonsensical, and outlying variables. Missing data will be treated as missing and not imputed (will be analyzed on a per-protocol basis). Given the likelihood of participant drop-out or withdrawal, the investigators have purposely over-sampled the study groups to obtain meaningful and statistically significant results at the end of the study. Based on previous experience with CBT and e-CBT in similar patient populations, it is anticipated that up to 30% drop-out by the end of the e-CBT or group therapy phases. Using the PHQ-9 as the primary outcome, a 30% change is considered clinically significant. Therefore, a sample size of 100 participants in each arm of the study would be sufficient for detecting significant results with p = 0.05, and a power of 0.95. Questionnaire data collection will occur at four separate time points; pre-intervention (baseline), in the middle of the study (week 8), post-intervention (week 16), and at a 6-month follow-up. fMRI data collection will pre-intervention (baseline) and post-intervention (week 16). Using Mann-Whitney-U tests, baseline demographic data from individuals who drop out will be compared to those who finish identifying any fundamental differences between completers and non-completers. Linear regression analysis (for continuous outcomes) and binomial regression analysis (for categorical outcomes), will be used to identify variables associated with the two outcome measures over the three measurement time points while controlling for demographic variables, such as age and gender, and to compare the differences between the study arms.||Other quantitative measures will be gathered by extrapolating recorded information directly through the OPTT application (number of logins per day, amount of time spent logged in, etc.). Qualitative measure analyses will aid in the inquiry of the role of personal, social, and cultural factors in enabling or constraining the use of OPTT. Findings will identify factors related to the utility, feasibility, and accessibility of OPTT from the perspectives of users and providers. Interpretive qualitative methods are ideal for gathering in-depth descriptions of user experience and meaning. An Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach will guide data collection and analysis.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT01409642,"Pediatric Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is among the most common disorders of childhood, affecting between 1 and 3% of the youth population. The disorder is associated with substantial impairment in academic, social, and family functioning, and it carries a host of risks as youth age into adulthood. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has emerged as the treatment of choice for pediatric OCD, with typical treatment protocols involving exposure to feared stimuli, identification and evaluation of maladaptive beliefs, relaxation training, and behavioral rewards. Although these techniques have produced favorable results, one third of youth with OCD do not demonstrate significant response to treatment and many of those who do respond continue to evidence some degree of symptoms and impairment.||Efforts to improve therapy outcomes for youth with OCD increasingly have attempted to augment individual CBT with greater family involvement. These programs typically involve psychoeducation about OCD as well as general behavioral strategies for enhancing adherence to treatment. Although current family-focused treatments vary with regard to the nature and extent of parent involvement, to date, the incremental benefit of adding a family treatment component to traditional individual treatment remains unclear. Indeed, there does not appear to be a relation between the degree of family involvement and degree of treatment response, and current family treatments do not appear to affect change in family beliefs or behaviors.||This picture suggests that either family involvement does not contribute to significant improvement in child outcomes or that current treatments may not be sufficiently focused on features of the home environment that are relevant for shaping and maintaining OCD symptoms. Building from theoretical literature which identifies familial blame and accommodation as key characteristics that are important for course and outcome in OCD, we have developed a novel family intervention for use in treating pediatric OCD. Using techniques that are well established, Positive-Family Interaction Therapy (P-FIT) attempts to reduce family blame, accommodation, and conflict and to enhance family cohesion in high stress, high conflict families.||The goals of this study are to investigate a manualized P-FIT program for youth with OCD first with a small open trial of up to ten families to investigate the feasibility and tolerability of the treatment and then with a randomized trial (the main study) to assess its incremental efficacy over usual care (i.e., individual cognitive behavioral therapy). For the initial pilot stage, up to four children between the ages of 9-17 will be treated with P-FIT through the UCLA Child OCD, Anxiety, and Tic Disorders Program after completing a diagnostic evaluation to confirm eligibility. During this pilot study, procedures and materials for the manual will be refined and finalized for the controlled trial. The treatment will consist of 12 sessions of standard cognitive behavioral therapy that is augmented with a novel 6-session family focused treatment module. Assessments involving interviews, questionnaires, and several short tasks will be conducted at the beginning, midpoint and end of the treatment. We will also follow up with families 3 months following treatment in order to assess durability of any treatment gains. Study staff will meet weekly to discuss each open trial therapy session, including the feasibility, efficacy, and acceptability of the treatment manual, and make adjustments as needed. Once this group reaches consensus regarding the suitability of the manual, recruitment into the open trial will end and subsequent eligible families will be invited to participate in the randomized controlled trial (the main study).||Over the course of the main study, 40 youngsters will be randomized to receive either individual child-centered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) or the P-FIT intervention (ICBT + 6 sessions of family treatment). All subjects regardless of response status will be evaluated at all scheduled assessment points. In addition to comprehensive parent, child, and clinician reports, the primary outcome variables will be assessed by blind independent evaluators. Manualized intervention and assessment protocols plus state-of-the art quality assurance (i.e., weekly supervision with an expert clinician specializing specifically in OCD treatment) and adverse event monitoring procedures will insure participant safety. Results from this investigation will be used to support a larger controlled comparative trial comparing the degree to which P-FIT improves outcomes for youth with OCD above and beyond current available treatments.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT02911324,"The two first-line treatments for OCD are a class of medications called serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and a type of cognitive behavioral therapy called exposure and response prevention (EX/RP). But more than a third of patients with OCD do not respond to these treatments, and less then half become well. Thus, new treatment approaches are needed.||EX/RP is thought to involve fear extinction learning. Recent research suggests that modulators of the endocannabinoid system such as nabilone (a synthetic cannabinoid and agonist of the cannabinoid 1 receptor, CB1R) may enhance fear extinction learning and therefor could enhance EX/RP. However, nabilone could also work via modulating activity in cortico-striatal circuits, which contain high concentrations of CB1R, and thereby might reduce repetitive behaviors like compulsions seen in OCD.||To test both ideas, we will conduct a small pilot randomized trial to explore the effects of nabilone on its own for 4 weeks, vs. combined with EX/RP, in adult patients with OCD. This proof-of-concept study will investigate whether nabilone administration is feasible and well-tolerated in adult patients with OCD.

NCT02685280,"BACKGROUND||Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder [OCD] is a psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 2% which is mainly characterized by obsessional ideas and compulsive behaviours and rituals. Many patients show improvement under cognitive behavioural and/or pharmacological treatment. A minority of patients is refractory to all available therapy and may benefit from capsulotomy1.||From 1999 onwards, Deep Brain Stimulation [DBS] has been proposed as an alternative to capsulotomy in refractory cases of OCD (2,3). In Belgium, there is currently a reimbursement for devices for DBS for OCD, but not for rechargeable neurostimulators, in these OCD patients.||STUDY RATIONALE||Some patients with DBS for OCD need very frequent replacements of their neurostimulators (Medtronic Synergy 7427 ® [Synergy], Medtronic Kinetra 7428 ® [Kinetra] , Medtronic Activa PC 37601 ® [Activa PC] ), due to end-of-life of the batteries. This results in frequent re-interventions, probably causing discomfort for the patient, wound problems and infections due to revision surgery scar tissue, hardware problems and increasing costs for the public health system (consultations, hardware devices, surgery and its complications).||A new type of neurostimulators with an externally rechargeable battery has been developed recently. The manufacturer estimates the longevity of these devices to be 9 years. These products are in conformity with the essential requirements of Directive 1999/5/EC on Radio and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment and Directive 90/385/EEC on Active Implantable Medical Devices. Currently they have a CE mark only for the indication of DBS for Parkinson's Disease and Essential Tremor, but not for DBS for psychiatric disorders such as OCD. Therefore, up till now they cannot be used in patients treated with DBS for OCD.||Therefore, this physician-initiated study is trying to investigate whether the use of this new rechargeable neurostimulator is effective and safe in DBS treated OCD patients.||HYPOTHESIS||The hypothesis of the present study is that the implantation and use of rechargeable neurostimulators in OCD patients treated with DBS is (1) effective, (2) applicable, (3) safe and (4) decreases the need of neurostimulator replacement.||OBJECTIVES||To prove the hypothesis, the following objectives are aimed in our study:||Efficacy:||-To test whether DBS using rechargeable neurostimulators is effective on psychiatric symptoms as compared to DBS using non-rechargeable neurostimulators in these patients.||Applicability:||-To investigate whether this specific patient population is capable of recharging the rechargeable neurostimulators properly.||Safety:||-To document possible side effects of DBS for OCD using rechargeable neurostimulators.||Capability of diminishing the need of neurostimulator replacement:||-To investigate whether discomfort and risks of the frequent neurostimulator replacements due to battery end-of-life can be diminished by the use of the rechargeable neurostimulators.||STUDY DESIGN||At the Neurosurgery and Psychiatry consultation, eligible patients are informed about the present study. As soon as informed consent is obtained, the next time the battery of the non-rechargeable neurostimulator reaches its end-of-life and elective replacement is planned, a rechargeable neurostimulator and (if needed) the extension leads adaptors necessary to connect these neurostimulators with the existing extension leads will be implanted instead of a new non-rechargeable neurostimulator.||After informed consent is obtained, at every consultation before and after implantation of the rechargeable neurostimulator the parameters as stated in the primary and secondary endpoints' sections will be recorded.||TRIAL INTERVENTION||The main trial intervention of this study will be the implantation of one rechargeable neurostimulator instead of the currently used non-rechargeable neurostimulator(s) and surgical closure of one of the existing abdominal wall cavities (the so-called ""pockets""). It may be necessary to tunnel the extension cable from one side to another within the thoracic or abdominal wall. Thereby, we may provoke extension cable loops which may provoke undesirable stimulation when passing through a magnetic field. However this risk seems smaller than the risk of dissecting the electrode and replacing the extension cable to the other side.||This intervention can be done under general or local anaesthetics.||ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING||All adverse events are noted before and after implantation of the rechargeable neurostimulator.||Below is a list of possible adverse events with both non-rechargeable and rechargeable neurostimulators for DBS in OCD:||Early and late surgery and anaesthesia related problems||A ""pulling"" experience at the level of the implanted neurostimulator and extension cables|Postoperative pain and discomfort|Displacement of the neurostimulator|Erosion of the skin superficial to the implanted hardware|Allergic reaction or rejection towards the implanted hardware|Wound infection and infection of the implanted hardware|Swelling or hematoma in the region of implantation|Pain, itching or discomfort at incision/implant sites|Death||Hardware and directly stimulation-related problems||Hardware failure (e.g. breakage or isolation damage of a cable, neurostimulator failure…)|Unwanted spontaneous reset of the neurostimulator|Fluctuating results|Early end-of-life (less than expected) of the battery of the neurostimulator|Playing with patient programmer|Shocking or jolting stimulation|Exceeding of the upper limit of current that is passed through the DBS system, as indicated by the manufacturer, that in extreme circumstances might lead to a biological effect at the tip of the electrode that is comparable to capsulotomy|Electromagnetic interference might lead to dysfunction of the DBS system and in extreme circumstances even to death (e.g. during MRI scanning)||Motor and movement problems||Teeth grinding|Akathisia|Balance disturbance|Coordination problems|Torticollis|Cheek twitches|Other muscle contractions|Increased tics|Fractures|Tremor||Sleeping problems and fatigue||Insomnia|Hypersomnia|Increased fatigue|Vivid dreams and nightmares||Gastro-intestinal problems||Altered sensation of taste/smell|Weight gain or weight loss|Nausea and vomiting|Increased hungriness or decreased appetite|Esophagitis|Slow gastric emptying|Abdominal pain|Diarrhoea or constipation|Anal blood loss||Mouth, ENT and respiratory problems||Nose bleed|Dental infections|Dry mouth|Tinnitus|Hump of earwax|Respiratory infection|Shortness of breath|Sleep apnoea||Sexual and urinary problems||Urinary, prostate or kidney infection|Libido increase or decrease|Erection decrease|Ejaculation problem|Vaginal discharge|Urinary incontinence|Increased urinary frequency||Cardiovascular problems||Palpitations|Arterial hypertension|Episodic retrosternal pain||Neurologic problems||Headaches|A ""flashing"" sensation in the head|Pain away from incision/implant sites|Dizziness|Sedation|Paraesthesia|Changes in handwriting|Perseveration|Seizures|Coma|Paralysis||General problems||Transpiration|Warm and cold feeling|Nail biting|Body smell change|Hair pulling|Hair loss|Skin and skin attachment infection||Laboratory test abnormalities||Increased creatine kinase|Low ferritine|Increased amylase|Hypercholesterolemia|Diabetes mellitus||Psychiatric and cognitive problems||Irritability|Suicidality (thoughts/attempts)|Increased depression|Increased anxiety|Increased OCD|Aggression/violent behaviour|Angry|Overdrive|Memory complaints|Disinhibition|Recklessness|Hyperactivity|Logorrhoea|Accident proneness|Hypomania|Cognitive disturbance (clouding)|Panic attack|Tension/nervousness|Hysteria|Apathy|Loss of motivation|Lack of energy|Flashbacks|Confusion|Blackouts|Derealisation/depersonalisation|Excessive alcohol drinking|Medication abuse|Paranoia|Delusion|Family problems||Below is a list of possible adverse events with rechargeable but not with nonrechargeable neurostimulators for DBS in OCD:||A heating sensation over the neurostimulator during recharging|Local skin irritation over the neurostimulator during or after recharging|Hardware failure of the recharger including breakage of the recharger fixation belt.|Insufficient quality of the connection for energy transfer between the rechargeable neurostimulator and the recharger.|The battery of the rechargeable stimulator always needs to be recharged before it is totally empty. After more than one episode of a totally empty battery further proper functioning of the neurostimulator nor replacement within the proposed study design cannot be guaranteed by the constructor.||A committee consisting of the principle investigators will decide whether an adverse event is definitely, probably, possibly or not an adverse event due to the system for DBS for OCD. All expected and unexpected adverse events will be noted and published.||BIOSTATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS||Paired statistical tests for continuous data (A, f, PW, number of consultations,) and for ordinal data (Y-BOCS, GAF, HAM-A, HAM-D, BDI) pre- and post-implantation, as well as descriptive statistics for continuous data (number of recharging sessions, number of battery status controls, battery longevity, preferred stimulator type at replacement), will be used. No power calculation is performed.||ETHICS||Approval of the UZ/KU Leuven Ethics Committee, working after the ICH-GCP principles, will be asked for.

NCT04673578,"Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes oxidize arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, which modulate normal neuronal function and inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. COX-2, which is constitutively expressed by glutamatergic neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, plays an important physiological role in synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation. Pre-clinical studies point to a potential role for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit COX enzymes, in modulation of mood and anxiety symptoms. Recent meta-analyses also suggest a role for adjunctive COX inhibitors in the treatment of depression and first-episode schizophrenia. While consensus guidelines on the use of anti-inflammatory therapy in children with acute-onset subtypes of childhood-onset obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) suggest NSAIDs as a first-line option for patients with mild impairment, there is limited empirical evidence to support their use in this population. Two small randomized-controlled trials in adults with OCD demonstrated improved symptom severity with celecoxib - a selective COX-2 inhibitor - raising the possibility that COX inhibition may be effective in a general OCD population.||The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of celecoxib and placebo as adjuncts to treatment-as-usual on reduction in symptom severity, as determined by Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) after 12 weeks in children and youth with moderate-to-severe OCD.||This is a randomized, controlled, single-centre superiority trial with two parallel groups (celecoxib 100 mg [≤50 kg] or 200 mg [>50 kg] twice daily and placebo). Participants will be recruited from the BC Children's Hospital (BCCH) Provincial OCD Program and based on self-referral from community practices. Randomization will be performed as block randomization with a 1:1 allocation and stratified based on pre-treatment symptom severity. The investigator, outcomes assessor, clinician, and patient will be blinded to the intervention groups. Labs at baseline will include complete blood count (CBC) with differential, creatinine, liver enzymes, and CRP. Participants will be assessed for OCD severity and adverse events at weeks 6 and 12. Analysis will be carried out according to intention-to-treat principles. Power calculations using estimates based on previous studies suggest a target recruitment of 80 participants.||The primary outcome is OCD severity (as measured by total CY-BOCS score) after 12 weeks in the celecoxib compared to placebo arm, adjusted for baseline. Secondary outcomes include CY-BOCS score after 6 weeks adjusted for baseline OCD severity, difference in the proportion of participants achieving a clinically meaningful response or remission; mean clinical global impression of severity and improvement after 6 and 12 weeks; and difference between celecoxib and placebo arms in the proportion of participants reporting adverse events that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study intervention. Exploratory analyses will evaluate the associations among age, sex, BMI percentile, treatment at baseline, severity at baseline, CY-BOCS-II, symptoms of PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection) and PANS (pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome), time since diagnosis, and baseline CRP and the primary and secondary outcomes.||NSAIDs are common in clinical practice and referenced in both adult and pediatric treatment guidelines for OCD, but no controlled studies have evaluated the effects of COX inhibitors in childhood-onset OCD. This study will be the first to assess the efficacy and safety of adjunctive celecoxib in this population and will inform clinical management of children and youth with OCD.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT01687140,"Although research has demonstrated clear benefits of cognitive behavioral treatment for children with obsessive-compulsive disorder, typical rates of treatment response are far from absolute and even treatment responders tend to exhibit continuing symptoms. In one of the most cited and largest child OCD treatment study to date, only 39% of the participants showed a robust response to a 12-week course of CBT. In recent years, the basic research finding that D-Cyclocerine, a partial N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist, enhances extinction of learned fear among rats2 has generated significant interest among clinical researchers. This is not surprising given that the core component of CBT involves exposing the individual to the feared stimuli in the absence of the feared consequence (ie, extinction training). Indeed, data from several trials (for adults with social anxiety, specific phobia, and OCD) indicate that compared to placebo, when DCS is added to exposure, participants tend to respond faster and at higher rates to treatment. This significant development in clinical treatment for anxiety disorders has been examined in only one pilot study among children with OCD. In this study, the effects of DCS were modest but the methodology utilized (eg., no objective symptom measure, lack of information regarding aspects of treatment) make the results difficult to interpret. The present study will help clarify, albeit in only a preliminary way, whether DCS is a promising addition to the treatment options available to the OCD treatment provider. The greatest utility of the augmentation strategy may be the capability to hasten the rate of improvement, and thus, decrease the discomfort of treatment and decrease treatment drop-out.||*Research Design and Methods: Describe in detail the design and methodology of the study.||A) Overview We propose to examine the preliminary efficacy of D-cycloserine augmentation of eight sessions (two weeks) of intensive exposure and response prevention treatment administered to youngsters aged 7-17 with primary OCD. All subjects will be receiving clinical treatment through the UCLA Child OCD Intensive Outpatient Program and DCS will be introduced, and will be delivered during the third and fourth week (starting on the 9th IOP treatment visit) of the subject's participation in the IOP clinical treatment.||To best address these aims, a total twenty-six 7-17 year-old children and adolescents will be recruited from UCLA Child OCD Intensive Outpatient Program. After completing an eligibility screen, all qualified participants will undergo a baseline evaluation including diagnostic as well as symptom assessments before randomization or treatment. This baseline assessment will be completed no more than 5 days prior to their 9th treatment visit (i.e., their first day of DCS medication).||Following these assessments, subjects will be randomized to receive either DCS or placebo (PBO) 4 times weekly immediately preceding their treatment session for two weeks of treatment (4 sessions weekly). Study participants will receive the same cognitive-behavior treatment through IOP whether they are in the active (DCS) or placebo (PBO) condition. In addition, all subjects will continue clinical treatment in IOP for as long as clinically indicated. However, responders at study week 2 (CGI-I = 1 or 2) will be reassessed at three-month follow-up to establish durability of early response. Parents will participate in the child's clinical assessment, and fill out self-reports, to better help the research team understand the child's functioning. Please see attached table of procedures for overview.||B. Core Clinical Assessment (Visit 1):||Diagnostic assessment will be based on the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for DSM-IV, Child Version and Parent Version (ADIS-C & ADIS-P; Silverman & Albano, 1996). The ADIS is a structured interview schedule designed to obtain information about symptomatology, course, etiology, and severity of anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and externalizing disorders in children and adolescents. The following sections will be administered at this visit: all anxiety disorders (except selective mutism), anxiety disorder NOS, MDD, dysthmia, bipolar, ADHD, CD, ODD, substance use disorders, and tic disorders. The ADIS currently provides the basis for psychiatric diagnosis in our ongoing CAMELS Study for which the Child OCD, Anxiety, & TS program is a collaborating center. All potential research subjects will undergo ADIS assessment by one of the trained study clinical interviewers.

When possible, BATs will be realistic in that children will be asked to approach and/or touch actual feared object or situation. When that is not possible, children pictures or video will be used. BAT assessments will be designed idiographically for each participant based upon their responses to the clinician administered CYBOCS instrument. The task will be administered at baseline (study week 0), at end of study week 1, and end of treatment (end of study week 2). The BATs consisted of a series of gradually more difficult steps (ranging from 7 to 12 steps depending on the specific phobia). Due to the variability in number of steps on the BATs, percentage of steps completed will be used as the primary behavioral measure of BAT performance.||For the BAT, the child will be instructed to do their best, but also informed they can terminate the BAT at any time if they wish to do so. BATs are terminated at the child's request or when the terminal step is achieved. Children are asked to provide ratings of their anxiety utilizing SUDS ranging from 0 to 8 (0 = None, 2 = A Little, 4 = Some, 6 = A Lot, and 8 = Very Much). Ratings are obtained immediately following the last step of the BAT. (15-20 minutes at baseline, end of study week 1, end of study week 2, and 3-month follow-up).||Staff training and supervision on these and other project-specific clinical measures will be coordinated and supervised by senior research study personnel using standardized methods to maintain reliability over time. This portion of the assessment is estimated to take approximately 1.5 hours to 2 hours.||F. Procedure:||Following these assessments, a total of 26 eligible subjects from the UCLA IOP will be randomized by a computer-generated program in the UCLA research pharmacy in a double-blinded fashion to receive either eight-sessions of DCS augmented exposure plus response prevention (ERP +DCS) treatment (four times per week for 2 weeks) or eight sessions of placebo and ERP (ERP+PBO) for the same time period. All study staff and families have no knowledge of whether the individual youngsters are receiving placebo or DCS. All subjects will be clinically assessed after the first and second study weeks of treatment and again 12 weeks later. Additionally, there will be brief assessments (CY-BOCS and CGI measures) for the end of study weeks 4, 6, and 10. Parents will also participate in the child's clinical assessment, and fill out self-reports, to better help the research team understand the child's functioning.

NCT03313622,"This is a research study in which BCM is collaborating with Brown University/Butler Hospital and University of Pittsburgh. BCM and Butler Hospital will be enrolling sites. Brown University and University of Pittsburgh will be analyzing the assessment, EEG and facial recognition data.||Subjects will participate in a clinical interview (Day 1), and cognitive tasks with EEG (Day 2).||Neural data (through EEG) will be collected from OCD subjects when their symptoms are provoked, so we can look for biomarkers of that change. The subjects will be monitored through EEG and video recording for facial recognition. After initial video and EEG setup subjects will complete the Beads task followed by the Provocation task.||Day 1:||Demographics Questionnaire. Assesses psychiatric and medical treatment history.||SCID-5: Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM 5 (SCID): The SCID will be used to determine comorbid diagnoses at baseline.||Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS): The YBOCS is a 10-item inventory that assesses severity of OCD symptoms||Y-BOCS Symptom Checklist: The YBOCS symptom checklist assesses OCD symptom subtypes.||Trait Core Dimensions Questionnaire (TCDQ): The TCDQ measures prevalence of harm avoidant or incompleteness traits related to OCD.||Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The BAI is a 21-question self-report inventory that is used for measuring the severity of anxiety. The questions used in this measure ask about common symptoms of anxiety that the participant has had during the past week.||Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): The BDI is a 21-question self-report inventory designed to measure depression severity.||Beads Task:||Participants will be asked to make a series of categorical decisions that involve combining information about the value and probability of potential rewards. Subjects will sit in front of a computer monitor and place their hand over a box with orange and blue button that they will be asked to press based on their idea of which one will be the majority in a jar full of orange and blue beads. This task is designed to dissociate information value and quantity as the guesses are made based on information shown to the subject. Combining asymmetric rewards beads task with neuroimaging could dissociate neural signals related to information value from those related to information quantity. That is the goal here as we track neural activity through EEG measurements and facial recognition through video acquisition. This task should take 15-20 minutes to complete, not including EEG setup.||Provocation of OC symptoms (PROVOC):||PROVOC will be used to evoke manageable levels of OCD related distress. Three tasks will be developed collaboratively with the participant and independent evaluator that involve the participant being exposed in vivo to triggers that are considered by him/her impossible to confront without ritualizing. Each of the 3 tasks will be broken up into 7 steps, which provoke increasing levels of distress when encountered. Each step will be uniform in duration (i.e., one minute exposure) with the potential of 7 one-minute tasks with ~30 seconds break between steps, to provide brief rest for the patient and introduction of the next task. Participants will systematically confront triggers without ritualizing starting with easier items, and will continue until they feel their distress or need to ritualize is intolerable. This task will involve researchers and subjects deciding upon a few different triggering items (bloody (fake) napkin, used tissue, etc) that will be moved closer and closer to the subject as they wear the EEG measuring system. Each step should take one minute or less, and the subject will always have the option of stopping if the task becomes too distressing. There will also be a similar process involving objects that should not cause any distress to be used as a control. Consistent with prior research, 5 scores are calculated including percentage of steps completed, subjective units of distress (SUDS) across steps, avoidance, ritual engagement, and composite provocation score, which will be associated with changes in biosignature from brain recordings. We will pilot the provocation protocol, and start addressing problems that come up (e.g. EEG movement artifacts). Sessions will be videotaped with AFAR system concurrent to recording of LFPs from VS and scalp EEG.||High-density EEG System:||The g.BCIsys64USB EEG system, manufactured by g.tec GmBH, uses wide-range DC-coupled amplifier technology with 24-bit sampling, which results in an input voltage resolution of < 30 nV. Very efficient analog-to-digital converters (2.5 MHz per channel) result in very high signal to noise ratio, critical for recording subtle changes in EEG measures. The system combines four bio-amplifiers (16-channels each) that can either be stacked to provide a higher density (32/48/64 channels) system, or can simultaneously be used on different study participants. The EEG system makes use of 'active' electrode technology that employs an additional ultra-low noise pre-amplifier located inside each electrode to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. The active electrodes work in a frequency range from 0 - 10 kHz (DC) or 0.1 - 10 kHz (AC). The EEG system is also equipped with innovative data acquisition and data analysis software that allows sophisticated signal processing and data analysis capabilities. The system includes a 3D scalp digitizer that maps the scalp in the stereotactic space for EEG source localization. Other capabilities of the system include eye-tracking and acquisition of physiological data (SpO2, pulse and skin conductance).||Automated Facial Affect Recognition (AFAR) will be used to measure facial expression of positive and negative valence. AFAR is a computer-vision based approach that can objectively measure the occurrence, intensity, laterality, and timing of facial action units, head pose, and gaze at video frame rate (30 to 60 frames per second). Participants will be videotaped. Action units are anatomically based actions that individually or in combination can describe nearly all-possible facial expressions. AFAR has strong concurrent validity with manual measurement of facial action units, holistic expressions, depression severity, and psychological distress; and with ground truth measures of head pose and gaze. Previous research has identified action units associated with positive (e.g., enjoyment) and negative (e.g., fear, anger, disgust, and anxiety) emotion; and used them to represent scales for positive and negative valence and pain. Because gaze and head orientation also are strongly related to emotion and valence, we include them in positive and negative valence scales. Videotaped data will be shared with the University of Pittsburgh.||Local data and safety monitoring will be conducted by the PI who will meet regularly with the study team to review new information from clinical ratings, assessments, and medical records for each subject. Study-related adverse events or threats to subject confidentiality will be monitored, and any needed safety changes will be addressed. Assessment of adverse events, including grading of severity and attribution to research, will be conducted at each visit and noted on the rating coversheet. The PI will report all unanticipated problems within 5 working days from becoming aware of the event. The PI will evaluate all adverse events and determine whether the event affects the Risk/Benefit ratio of the study, and whether modifications to the protocol or consent form are required.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT03212703,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating psychiatric illness that frequently begins in childhood. It is characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions that are distressing, time consuming and significantly impairing. OCD is distinct in the extent to which it disrupts family functioning, in that there is intense parental pressure to become involved in rituals and to change home environments and schedules to avoid triggers, thus accommodating the OCD. It is also well known that OCD severity tends to worsen in the context of stressful environments and situations. While effective treatment approaches for pediatric OCD have been identified, partial response and treatment refusal are all too common, leading to chronicity of both the illness itself and of its deleterious familial effects.||The investigators plan to study a novel approach to help manage the stress of parenting a child with OCD, thus facilitating more effective resistance to OCD family accommodation and supporting the child in fighting this difficult illness. The investigators will explore the role of group-based mindfulness-based skills training (P-MBST) in supporting parents of OCD-affected youth, in particular investigating the possibility that increased distress tolerance as a result of mindfulness practice may help parents reduce OCD accommodation.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT04071990,"Participants will be recruited at the Centre for OCD at the Ghent University Hospital (UZ Gent) located in Belgium. A group of 80 patients and 80 live-in family members (partner, parent, sibling), between 18 and 65 years old. The patients with OCD will be selected based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder using the semi-structured Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI screening version 7.0.2)(60). Other inclusion criteria are (a) the OCD patient with a score of at least 16 on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), (b) patient and family member fluent in Dutch and (c) both willing to attend all treatment sessions together. To maximize the generalizability of our sample, we did not exclude patients if they had comorbid mood or anxiety disorders, as long as OCD was the principal diagnosis. Patients and family members will be recruited before randomization, because the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the involvement of the family in the CBGT. At the start of the experiment we will ask patients and their family members to sign the informed consent. Randomization occurs after oral and written informed consent and patients and family members will be notified about the treatment condition after randomization. After randomization the patient and family member will be allocated to one of the two treatment arms: (a) CBGT with involvement of family of family-based CBGT (FB-CBGT) (intervention) or (b) CBGT without involvement of family (control). The CBGT program exists of a fixed 12-week protocol, involving psycho-education, exposure and response prevention (ERP), cognitive restructuring, and the discussion about the family system.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT03572543,"Most effective behavioral treatments of disordered anxiety involve repeated exposure to feared stimuli, which often results in systematic reductions in fearful responding to said stimuli. It is believed that this process results from successful fear extinction, a well-characterized learning process that is mediated by fear extinction brain circuitry. Namely, fear extinction is an inhibitory learning process that requires activation and plasticity within a variety of brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which can exert inhibitory control over fearful responding and parts of the brain that drive said responding. Behavioral treatments of disordered anxiety, while effective, have serious limitations; many patients fail to respond at all or only partially respond to exposure-based treatments. One candidate reason for this is deficits in fear extinction learning or memory processes. The proposed study aims to examine the effects of non-invasive neuromodulation - namely, multifocal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the mPFC - on therapeutic learning and memory among adults diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).||This study will recruit 26 subjects with OCD to complete a two-day experimental protocol to examine the effects of tDCS on therapeutic learning and memory, which will be measured with an exposure and response prevention laboratory challenge. On Day 1, OCD subjects will be randomized (1:1, double-blind) to receive Active (n = 13) or Sham (n = 13) tDCS prior to completing five 10-minute in vivo exposure exercises to assess the effects of tDCS on the acquisition of therapeutic learning. Subjects and raters (including those directing exposure sessions) will be blind to allocation. On Day 2, OCD subjects will return to complete five additional exposure trials to examine the effects of tDCS on recall of therapeutic learning. Subjective ratings of emotional distress (0-100) will be collected at baseline, before and after tDCS, and during each minute of each exposure trial. It is hypothesized that tDCS will improve the acquisition and recall of therapeutic learning (Aim 4); that participants randomized to Active tDCS would show more rapid reductions in subjective distress and would recall therapeutic learning on Day 2 when compared to participants randomized that Sham tDCS.||tDCS will be delivered using an 8-channel Starstim transcranial electric stimulator from Neuroelectrics. To target the mPFC, the anodal electrode will be placed over the frontal pole (Fpz, 10-20 EEG landmarks) and will be surrounded by five return (cathodal) electrodes in a circumferential array (AF7, AF8, F3, Fz, and F4). Subjects in the Active tDCS condition will receive 20 minutes of direct current stimulation for 20 minutes; current will be ramped in and out for 30 seconds at the beginning and end of the 20-minute period. Subjects in the Sham tDCS condition will receive the same electrode placement and ramping procedures, but no current will be delivered between ramping.||Linear mixed modeling will be used to assess within and between-trial exposure-relevant learning. Power analyses suggest that a sample of 24 (12 per condition) would adequately power a priori analyses when using linear mixed modeling. Mixed ANOVA will be used to assess recall of exposure-relevant learning. The proposed study will provide important preliminary data to examine the potential for medial prefrontal tDCS to augment exposure-relevant therapeutic learning.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

Baseline and 8 months BPRS were simulated with a 7 point standard deviation (SD) normally distributed random variation both within and between patients (corresponding to a total SD=9.8 points for a single measurement), and a homogenous treatment effect, using R v. 3.3.1. 40 patients, 20 patients per group, would give 81% power to detect an 8 point adjusted mean difference in BPRS between the rituximab and placebo groups, and 89% power to detect a difference of 9 points. Reasonable power would be retained under 5% random drop-out, with 79% power to detect an 8 point difference and 87% power to detect a 9 point difference between the groups. The power to detect a 9 point difference would still be 85% with 10% random drop-out.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT00029068,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive means of stimulating the brain through the scalp and skull, has become an important tool in neurophysiology and neuropsychiatry. The purpose of this project is (1) to use TMS as a probe of cortical excitability to investigate the physiology of the cerebral cortex in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and OCD-related disorders (including the ""OCD spectrum""), which we believe to be disorders involving alterations in the excitability of the cortex; (2) to compare those findings to results in healthy individuals, and (3) to evaluate the possible effects of various pharmacological treatments on TMS parameters in individuals with OCD and OCD-related disorders. This protocol seeks to evaluate the hypothesis that TMS may provide a sensitive measure of cortical function that is relevant to the underlying pathology in OCD and OCD-related disorders. The identification of possible anomalies of TMS measures in these patient groups and changes elicited by pharmaceutical agents will be useful in orienting research towards investigations of the cortical neurotransmitter systems.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

ExAblate delivers a pulse of focused ultrasound energy, or sonication, to the targeted tissue. For OCD Patients: one or more thermal lesion will be created on one of the following targets: Anterior cingulate cortex, Anterior Limb of internal Capsule, Ventral Striatum or Subgenual Cingulate Cortex.||The treatment begins with a series of standard diagnostic MR images to identify the location and shape of tumor to be treated. The ExAblate computer uses the physician's designation of the target volume to plan the best way to cover the target volume with small spots called ""sonications"". These treatment spots are cylinder shaped. Their size depends on sonication power and duration. During the treatment, a specific MR scan, which can be processed to identify changes in tissue temperature, provides a thermal map of the treatment volume to confirm the therapeutic effect. The thermal map is used to monitor the treatment in progress, and confirm that the ablation is proceeding according to plan, thus closing the therapy loop.||The ExAblate transcranial operates a helmet-shaped transducer (currently utilizing 1000-element phased array transducer) positioned above the subject head. The ExAblate transcranial system also includes means to immobilize the subject head, cool the interface water, and software for CT analysis and phase correction computation.||After informed consent and screening, eligible subjects will proceed to the treatment. All subjects will be followed at Day 1, 7 days, 1 month, 6 months and 1, 2 and 3 years.

NCT03068429,"Fear conditioning paradigms are used to investigate the learning process of the fear response in patients with psychiatric disorders and healthy subjects. Patients with post traumatic stress disorder have been shown to fail to retrieve the memory of fear extinction during the recall phase of the fear conditioning paradigm when compared to healthy subjects. In one previous trial, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients have demonstrated the same failure to recall extinction and the results from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation maps have shown different regions being recruited during recall when compared with healthy subjects. However, in that previous trial, some of the OCD patients included were already taking medication for OCD. In the current trial, we will evaluate 24 unmedicated OCD patients with a two-day fear conditioning paradigm before and after 4-weeks of treatment initiation with sertraline up to 200mg/day or maximum tolerated dosage. Sertraline is a first-line treatment option for OCD. At baseline, OCD patients will be compared to 24 healthy subjects. At post treatment, fear conditioning and fMRI results wil be compared to baseline. OCD patients are expected to demonstrate worsened extinction retention compared to healthy subjects at baseline. Sertraline treatment is expected to improve extinction retention compared to baseline and to normalize the brain regions being recruited with the conditioned stimuli presented during the recall phase. By ""normalize"" we mean that after treatment the regions being recruited will be the same as the ones recruited by healthy subjects during baseline, in other words, differences found at baseline regarding brain activation by the conditioned stimuli are expected to disappear after treatment.||Abbreviations: CS= conditioned stimuli, CS+= conditioned stimuli to shock, CS-=neutral conditioned stimuli, CS+E= extinguished conditioned stimuli to shock, CS+U=unextinguished conditioned stimuli to shock",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT03002753,"The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the overall efficacy and differential effects of two interventions for patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) according to DSM-5. The interventions to be compared are detached mindfulness (DM) and cognitive restructuring (CR). Whereas the efficacy of CR for the treatment of OCD has been proven in various studies, the efficacy of DM as a single intervention so far has only been shown within a case study and within a non-clinical sample. By contrast, the efficacy of complex metacognitive protocols (of which DM constitutes one of several single interventions) has been shown multiple times. So far, however, little is known about the efficacy of DM as a single intervention in a clinical sample and the differential working mechanisms of DM vs. CR.||Whereas DM is supposed to modify metacognitions by teaching patients to solely observe their intrusive thoughts, CR aims at teaching the patients to actively question and modify their distorted interpretations of their intrusions. Since previous research has shown that symptom reduction is mediated by a change in metacognition but not by a change of distorted interpretations, the investigators hypothesize that, while expecting both interventions to be similarly effective on an overall scale, DM will lead to a change in both metacognitions and distorted interpretations whereas CR will predominantly have an effect on distorted interpretations while influencing metacognitions to a lesser extent. Further research questions address differences concerning the applicability of the two interventions in patients' everyday life and the degree to which an intense psychoeducation can already have an effect on the participants' overall symptom burden.||The intervention (both DM and CR) is spread over four sessions of 100 min each taking place within two weeks (i.e. two sessions per week) and includes intensive homework assignments for the patients. The intervention will be delivered by MSc-level clinical psychologists completing the clinical training for becoming a licenced psychotherapist in Germany (""Psychologischer Psychotherapeut""). The diagnostic assessment involves clinical interviews and a number of questionnaires and will be conducted by independent assessors who have a qualification similar to the study therapists. Assessment involves pre-, post- and follow-up assessment. Additionally, assessment comprises data collection via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in order to measure OCD symptoms (intrusions, emotions and coping strategies), the degree to which participants apply the newly learned strategy (DM or CR) in everyday life and the amount of relief experienced from applying it. There will be one EMA before (Pre-EMA) and one after the intervention (Post-EMA). For EMA, participants receive a smartphone for four days each (Friday to Monday) and are randomly prompted ten times per day to fill in a short questionnaire. The average amount of time necessary to fill in the questionnaire is assumed to be less than 2 min, based on a sample trial with mentally healthy participants.||Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) DM, 2) CR, and 3) a waitlist control group. The waitlist control group will wait for two weeks (i.e., as long as the intervention in the other two groups last), before participants will be once more randomly assigned to one of the two active conditions (DM and CR), which they will then regularly participate in. Thus, all participants enrolled in the study receive one of the two treatments sooner or later. For participants who are initially assigned to the waitlist group, there will be a second pre-assessment prior to the start of the intervention.||The study is going to be sponsored by the Christoph-Dornier-Stiftung für Klinische Psychologie, which is a non-profit organization that supports research in clinical psychology and awards PhD scholarships to clinical psychologists.

NCT03929081,"Sample size calculation: for the primary study objective, the 95-95 approach to determine the non-inferiority margin was used. Results of a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of CBT for OCD indicated that the mean (95 percent Confidence Interval (1.04) generates a non-inferiority margin of .42. Expressed in scores on the primary outcome measure Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), this would be a loss of about 2 points on this scale with a range of 0-40, which is clinically almost negligible. Applying an alpha of 0.05, a beta of 80%, and a .42 non-inferiority margin, a sample size of 71 per arm is adequate. Since analyses have to be run on the per protocol (P)- and the intention-to-treat (ITT) sample, 203 participants have to be recruited (anticipating 30 percent drop-out). Moreover, this sample size allows testing the secondary hypothesis: IBA is more effective than CBT for patients with OCD with poor insight (approximately 25 percent of the population). Applying a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 80 percent and effect size of Cohen's d =1, a sample of 34 participants is needed (in a previous study a between groups effect of 1.7 was found), anticipating 30 percent drop-out, 48 participants with poor insight at baseline are needed.||Previous studies into the influence of psychotherapy for OCD on brain structure and functioning have used sample sizes of 9-45. Based on their findings, analysing data for a minimum of 30 participants per condition is planned to explore the working mechanisms of the treatment modalities. Anticipating an upper limit of 30 percent drop-out rate, 2 x 43 respondents will be included, as well as 43 control subjects.||Adherence to treatment protocol: the therapists will be extensively trained in adherence to the protocol and the use of the premade forms for exercises and homework assignments. All treatment sessions will be audiotaped. Each therapist will receive supervision. During supervision, the supervisor will listen to parts of the audiotapes to give feedback and to make sure that the therapist does not drift from the protocol.||Furthermore, after the study is completed, there will be an adherence check. A trained blinded assessor will sample-wise listen to audiotapes of the session to score whether it was an IBA of CBT session.||Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: patients will be assessed during five time points, including two follow ups. Further, patients will fill in two questionnaires after each treatment session. Participants of the additional imaging part will be subjected to two extra sessions for MRI scanning and cognitive testing. Healthy controls will be measured once.||Safety Committee: the current study has been classified as low risk. No risk is expected of administering IBA, compared to receiving standard clinical care (CBT). IBA treatment will be conducted by well-trained clinicians. Some psychological discomfort may occur with respect to discussing emotional symptoms, these will be constraint to the minimum. No extra discomfort regarding to standard clinical care is expected. MRI scanning, after extensive screening for eligibility, is classified as a non-significant to low risk.||Statistical analyses: statistical analyses will be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) as well as the per-protocol sample (PP). Missing data will be replaced using the multiple imputation method. For all analyses, corrected p-values of <0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant. Safety data (e.g. side effects) will be collected and summarized in the study results. A description of the analyses for the primary and secondary objectives is provided below.||Primary study parameter(s): the YBOCS, a validated questionnaire with 10 items and a maximum score of 40, will be used as the primary outcome parameter. To conclude non-inferiority, the upper margin of the 95 percent confidence interval, i.e. the maximum difference between groups within this 95 percent confidence interval, should not exceed the non-inferiority margin of 2 points on the YBOCS. To determine non-inferiority immediately following treatment and at follow-up, one-sided tests will be conducted at post-treatment, at six month follow-up and one year follow-up assessment. Linear mixed-effects models will be used, regressing the continuous outcome measures on intervention by time interaction terms, both in the ITT- and the PP-sample.||Secondary study parameter(s): mixed-effects models will be used to test the treatment effects between the two treatment conditions for the secondary outcome measures level of insight, using the Overvalued Ideas Scale (OVIS); severity of depressive symptoms, using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); severity of anxiety symptoms, using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI); social functioning, using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS); quality of life (using the Euroquol); relationship satisfaction, using the Relationship Satisfaction Scale (RSS) and tolerability of treatment, using the Treatment Acceptability/Adherence Scale (TAAS). Exploratively a multiple regression analysis will be used to determine which factors predict treatment outcome.||A linear mixed model will be used to determine whether insight improves more or earlier in patients who underwent IBA compared to those who underwent CBT. A time-lag model (a linear mixed model) will be used to determine whether change in insight is related to symptom reduction.||Neuroimage (pre)processing: fMRI data will be analysed using Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software or FMRIB Software Library (FSL). Standard group comparisons will be conducted to analyse structural and task-related (symptom provocation) (f)MRI. Full factorial analyses with the factors group (IBA vs CBT) and time (pre- vs posttreatment) will be conducted to determine the effect of treatment on task-related brain activity. Independent component analysis (ICA; FSL MELODIC) and dual regression analyses will be conducted to investigate changes in functional connectivity within networks (e.g. Salience Network, Default Mode Network, CEN). Brain regions with fluctuations concurrent over time in blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD; proxy for brain activity) will automatically per person be assigned to a component. After filtering and a clean-up of the components (components that seem to result from movement or scanner artefacts), the mean components per group will be determined. By means of non-parametric permutation tests (FSL randomise), functional connectivity of the networks will be compared between the intervention groups and over time. To conduct whole-brain network analyses, the structural MRI will be parcellated into 225 separate regions of interest (ROIs) based on the Brainnetome atlas. These parcellations will be transformed to the resting-state fMRI and the time series will be extracted per ROI and correlated to each other to arrive at a whole-brain network connectivity matrix per subject. Using a similar network approach, the DTI images will allow for tractography in order to measure structural connectivity. The Brain connectivity toolbox (BCT) will be used to calculate topological indices of the networks (e.g. modularity, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient and efficiency) from these network connectivity matrices. Network topological indices reduce the abundant amount of information resulting from the brain scan to only a few neurobiologically meaningful measures. Global efficiency, for instance, provides a measure of how efficiently information can travel through a network and betweenness centrality of the relative importance of a brain region for the information flow within a network. These topological network measures will be calculated per assessment and condition and subsequently compared by means of permutation tests.||Statistical Neuroimage analysing: to investigate whether treatment modality (IBA/CBT) predicts changes in resting state and task-based functional networks, a multivariate regression analysis will be conducted with treatment modality as independent variable and pre-to posttreatment changes in functional networks as dependent variables. To investigate the association with changes in YBOCS scores and neurocognitive performance, these variables will be entered in the first block. Possible confounders (e.g. medication use, age, disease duration) will be controlled for.||Machine learning techniques will be conducted to investigate whether multimodal pre-treatment brain characteristics (using T-1, DTI and rs- and task-based fMRI) have predictive value for treatment response in the CBT and IBA group separately. The neuroimaging characteristics will be entered into a supervised multivariate classification procedure using a linear support vector machine (SVM) algorithm.||The procedure consists of a training, validation and testing phase. During the training phase, a hyperplane will be estimated that maximally separates the remitters from the non-remitters based on all available data points (features) that show a difference between the groups. The SVM validation phase will consist of a leave-one-per-group-out cross-validation. Then the accuracy will be tested with which the determined hyperplane could classify other patients during the classification stage with independent data (20%) not used for training. This procedure will be iterated 10.000 times for each network. This results in an accuracy measure, per subject, based on the number of times the subject was included in the test sample and correctly classified. The accuracy will be tested on significance. If predictors of response to IBA differ from those to CBT, a post hoc analysis will be carried out with predictors for both IBA and CBT response within the entire OCD group.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT03356483,"Aim 1: To investigate the effects of psilocybin on OCD symptomatology. OCD symptom severity will be assessed before treatment and 24 and 48 hours after treatment, one week after treatment, two weeks, one month, three months, and six months after treatment. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that 0.25mg/kg of psilocybin will lead to greater symptom improvement than niacin (as the active-placebo-control agent) at all assessment points.||Aim 2: To explore the relationship between the psilocybin-induced brain connectivity changes and neuronal activation following symptom provocation in OCD. Resting-state brain connectivity will be assessed before and 48 hours after treatment. Neuronal activation induced by OCD-relevant provocative stimuli will be assessed 48 hours after the treatment. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that (i) psilocybin will normalize abnormal fronto-striatal functional connectivity in patients with OCD; (ii) psilocybin will decrease activation of anterior cingulate cortices, amygdala, and putamen in response to symptom-provoking stimuli, and normalization of one or more of these abnormalities will correlate with improvement in symptomatology after psilocybin treatment.||This study will pilot a single-center, randomized, active-placebo-controlled, double-blind design to examine the clinical and neural effects on OCD, of either 0.25mg/kg of psilocybin or active placebo-control agent (niacin 250mg), given along with non-drug preparatory and follow-up support appointments to 30 study participants.The duration of the randomized study phase is from consent until two weeks after drug administration.

NCT00395213,"The Antidepressant Safety in Kids (ASK) study is part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Trials Network (CAPTN).||Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medications are prescribed to approximately 2 to 3% of American children. Evidence suggests that these medications are beneficial for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, and major depressive disorder. Following hearings in February and September of 2004, the FDA mandated Black Box warnings for all antidepressants, cautioning prescribers about the risk of treatment-emergent suicidal tendency in children and adolescents treated with these drugs. Although prescribing waned somewhat following the warning, many children continue to receive SSRIs and SNRIs for a variety of conditions that do not have empirically validated alternative treatments. Therefore, there is a pressing need to clearly understand the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of SSRIs and SNRIs in children and adolescents.||Specific Aim:||The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of SSRI and SNRI medications for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, eating disorders, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The study will characterize predictors of outcome, including demographic, disease severity, comorbidity, concomitant treatment, and genetic variation. This information will help clinicians to better understand the balance of risk and benefit associated with antidepressants and to answer the question of which treatment is best for which child.||Three specific aims include the following:||To evaluate the within-subject benefit of antidepressant treatment over acute (12 weeks) and maintenance (an additional 6 months) of treatment;|To evaluate the adverse event profile for harm to self, harm to others, and psychiatric and nonpsychiatric adverse events;|To evaluate potential moderators and mediators of benefits and adverse events.||Design:||This will be a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 2,420 consecutively enrolled patients who are prescribed an SSRI or SNRI (Citalopram [Celexa], Escitalopram [Lexapro], Fluoxetine [Prozac/Prozac Weekly], Fluvoxamine [Luvox], Paroxetine, [Paxil/Paxil-Cr], Sertraline [Zoloft], Venlafaxine [Effexor/Effexor XR], Duloxetine [Cymbalta]).

NCT03274440,"Prior research suggests that certain areas of the brain are receptive to chemicals like those found in the cannabis (marijuana) plant, known as cannabinoids, and that these regions may be involved in anxiety disorders and OCD.

NCT03754647,"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is the fourth-most common mental disorder. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated OCD to be among the top 10 causes of years lived with illness related disability by 2020. Various psychological, social, genetic and biochemical factors are presumed to be involved in the etiology of OCD. Researches so far have indicated that free radical induced injuries are involved in the pathology of OCD. A well-known source of antioxidant is Vitamin C, which is easily available, cheap and more powerful regarding antioxidant effects compared to many other natural sources of vitamin C. Until now little study has been performed to observe the effect of vitamin C administration concurrent to the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of OCD. Therefore the present study has been designed to assess the effects of vitamin C along with SSRIs upon OCD patients. The study would be a prospective type of interventional study to be conducted in the Department of Pharmacology and Department of Psychiatry, BSMMU, from September 2017 to February 2019. A total of 90 OCD patients will be selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients will be divided randomly into 2 groups: group A and group B. Group A would consist of 45 patients who will receive only SSRIs orally daily and group B would consist of 45 patients who will receive vitamin C, 500 mg BID orally daily along with SSRIs for 8 weeks. Comparison between the two groups will be performed through biochemical parameters of oxidative stress markers such as serum malondialdehyde (MDA), serum reduced glutathione (GSH) and serum vitamin C levels at baseline (before vitamin C administration) and 8 weeks after intervention by vitamin C. Along with the biochemical parameters, Yale-Brown score of obsessive-compulsive disorders (Y-OCD) would also be assessed by Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS).Data would be analyzed by Scientific Package for Social Science(SPSS) and represented by tables and figures as applicable. Significance level would be set at 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001. Patient's data will be recorded in a predetermined data sheet. Patients will be informed about the study in easy language and then informed consent will be taken. This study has no potential risk to the patients.

NCT00082550,"Evidence suggests that the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) arise from dysfunction of both the serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. These two neurotransmitter systems are presumed to play a key modulatory role at the limbic-motor interface of the fronto-subcortical circuitry. However, in vivo knowledge linking the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems to OCD and OCD-related disorders is limited. In the current protocol, we plan to use PET to image the serotonin transporter (SERT) within the new radioligand [11C]DASB, in order to delineate regional abnormalities in SERT binding in drug-naive or drug-free OCD patients in comparison to healthy volunteers. In addition, we plan to examine the relationship between the regional PET measures of SERT and clinical severity measures of OCD.

Constant current amplitude will be used and increased in a step-wise fashion as tolerated and without exceeding current density upper limits. The constant current setting is particularly useful in the early weeks to months following surgery when impedances are still changing. In order to elicit a mirth response, amplitude needs to return to 0 microamps for about 30 seconds before testing the next increment. For example, if 2mA, C+1, 90usec, 130Hz is ineffective, then amplitude is reduced to 0mA for 30 seconds and then rapidly increased to 4mA, C+1-, 90usec, 130Hz. Soft start needs to be turned off. Bipolar settings will also be tested and need to be used during rsfMRI. DBS parameters will be optimized/adjusted based on clinical evaluation of mood and anxiety and to minimize side effects. The following observed effects will be recorded via a scale used in a past study: facial expression, nervousness, alertness, and positive or negative affect. Facial expression will be measured using the AFAR system. AFAR will measure the maximum intensity and velocity of the smile response in action units. Participants¿ faces will be recorded on video as their stimulation is increased to elicit the mirth response. Changes in facial expression using facial muscles of orbicularis oris (muscle that encircles the mouth) zygomaticus (major and minor muscles of the angle of the mouth) will be recorded.

Programming of the DBS device will occur at Visit 6, 1 week later.||The subject will return to clinic every 2 weeks for the first 2 months following the system activation. Each visit will last about 3-4 hours and will include clinician administered assessments, self-rated assessments, recordings and tasks to be performed.||Post-surgical 1.5 rs-fMRI scans will also be performed according to Medtronic standard post-implant MRI guidelines for deep brain stimulation systems to ensure safety.||Participants will be asked to keep their current medications constant for the first 6 months post-surgery. However, clinical circumstances which mandate changes will be allowed and notated should this occur.||Provocation Tasks:||The Provocation OC task (Provoc) and the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) will be used to start OC-related distress and distress unrelated to OCD (e.g., performance anxiety), respectively. Three sessions will be videotaped with Automated Facial Affect Recognition (AFAR) system concurrent to recording of local field potentials (LFPs) from VS and scalp electroencephalography (EEG).||CBT Augmentation:||Starting at Month 7, subjects will receive a two-month (15 session) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) course where exposure and response prevention (ERP) for OCD will be delivered. Subjects already receiving stable CBT will be allowed to continue it during the study. Instead, we have developed standardized instructions to encourage exposure and resist compulsions (ERP) during this portion of the trial. Participants will be encouraged at study visits to actively confront OC triggers while refraining from ritual engagement. Subjects, especially those who are still habitually avoiding, will be given the opportunity to derive maximal clinical benefit by receiving a two-month ""refresher"" course of CBT prior to entering the double-blind discontinuation phase at 9 months.||Double Blinded Discontinuation:||The purpose of the one-month blinded discontinuation period is to confirm clinical benefit. At the end of month 8, subjects will enter a one-month delayed onset withdrawal period in which the subject and Independent Evaluators are blinded to timing of discontinuation. The decision whether to reinstate active DBS at the end of the discontinuation will be based on clinical considerations in discussion with the subject and significant others. The benefits and discomforts will be carefully weighed in arriving at a long-term plan. Escape criteria will include withdrawing consent or significant clinical deterioration warranting unblinding or reinstatement of treatment. Following exit from the discontinuation period, treatment will recommence as clinically indicated, including stimulation resumption or continued observation with the device off.||Monthly Programming/Classification/Evaluation Visits until End of Study (EOS):||Months 10-18 (Visits 20-28) - Following exit from the discontinuation phase based on clinical indication, treatment will recommence as clinically indicated around Month 10, including stimulation resumption or continued observation with device off. Refining state classifications and testing machine learning will continue, if stimulation is reinstated. Subjects that participated in the discontinuation phase will be considered off-treatment once Month 18 visit (Visit 298) has occurred.These visits will take place monthly for 9 months. Each visit will last approximately 3-4 hours.||Long-Term Follow-Up:||After the 18 months of the study, the device will remain implanted in those subjects who are doing well clinically. For subjects who are not responsive, it will be explanted, if the surgical risks of explantation are deemed acceptable by the treatment team. The follow-up management will be arranged on a case-by-case basis, depending on geographic location and desires of the subject, and DBS therapy management by our team will be guaranteed for at least two years if subjects continue to receive DBS therapy and do not arrange alternative management during that period. Attempts will be made to collect all device-related adverse events in all willing participants at 6-month intervals after they exit the currently proposed study.||Subject participation is anticipated to continue for a minimum of 18 months.||For RC+S:||ENROLLMENT: A subject is considered enrolled upon signing informed consent, deemed eligible to be screened by the investigator. The informed consent process may include discussions with the patient¿s family and referring clinician. Medical records that can be obtained will be carefully reviewed to determine adequacy of past treatments including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).||A subject identification number will be assigned to each subject that signs consent. This number will be used to identify the subject and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject throughout the study.||SCREENING: Potential subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and willing to participate in the study as demonstrated by signing the informed consent will be enrolled in the study and undergo 2 screening visits (Visit 1 and Visit 2) spaced over an approximate 1 month period. Diagnostic and screening ratings are completed, followed by complete medical, neurological and neurosurgical evaluations. Final selection of candidates will be made by consensus of the multi-disciplinary investigator team (Project Advisory Committee).||Neuroimaging Methods:||DBS implanted subjects will undergo 2- 3T MRI Scans prior to surgery (1 research MRI at CAMRI and 1 clinical MRI at BSLMC). DBS implanted subjects will under 3 MEGs total.||Control subjects will undergo 1- 3T MRI scan (research MRI scan at CAMRI). Control subjects will also undergo 3 MEG scans.||The Center for Advanced MR Imaging (CAMRI) at the Main Campus location of Baylor College of will perform the research 3T MRI scans, which will only be collected on all subjects (DBS and control) using the Prisma scanner on this project for consistency.||TREATMENT: Subjects eligible for DBS implantation will also have an additional clinical, pre-surgical 3T MRI scan performed at baseline. This scan will be performed on a Philips scanner at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center (BSLMC). This scan is necessary in order to potentially screen out individuals presenting with brain abnormalities which would not be compatible with the surgery (e.g., congenital defects, lack of normal anatomic correlates) and to assist with surgical planning.||All Subjects (DBS and control) will also undergo MEG scans. This is also needed as a baseline assessment as MEG scans will also be performed post implantation at 2 weeks and 6 months. These scans will be performed on a MEG scanner at the Texas Children¿s Hospital in the Houston Medical Center.||Chest X-ray and EKG will also be performed.||Age/gender matched non-implanted subjects will serve as controls. They will undergo 1-research 3T MRI and 3 MEG scans using the same imaging protocol and at the same time points as OCD implant subjects to control for non-DBS effects on rs-fc.||TREATMENT:||Unless collected prior to the day of surgery, A a head CT will be performed on the morning of surgery for stereotactic planning.||Employing local anesthetic (with or without sedation as clinically indicated), a stereotactic headframe (Leksell Model G, Elekta Instruments, Atlanta, GA, USA) will be attached to the subject¿s skull on the morning of surgery in the operating room.||A 3D volumetric image (O-Arm 2, Medtronic Inc, Boulder, CO, USA) will be performed for purposes of defining the volumetric stereotactic headspace.||The images will be uploaded onto a Computer Workstation (Stealth S7, Medtronic, Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) equipped with stereotactic planning software (Cranial 3.0) for the purpose of planning the surgery. The preoperative 3T MRI obtained prior to the surgical date, will be fused with the CT scan in the surgical planning station. The initial target point within the ventral striatum will be chosen based on the subject¿s specific anatomy. The surgical trajectory to this point will also be planned in order to avoid prominent vessels, the sulci, and the ventricles. The computer will generate the X, Y and Z coordinates to set on the frame as well as the coronal and sagittal angles of approach required to establish the desired trajectory and target point. This initial target point will be modified by the subject¿s specific anatomy as determined by the preoperative 3T scan. The final target coordinates will be determined during this analysis.||While the surgeon is planning the procedure, the subject will be positioned supine on the operating table. A Foley catheter will be inserted. Antibiotics will be administered intravenously and vital signs will be monitored. The stereotactic head frame will be fixed to the operating table for subject safety, with the head elevated for subject comfort. A sterile prep and drape will be performed.||The target coordinates will be set on the stereotactic frame bringing the target point to the center of the operating arc. Additional local anesthetic will be given at the point of incision. Following incision, a 14 mm burr hole will be made employing a self-stopping perforator. The burr hole cap provided with the DBS lead will be secured to the skull with two screws. The dura will be coagulated and incised. The pial surface will be gently coagulated and a small incision will be made to allow easy entry of the electrode guides, which will be inserted to the brain according to standard stereotactic protocol.||A microelectrode (MER) probe will be inserted through the cannula and advanced in sub mm steps until the target is reached. Intraoperative image guidance will be obtained to ensure the MER probe is not mechanically deviated from target. If a deviation is identified, the stereotactic headframe will be adjusted accordingly.||Once the above adjustments have been made, the DBS quadripolar electrode (model 3387; Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) will be inserted through the guide tube to the target point. Reticles will be attached to the frame and intraoperative imaging will be employed to confirm that the lead tip is positioned at the target and assess for the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage. Sedation will be withdrawn. An extension cable will be connected to the lead sterilely and the other end will be passed off the field to be connected to an external pulse generator so that test stimulation may be performed. Test stimulation will be performed via each contact to 1) assess for stimulation-induced side effects and 2) monitor for acute changes in behavior using a Likert-type scale to assess anxiety, arousal, and mood. Intra operative behavioral testing of stimulation will be videotaped Intra-operative X-ray imaging may be performed as needed (up to 4 times per side) to ensure proper target has been reached.||A post-implantation 3D volumetric scan will be performed to confirm the electrode position.||Steps 5-9 above will be performed to insert the second electrode on the other side of the brain to complete implantation of both electrodes.||If there are no untenable side effects, the leads will be secured to the skull with the burr hole caps. The free end of the leads will be left in the sub-galeal space and the incisions will be closed in anatomical layers.||The headframe will be removed and general anesthesia will be induced. The Olympus RC+S pulse generator will then be implanted and connected to the brain lead via extension cables.||A post-operative CT scan will be performed prior to discharge to ensure that an intracerebral hemorrhage has not occurred.||The subject will be taken to the Recovery Room or the Neurosurgery ICU for post-operative monitoring (See below) and will be discharged from the hospital after at least one night of observation and when clinically stable. A Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) may be run on the subject to confirm they are clinically stable.||The subject will return to the neurosurgery clinic (Visit 4) for post-operative evaluation according to normal clinical practice (approximately 1 week after surgery). The wounds will be inspected and the subjects neurological status will be assessed. Sutures will be removed.||Subjects will be asked to keep their current medications constant for the first 6 months post-surgery, but clinical circumstances which mandate changes will be allowed and notated should this occur.||DBS Programming:||Initially, a monopolar survey will be conducted with frequency set to 130 Hz and pulse width to 90 microseconds. Constant current amplitude will be used and increased in a step-wise fashion as tolerated and without exceeding current density upper limits. The constant current setting is particularly useful in the early weeks to months following surgery when impedances are still changing. In order to elicit a mirth response, amplitude needs to return to 0 microamps for about 30 seconds before testing the next increment. For example, if 2mA, C+1, 90usec, 130Hz is ineffective, then amplitude is reduced to 0mA for 30 seconds and then rapidly increased to 4mA, C+1-, 90usec, 130Hz. Soft start needs to be turned off. Bipolar settings will also be tested and need to be used during rsfMRI. DBS parameters will be optimized/adjusted based on clinical evaluation of mood and anxiety and to minimize side effects. The following observed effects will be recorded via a scale used in a past study: facial expression, nervousness, alertness, and positive or negative affect. Facial expression will be measured using the AFAR system. AFAR will measure the maximum intensity and velocity of the smile response in action units. Participants¿ faces will be recorded on video as their stimulation is increased to elicit the mirth response. Changes in facial expression using facial muscles of orbicularis oris (muscle that encircles the mouth) zygomaticus (major and minor muscles of the angle of the mouth) will be recorded. This information will be used to train a classifier to recognize that stimulation intensity is too great. We will also have the subject self-report on changes in mood, anxiety, energy and side effects.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT03918837,"Obsessive Compulsive Disorders (OCD) are a frequent and debilitating disease. Impact on daily life is usually important, with a high rate of mood and anxious comorbidities, such as Major Depressive Disorder occurring in half of these participants. The effects can be dramatic, leading to higher suicide rate in this population.||Guidelines for OCD treatment in France recommend the use of Serotonin Specific Recapture Inhibitors (SSRI) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), if possible simultaneously. However, those treatments are responsible for adverse effects for the first and not easily accessible for the second. Consequently, a non-negligible number of participants still suffers from symptoms of OCD with a non-optimal treatment.||Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive neurostimulation method, has shown its usefulness in the treatment of mental illnesses. It has been authorized by the Food and Drugs Administration in the United States for the treatment of OCD. It represents an alternative method for helping those participants, but pattern of modifications over OCD pathophysiology has still to be unraveled.||In order to precisely analyze the effects of Low Frequency rTMS (LF rTMS) on OCD, the investigators designed a monocentric, prospective, double blind study comparing cerebral blood flow (CBF) before and after a rTMS treatment. Measurements will be performed on the Orbito Frontal Cortex (OFC), whose role in OCD has already been shown by our team (Nauczyciel et al, 2014 in Translational Psychiatry), using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL).||Inclusion criteria will be OCD diagnosis, age between 18 and 65, and the lack of counter indication to MRI and rTMS. Participants will firstly undergo MRI before treatment, along with a psychometric assessment. Participants will then receive a one-week rTMS treatment, with two sessions of fifteen minutes per day. Second MRI and evaluation will be performed 4 weeks after the end of the treatment.||Psychometric assessment will consist of MINI, YBOCS, CGI, MADRS, HAMA, and GAF, administered before and four weeks after treatment. The psychiatrist giving the assessment will be blind to the randomization of the patient, so will be the radiologist performing the MRI.||Our primary outcome is to show a significant difference between CBF in OCD in participants treated by rTMS versus participants treated by sham rTMS.

A closer examination of biological mechanisms underlying psychopathology may help uncover mechanisms to target during intervention and thereby provide a novel approach to treatment. Given that the neuropeptide, oxytocin, is involved in the regulation of a variety of social and cognitive dimensions, including emotion recognition and social attentional processing, there are direct implications regarding its role in the development of such deficits among individuals with BDD. The current study therefore aims to investigate the effect of oxytocin administration on social cognitive impairments in BDD and a related disorder, OCD. Twenty treatment-seeking male and female outpatients with BDD, 20 individuals with OCD, and 20 healthy participants will be assigned to receive an oxytocin and placebo nasal spray one week apart.

NCT04286126,"Medications (SSRIs and D2 antagonists) and cognitive-behavioral therapy are the mainstays of treating OCD; however, many patients show only a partial response, and more than 25% of patients show no improvement with these treatments. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising alternative, using powerful, focused magnetic field pulses to stimulate target brain areas. So far, at least two stimulation targets have consistent evidence of efficacy in OCD: the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Patients often show a strong response to one target but not the other. It is not well understood why some patients respond, while others do not.||The investigators previously developed methods for discovering neurophysiological subtypes of depression based on resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) measures of functional connectivity (RSFC) in relevant brain networks; diagnosing them in individual patients; and using them to predict individual differences in rTMS response. Subsequently, motivated by recent studies characterizing individual variability in the topology of these functional networks, the investigators have optimized methods for improving the accuracy of these predictions by accounting for individual variability, stabilizing the selection of treatment-predictive features, and increasing robustness in replication samples through regularization. Here, the investigators propose applying these methods to discover novel network-based subtypes of OCD and develop prognostic neuroimaging biomarkers for predicting differential treatment response to rTMS targeting the DMPFC or OFC, which could subsequently be tested in a randomized clinical trial.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

The computerized training will provide statements intended to activate the mechanisms involved in thought-action-fusion (TAF), which will almost always produce a negative outcome interpretation. It is hypothesized that through TAF-INC participants will learn alternative, more neutral, ways of interpreting the thoughts and lower the subject's TAF. The TAF-CON condition will receive the same statements as TAF-INC, but TAF-CON is designed to leave the interpretation of the scenarios unchallenged. The study will also include another comparison condition, SMP, to test if TAF-INC outperforms not only TAF-CON, but also stress reduction techniques provided in empirically supported psychological treatment.

NCT03852186,"Introduction Anxiety disorders are some of the most prevalent mental illnesses affecting 350.000-400.000 Danes every year. Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the most disabling anxiety disorders and is characterised by the presence of intrusive thoughts, urges, or images that cause anxiety, and, in turn, by repetitive behaviours that are often performed in an attempt to reduce the anxiety. OCD has a lifetime prevalence of 2-3 %. If left untreated, OCD is a chronic anxiety disorder resulting in deteriorating mental health with high personal costs and negative impacts on multiple areas of life. OCD is also associated with more functional impairment, more use of healthcare services and poorer quality of life than seen for any other patient group (including substance abuse and somatic illnesses). Additionally, OCD often precedes the onset of other common comorbid anxiety, mood, eating and substance abuse disorders and is strongly associated with suicide. The negative impact of OCD carries over into the families of patients and to society at large. In Denmark, anxiety disorders are estimated to be the most expensive of all disorders with annual costs estimated at 9.4 billion DKK, and they are the most common reason for forced retirement. The high personal and societal costs of OCD makes it a significant public health concern. Despite having been conceptualized as an illness with a poor prognosis, systematic reviews have consistently shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure and response prevention (ERP) is an effective treatment for OCD. This has made CBT the first choice for treating OCD in many mental health settings, as also recommended by the Danish Health Authorities. Nonetheless, a relatively large group of OCD patients does not benefit from CBT. Reviews of CBT-based treatment studies show that up to 50% of patients do not respond to CBT or terminate treatment prematurely. Despite the large number of non-responders, no significant progress for OCD treatment has been made since initial efficacy CBT trials in the 1970´ies. Thus, it is crucial to establish more effective psychotherapies (for the non-responders of CBT-based treatments) for OCD. Preliminary findings suggest that Acceptance and Commitment therapy (ACT) may be an effective treatment for OCD. ACT aims at increasing the participants valued actions in life (e.g. family life, work, sports), and the willingness to experience unpleasant emotions and thoughts. Both aspects are especially relevant for individuals with OCD, as a substantial amount of time is spent on OCD-behavior and avoiding the experience of distress and anxiety. To date, the support for ACT stems from smaller case studies and one controlled trial comparing ACT to Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR), including 79 individuals with OCD. The case studies showed that ACT was effective for OCD, and these positive results were also found in the controlled trial showing an effect size of 0.77 at post-treatment and of 1.10 at follow-up (3-months). Of the participants randomized to ACT, 46% showed significant symptom change compared to 13% of the participants who received PMR. Importantly, participants rated ACT as highly acceptable. However, serious limitations of the currently available evidence limit the conclusions that can be drawn on the effectiveness of ACT for OCD. First, the studies included relatively small samples. Second, PMR has not shown to be an effective treatment for OCD. Third, none of the previous studies have investigated the long-term effect of ACT on OCD. Thus, studies including a large sample and comparing the effect of ACT to the gold standard treatment, CBT, is warranted. Furthermore, studies should examine the long-term effect of ACT. In addition, previous studies have primarily been conducted in laboratory settings with maximal exclusion criteria which compromises the external validity. But OCD is commonly seen with comorbid depression and/or other anxiety diagnoses, so results based on highly selected patient samples treated in research clinics that specialize in OCD treatment are not generalizable to typical individuals with OCD or to clinics which treat most OCD patients. In sum, controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of ACT to CBT are warranted to confirm whether ACT is indeed the sought-after alternative to CBT.||What treatment works for whom? Another crucial step in order to improve the treatment for OCD is to consider individual patient characteristics in the composition of optimal treatment setups facilitating personalized treatment. This requires extensive knowledge of predictors and moderators of OCD treatment success. However, to date no reliable predictors or moderators have been identified. Previous predictor and moderator studies have suggested that attachment patterns and anxiety sensitivity may be related to treatment outcome for ACT and CBT. Accumulating studies also highlights the relevance of investigating biological markers in relation to OCD. However, very little is known about the role of biomarkers in OCD and in psychotherapy although studies are emerging.||Purpose This study aims to test the (long-term) effectiveness of ACT for OCD and to compare the effectiveness to CBT in a naturalistic clinical setting. Additionally, the aim is to identify reliable markers to guide efficient treatment choice by examining several theory-driven, putative predictors and moderators: 1) moderators which are theoretically connected to the two treatments (e.g. thought-action-fusion, anxiety sensitivity) 2) personality and interpersonal characteristics involved in the maintenance of OCD (e.g. emotion regulation, attachment style, personality traits) and 3) biomarkers known to be associated with comorbidity, chronicity and treatment refractivity. Finally, 4) the study will investigate the moderating effects of clinical and demographic characteristics (e.g. comorbid depression, gender, education, age). Main hypotheses 1: In the overall sample, both the ACT and CBT treatment will yield clinically significant results, indicated by a change in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores from pre- to posttreatment, with ACT and CBT being equally effective. 2: The effect at 6- and 12-months follow-up will be equal for ACT and CBT, measured with Y-BOCS. 3: Participants with comorbid depression at baseline will benefit more from ACT than CBT. Method The study is a double blinded, pragmatic, non-inferiority, parallel, multi-center randomized controlled trial of ACT vs CBT for OCD. In total, 180 patients are recruited from two regional MHS centers across Capital Region of Denmark and included in two intervention arms. The participants will be assessed with diagnostic interview and self-report measures at baseline, post-treatment, 6-months and 12-months follow-up. Randomization The randomization will be carried out based on an allocation list with permuted blocks using the Region´s secure system REDcap by a person not attached to the project.||Power calculations and data analysis To calculate the sample size, G*Power 3.1. was used. Based on previous studies, we expect that there will be a medium to large effect of the ACT-intervention (similar to the CBT-intervention), corresponding to effect sizes (Cohen's f) between 0.25 and 0.4. To detect a large effect (f = 0.4) between the two intervention groups at the four measurement points, we need a total sample of 34 in each arm to power the study sufficiently (80%) at a α-level of 0.05. To detect a medium effect (f = 0.25) a total sample size of 82 is needed. To be conservative, it is expected to find a medium effect. Previous clinical studies show a drop-out rate of 25%, thus a total sample of 124 is recruited at baseline.||Longitudinal data will be analyzed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) and Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) and an intend-to-treat sample including all randomized participants. Detection of the moderating value of the proposed variables will be analyzed in the two domains, using the method proposed by Kraemer. The possible moderators will be examined for individual effect sizes and then entered into a forward-stepwise regression model predicting differential treatment response. K-fold cross validation will be used to identify the number of variables to be included in the final moderator model in order to identify moderators in rank-order. Timeplan The project is planned to start in January 2019 and will run over 4 years.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT03244852,"Recently, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a potentially circuit-specific treatment for intractable OCD. DBS is programmable, allowing the clinician to ""reshape"" the volume of tissue activated within the standard ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) target.||However, VC/VS DBS' efficacy is limited by two major factors: imperfect targeting and a lack of decision rules for stimulation adjustment. The VC/VS target is not a single identifiable structure, but encompasses white matter of the internal capsule and gray matter of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In current practice for DBS in OCD, all patients are implanted at standard x,y,z coordinates in the VC/VS region. Due to this inter-subject anatomical variability, different fiber tracts are stimulated by ostensibly the ""same"" parameters in each subject, leading to variable outcomes. This investigation will identify aspects of VC/VS circuitry that may determine clinical response. The hypothesis is that good clinical outcomes may correlate to electrical field capture of either striatal gray matter or of white matter fibers connecting OFC to thalamus.||The current study looks to extend the neuroimaging investigation using anatomic white matter targeting, functional gray matter targeting and changes in changes in regional glucose metabolism of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with the long-term aim of identifying biomarkers that could improve outcomes of this expensive and invasive therapy.

NCT01794156,"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) affects 1-3% of the population and is the fourth most common mental disorder. It is characterized by a preoccupying obsessional doubt that harm, illness, disorder or bad luck, will occur if compulsive actions are not carried out to neutralize the risk. Treatments of choice include pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) either alone or in combination. Although these interventions are clinically effective, they usually do not reduce the obsessions to a sub-clinical level. There is a risk of relapse and even so a sizeable minority of people with OCD refuse or abandon treatment, and some specific subtypes of OCD show no or minimal response. CBT-as-usual, involves principally the administration of exposure and response prevention (E/RP). A cognitive psycho-education element may by added in line with current cognitive thinking that it is the appraisal the person attributes to the initial intrusive thought with engenders obsessional distress. Such cognitive treatment will focus on modifying the anxiety and beliefs about consequences following on from the initial obsessional preoccupation. A competing cognitive model termed the inference-based approach (IBA) developed by the principal investigator and co-workers offers an account of obsessions which focuses on the reasoning producing the initial obsessional doubt as the source of the OCD. In this model the obsessing begins at the point where the person crosses over from reality into the initial obsessional doubt since the doubt is not based on real perception but on a subjective narrative misleading the person to infer doubt where no doubt is required. Over the last 10 years, experimental, clinical and psychometric research studies (independently replicated) have supported the essential claims of the IBA and have led to development of inference-based therapy (IBT). A small scale randomized clinical trial, and clinical case studies have established IBT as a 'promising' intervention (according to American Psychological Association criteria) and shown that IBT seems to offer advantages over conventional CBT, particularly for treatment-resistant cases who over-invest in their obsessional convictions. The current randomized clinical trial will compare IBT to CBT as usual, and to a third active control condition of mindfulness. Mindfulness is a generic treatment shown effective in a range of psychiatric problems which seeks to calm thoughts by redirecting mental focus through meditative distancing. The mindfulness condition is a non-specific cognitive control for any confounding effect of mood change on symptom relief. CBT follows an 'appraisal' model either through restructuring appraisals and beliefs about the obsession or by de-dramatizing anxious expectations through exposure and reality testing (combined with E/RP). IBT seeks to change the reasoning leading up to the initial inference of doubt on the principle that eliminating the doubt logically and necessarily eliminates all anticipated consequences and accompanying obsessional anxiety. All three treatments will be manualized and administered by experienced professional therapists supervised by a co-investigator with an allegiance to one of the three approaches. The three treatment models operate on distinct processes and on separable stages of the obsessional chain, so therapy components will not overlap. The principal sites chosen will be Montreal Louis-H. Lafontaine Hospital and Gatineau Pierre-Janet Hospital. A total of 80 participants will be recruited over a five-year period into each treatment modality, giving a total of 240, which will permit robust conclusions even with weak effect sizes. Outcome evaluators will be blind to treatment modality and independent of therapists. All therapy will be delivered on an individual weekly basis until significant clinical improvement or up to a maximum of 26 weeks with a 6-month follow-up post-treatment. All parameters of treatment delivery will be identical across treatments. All sessions will be audio recorded and treatment integrity will be rated independently. Outcome measures will be standard DSM-IV based clinical diagnostic scales and also psychosocial measures of end-point functioning across life domains. Treatment process variables will be continuously monitored. Refusal and attrition are calculated at 16% and analysis will include intention to treat. The hypotheses are that: (1) all treatments will be effective in improving mood and reducing symptoms; (2) the IBT will be superior in terms of: (a) its consistent impact over all types of OCD; (b) its lower rate of relapse. The RCT will be the first of its kind in comparing these three active treatments and will impact on treatment of choice for OCD.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT02136953,"This study aims to determine if a standard, evidence-based 12-week aerobic exercise program results in significant reduction of obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and associated cognitive dysfunction as a stand-alone intervention and when combined with the first-line psychological treatment, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). There are 3 broad aims to this study: 1) to compare the relative efficacy of Exercise, CBT, and their combination (CBT+Ex) versus a non-treatment waitlist control (WL), 2) to examine the extent to which neuropsychological features of OCD improve following treatments, and 3) to determine the extent to which the BDNF gene and protein are a) associated with learning and cognitive factors, and b) moderate symptom and cognitive change across treatments.||The study design allows for a novel, well-powered and potentially landmark study on the impact of exercise on obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and cognitive functioning in OCD, both as a stand-alone treatment and when augmenting CBT. If this study can demonstrate that a short aerobic exercise program of 12 weeks duration can confer significant clinical gains for those suffering with OCD, then it could easily be translated into highly accessible, routine clinical care. Further, demonstration of improvement in OCD-associated cognitive dysfunction, given the refractory nature of the illness, would provide another avenue into the long-term enhancement of outcomes for this chronically affected population.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

The addition of these preliminary studies will allow investigators to obtain information in order to differentiate and code OCD-distress versus social anxiety and identify rituals related to OCD.||Research Material, Data, and Information to be collected:||Interviews, rating scales, video, audio, behavioral assessments, and heart rate will be obtained.||Preliminary Testing in Un-implanted Subjects: Automated Behavioral Measures of OCD-related Distress (i.e., obsessions and urge to ritualize) and Overt Rituals:||The Provocation OC task (Provoc) and the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) will be used to evoke OC-related distress and anxiety unrelated to OCD (e.g., performance anxiety), respectively. These tasks will be preceded by a neutral baseline (the subject may be asked to describe how they traveled to the clinic to the experimenter) and a positive affect induction, the Broad-Minded Affective Coping procedure (BMAC) a clinical technique that uses recalled positive autobiographical memories and mental imagery to elicit positive affect. Because anxiety and negative affect may have carryover effects, neutral baseline and BMAC will be presented prior to the non-OCD and OCD distress inductions. In the BMAC, subjects will be instructed to recall and describe a recent positive memory/experience. The order of Provoc and TSST will be counterbalanced across the subjects. Use of a conveyor belt may be used during the Provoc tasks to present the evoking stimuli. Simultaneously recorded measures are noted in the Table attached in Section S and include: AFAR, new suite of behavioral measures (shown as shaded), hand/arm movements and heart rate.||A third provocation task will be added to elicit overt rituals (e.g., handwashing) in the clinic. It will occur following the BMAC and TSST/Provoc tasks and a relaxation break.||Subjects will be asked to wash their hands at a sink in our clinic inside an exam room where their behaviors will be recorded using hardware-synchronized cameras: one, to capture frontal view of the face for AFAR; and another, to record full body movement for CPM. The investigators are aware of only one prior study of automated coding of compulsive behavior. In that study, a computer vision approach was able to discriminate subjects with OCD from healthy subjects on the basis of handwashing videos in which regions of interest (ROIs) were defined for objects (e.g., soap dispenser) used for handwashing. The investigators will combine this ROI paradigm with a CPM approach that captures hand and body movements. Dropouts from the ritual paradigm will be replaced.||These same tasks will also be performed on up to 4 subjects that have consented to receive a DBS implant on a separate protocol.

NCT03239210,"Many psychiatric disorders are associated with altered sensory experiences arising from within the body. Examples include increased experience of sensations or urges in muscles, skins, joints or visceral organs in Tic/Tourette's Disorders, OCD patients with symptoms of ""not just right experiences"" or disgust sensitivity, and other disorders such as trichotillomania or excoriation disorder. In OCD, these sensory phenomena occur in approximately half of patients, are associated with earlier age of onset, and may be harder to treat with classic cognitive-behavioral approaches to OCD. Of interest, sensory phenomena in OCD are associated with Tourette's syndrome and respond to pharmacological treatments primarily used for tics. As such, abnormal sensory processing may be a basic mechanism that links various psychiatric disorders.||The process of attending to body sensations is referred to as interoception, abnormality of which may be related to sensory phenomena. Research has revealed a cortical interoceptive circuit involving insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and sensorimotor cortex. Ondansetron (OND) is a good candidate for the modulation of the above-described interoceptive circuit. It is a selective 5-HT3 (serotonin) receptor antagonist that acts on both peripheral and central receptors. OND has long been used to treat nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, anesthesia, and opioid-induced emesis. It has also been used alone or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of both OCD and Tourette's disorder, showing some efficacy in small clinical trials. The mechanisms by which ondansetron improves symptoms in OCD and tic disorders are unknown, although the investigator's earlier study found that single doses of ondansetron reduce activation of insula and somatosensory cortex in healthy controls. As a follow-up to this work, the current protocol will compare the effects of 24 mg/day of ondansetron vs. placebo for 4 weeks in patients with OCD or Tic Disorders on symptoms and brain functioning.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT01956344,"The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve clinical outcomes for Hoarding Disorder (HD), a common and potentially debilitating condition that poses a severe public health burden. The PI has developed and tested a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that appears moderately effective, although there is clear room for improvement. In the present study, the investigators propose to merge this line of research with the PI's recent NIH-supported neuroimaging research that points to specific functional abnormalities in regions of interest (ROIs) related to cognitive and affective decisionmaking processes. Patients with HD n = 80) will be randomized to CBT or wait list (WL). At pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and post-treatment, patients will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an acquiring and discarding decision-making task that has been used successfully in the investigators' previous work. In addition, patients will complete a number of laboratory tasks designed to assess decision-making capacity and impairment. A group of healthy control (HC) participants (n = 40) will also complete these measures as a normative control group. The primary aim of the proposed study is to determine the extent to which the observed patterns of neural activity in HD change following CBT. Under this aim, the investigators predict that HD patients (vs.HCs) will show greater hemodynamic activity in ROIs associated with cognitive and affective aspects of decision-making. The investigators further predict that HD patients receiving CBT (vs. WL) will show decreased activity in those ROIs, and will no longer differ from HCs following CBT. A secondary aim of the proposed study is to determine the relationship between change in activity in brain regions of interest and hoarding-related symptoms and impairments. The investigators expect, that hemodynamic activity in the target ROIs will correlate with symptoms of HD and with performance on decision-making tasks; and that change in brain activity will correspond to both symptom and mechanism changes over the course of treatment. Finally, an exploratory aim is to explore, using both data-driven and model-constrained approaches, patterns of pre-treatment neural activity that predict response to CBT. The investigators predict that among treated HD patients, pre-treatment activity in the target ROIs will correlate significantly with HD symptom change from pre- to posttreatment. Results of the proposed study are expected to elucidate the neural mechanisms of successful response to CBT treatment for hoarding patients, and to set the stage for further treatment development and possible improvements in outcome for this disorder.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT04688554,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTI) have rapidly expanded since its emergence two decades ago. fMRI is well established as the single most powerful method for detecting changes in neural activity in vivo, albeit indirectly by detection of changes in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals that reflect hemodynamic changes subsequent to neural activity. A conventional fMRI experiment involves the comparison of two or more brain states followed by statistical tests to identify which brain regions were involved in a particular task. The identification of patterns of highly correlated low-frequency MRI signals in the resting brain provides a powerful approach to delineate and describe neural circuits, and an unprecedented ability to assess the manner in which distributed regions work together to achieve specific functions. Since the first reports of temporal correlations in BOLD baseline signals, several distinct cortical long-range networks have been identified and characterized in the resting state, including a default mode network. Moreover, observations of altered resting state connectivity in several disorders and as a function of behavior or cognitive skills suggest these correlations reflect an important level of brain organization and may play a fundamental role in the execution and maintenance of various brain functions. DTI is also an exceedingly important imaging modality that has elucidated the neural connectivity inherent between various cortical and subcortical structures. DTI is routinely used and has enhanced our understanding of functional connections between various parts of the brain. Prior to interventions, DTI is commonly obtained, so that interventionists can avoid critical circuitry. There is suggestion that both fMRI and DTI imaging is influenced by organic or interventional variables, however this is understudied. The neuroscientists and clinicians would greatly value information that would expand our working knowledge of the basic neural substrates and functional neural changes that occur in patients organically or after interventions. A non-invasive, non-interventional, observational study is needed to show the changes that happen to patients organically or in standard of care settings. A greater working understanding of the neural connectivity and changes that happen in the brain is of great future benefit to patients, science, and society as well as future therapeutic development such as post-stroke care, rehabilitation, post-traumatic brain injury, or post-treatment care in the brain that has previously been influenced by intervention or disease.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT04336228,"Previous studies have shown that 5-HT is strongly implicated in compulsive behaviours in experimental animals. Manipulation of 5-HT influences neuronal interactions underlying action selection. Reduced forebrain 5-HT causes perseveration and impairs goal-directed behaviour under reward but not punishment. Dysfunctional 5-HT neurotransmission has also been implicated in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) based on the selective efficacy of relatively high doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating this disorder. Hitherto, it is unknown whether there is a primary defect in the serotonergic system or whether SSRIs ameliorate symptoms by modulating other brain neurotransmitter pathways. So far, only one study of central 5-HT release in OCD patients has been conducted and its methodology may be questioned.||A number of behavioural and cognitive features of OCD, including endophenotype markers that appear to characterise the disorder have been determined. These include a shift in cognitive control from a goal-directed strategy to a habitual (stimulus-response, S-R) strategy, cognitive rigidity in terms of both reversal learning and attentional set-shifting, impaired response inhibition and planning, and a tendency to over-respond to spurious negative feedback in a probabilistic learning paradigm. Neural substrates of these deficits are being investigated using brain imaging methodologies based on magnetic resonance and preliminary evidence suggests an over-active medial prefrontal cortex-caudate nucleus circuits and underactive lateral prefrontal cortex-putamen circuits. However, little evidence exists that relates to the hypothesis of an over-active habit system in this disorder or to the role of serotonin in all these cognitive and behavioural deficits observed in OCD and compulsivity in general.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT01617083,"Accumulating evidence suggests that a subset of children with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) have a symptom course that is temporally associated with infections (group A Streptococcus, Mycoplasma, Borrelia burgordfi, etc.). The intent of this proposal is to test the hypotheses that: 1) this subset of children with OCD known as Pediatric Acute Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) and the specific subset associated with Streptococcus, PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcus), experience symptom onset and exacerbations due to autoimmune/inflammatory responses to infectious triggers and, 2) antibiotic treatment will reduce symptom severity. Investigators have reported improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients presenting with PANDAS following antibiotic treatment (Murphy & Pichichero, 2002; Snider, Lougee, Slattery et al., 2005). Difficulties with study design and small sample size of early antibiotic trials limit the influence of their findings (Kurlan & Kaplan, 2004) although anecdotally, many families report often dramatic improvements in OCD symptoms after antibiotic therapy.||The proposed study is a 4 week double-blind placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of azithromycin once daily on OCD symptom severity in children ages 4-14 years presenting with the PANS phenotype. An 8 week open label phase will be offered to all subjects completing the 1-month trial to assess longer term efficacy and tolerability (12 weeks total antibiotics for those on active, 8 weeks for those on placebo). At the end of week 8, the child can transition to best clinical care practice (cognitive behavioral therapy, additional medication trials, etc) if not fully remitted. The rate and timing of any relapse will be assessed but are not the primary outcome variables. Evaluations will consist of: 1) semi-structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews and rating scales to establish psychiatric diagnoses and monitor severity of psychiatric symptoms, particularly obsessive compulsive behavior and tics; 2) parent and child-report questionnaires to elicit information regarding infections and clinical correlates of PANS attributes; 3) physical and neurological examinations; and 4) laboratory studies.||Aim 1: To compare, in randomized controlled fashion, placebo vs. antibiotic on changes in overall symptom severity for obsessive-compulsive symptoms among children with PANS phenotype. Changes from baseline and clinical status at end of study will be compared for the study arms. Primary endpoint will be change on the Children's Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive scale (CY-BOCS). Secondary measures of interest include severity and improvement measures on the Clinical Global Impression Severity/Improvement scale, quality of life measures, and weekly ratings of mood, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity and tic symptoms. Hypothesis: Children receiving antibiotic will show significantly greater overall improvement in severity compared with placebo. Children that meet PANDAS/PANS criteria and have current OCD symptoms of less than 6 months duration will be enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of azithromycin for 4 weeks. Subjects will be followed weekly during the 3 months (4-week antibiotic treatment trial, 8 weeks open label treatment). Although earlier trials have had mixed results, these studies have primarily enrolled subjects with longer illness durations and used traditional prophylactic doses in contrast to the standard treatment dose of this study. Since treatment doses of antibiotic decrease antigenic load, one can speculate that treatment level doses, rather than prophylactic doses, may best attenuate neuropsychiatric sequelae. Secondary neuromodulating or immune modulating properties at higher dose of antibiotics may also be a possible mode of therapeutic action. The timing of treatment response and moderators and predictors of response will also be assessed.||Aim 2: To assess immune risk factors in children with PANDAS/PANS. The data and biological specimens (blood, cultures, etc) for all subjects consented for Aim 1 will, be entered into a database and repository to assess further these clinical phenotypes. Subjects that do not qualify for randomization (medication allergy or current long term antibiotic therapy) or decline randomization (e.g. travel required for future visits) will be permitted to contribute to Aim 2, i.e. collection of baseline symptom severity and immune marker assessment. Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that children with sudden onset of OCD and whose subsequent course shows dramatic fluctuations will have evidence of immune risk factors that predisposes to this presentation. Certain subject characteristics such as age, duration of illness, characteristics of exacerbation episodes, type and number of prior infections, and co-occurring disorders may influence treatment response. Immunologic markers that may help with determining pathobiology and treatment response will be explored including pathogen detection array to identify potential infectious triggers, cytokine array to explore inflammatory processes and specific antibody assay to assess potential mediators. In order to differentiate those children that may most benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis from those that do not benefit, analytic strategies to refine an antibiotic-responsive phenotype will be explored.||Rationale: Based on the PI's observations from research and clinical patients being referred for PANDAS (60 patients per year), patients have had most improvement when higher doses of antibiotics are used, often relapsing on prophylactic doses. The best response rates have been antibiotics designed to treat beta lactamase co-pathogens such as azithromycin, cephalosporins or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Observed response rates are typically within 3 weeks although some subjects appear to take longer to gain response. These observations deserve further study. Azithromycin was chosen due to improved tolerance, once daily dosing regimen, coverage against other microbes implicated in PANS and low risk for allergic reaction or exclusion.||Randomization: Study medication and matching placebo will be provided by the research pharmacy. Some of the services provided will include blinding of study drug, packaging and labeling, and randomization. Subjects who are randomized will receive either antibiotic or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Both investigator and study participant will be blinded to the treatment assignment. Randomization will not be revealed to the investigator or the study participants until all participants have completed the study or in the event of serious adverse event (SAE).||Dosing: Azithromycin or placebo every 24 hours will be dispensed. Antibiotic will be transferred to identical bottles as placebo and dispensed without the manufacturer label. Labels will be identical with matching dose volumes for each. Flavor, color and texture will be matched to best of ability. Participants and parents will be instructed to not discuss the actual medication with anyone in the study team except the designated person dispensing the medication.||Study participation is entirely voluntary. If at any time a participant wishes to discontinue the use of study medication, they can notify the study coordinator and if the family is willing, they can choose to enter the naturalistic phase or discontinue the study.||Naturalistic Observation Phase: After the subject's completion of the active phase of the study (baseline to end of week 12 as determined by subject eligibility, medication tolerance, etc), the family will be given the choice to opt in or opt out of a naturalistic follow up on a monthly basis until end of week 52. The family will be provided a monthly PANS scale and questionnaire regarding the child's current treatment. Depending on which option works best for them, they can return by the forms by mail or complete online.||Compliance Monitoring: Azithromycin, with daily dosing, has higher rates of adherence than other antibiotics with more frequent dosing. The parent of the child will be educated about optimal dosing and compliance. Each unit dose will be labeled specifically with the participants identification number. The clinical coordinator will document each batch of medication on the dispensing log. Each batch of study medication will include supply until next scheduled visit plus one week to cover any difficulty returning to study in the scheduled interval. All study medication will be accounted for throughout the study by the investigator or the designee.||End of Treatment Alternatives: Standard of care treatment options are unavailable for the initial 8 weeks, after which point families will have multiple options for post-study care if needed. Until better guidelines are developed, children in the PANDAS/PANS subgroup should also be given the chance to benefit from evidence based treatments that may lessen the severity of a future flare up. From our previous work (Storch, Murphy, Geffken et al., 2006), we believe that remaining OCD symptoms are best treated with CBT unless the child is still too severe to engage in therapy. CBT can help children remodel automatic responses to obsessions, teach skills that should prove helpful if symptoms do recur and also help families with behavioral strategies to lessen the risk of disrupted functioning and accommodation. Children often report feeling empowered from coping, relaxation, and resiliency skills learned in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Antidepressants approved for OCD are an option to consider for those that appear to have a chronic stable course but many youth with a PANS presentation are incapacitated by these sudden and severe symptoms, with many parents feeling too desperate (Murphy, observations) to wait the typical 10-12 weeks for SSRIs to achieve full efficacy. Many of these children are highly sensitive to usual starting doses (Murphy, Storch, & Strawser, 2006) but do well when started on a low dose (e.g. sertraline at 6.25mg) and gradually increased as tolerated. Patients with tics respond well to a variety of evidence based pharmacologic agents and behavioral treatments if needed due to symptom severity and impairment. Following the study all subjects with incomplete remission will be referred for CBT in the outpatient clinics or the community based on parent preference. The investigative team has considerable experience in the application of this approach for pediatric OCD (Murphy et al., 2007) and collaborates closely with outpatient providers.||Adverse effects: Every effort should be made to identify prior history of adverse effects to antibiotics prior to the randomization phase (exclusion criterion). In the event of Candidiasis, other opportunistic overgrowth or allergic reaction, the recommendations by the primary care physician (PCP) of the child will be followed. As this adverse event is unlikely except during treatment with antibiotics, blinding will be compromised and the child will be considered a drop due to adverse event. Open label probiotics will be provided to subjects in both study arms in all phases to be taken daily. In the event of an SAE, the blind should be broken only if knowing the treatment status is of significance to the course of treatment. If at any time the blinding becomes otherwise compromised, the subject will exit the randomized control trial (RCT) portion of the study. The date, time, and reason or situation surrounding unblinding must be documented as completely as possible. All SAEs should also be reported to the institutional review board (IRB) as soon as possible.

NCT00517244,"Anxiety disorders are among the most common childhood disorders. Although anxiety is a normal part of life and growing up, for some children this anxiety becomes chronic, relentless, and progressively worse if left untreated. Physical symptoms typically accompany the intense anxiety caused by the disorder, and may include blushing, profuse sweating, trembling, nausea, and difficulty talking. Effective treatments for anxiety disorders are available, and research continues to yield new, improved therapies that can help most people with anxiety disorders to lead productive, fulfilling lives. This study will look at similarities and differences in family processes and child temperament among children with and without symptoms of anxiety disorders. Results from this study may improve future treatment of children with anxiety disorders.||Families participating in this observational study will be mailed parent and child questionnaires that should be completed prior to the first study session. The child questionnaires will ask for information regarding the child's feelings and family interactions. Parent questionnaires will ask for information about their own personal feelings as well as the child's feelings, symptoms, and behaviors. Study participation will last 2 days. On the first day of the study, families will undergo a 3-hour diagnostic interview in which questions similar to those found on the questionnaires will be revisited. On the second day, mothers and their children will participate in three different observation tasks that explore how families interact and respond to certain situations. These tasks may include discussing certain anxiety-provoking situations, putting puzzles together, and creating an ending to a story. Before each task, the child will be placed alone in a separate room where the child will be asked to relax. Throughout the tasks, the child's heart rate and breathing will be recorded by a machine. The tasks will be videotaped but will be viewed only by research staff for data analysis purposes and to ensure that all safety procedures were followed. Upon study completion, if it appears that a child has an anxiety disorder, parents of the child will be notified and will receive treatment referrals as needed.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT03182101,"Empirically supported behavioral treatments cannot be effectively disseminated without understanding key quality components. Mechanism-informed quality measures have extraordinary potential to enhance pragmatism by eliminating unnecessary elements and targeting multiple problems and populations, and to enhance predictive value by detecting mechanism engagement early in treatment. Community Mental Health Agencies (CMHAs), however, are often ill-equipped to use such measures of treatment quality due to burden and limited resources. Exposure therapy for anxiety is an ideal prototype for testing a practical, mechanism-informed quality measure in CMHAs given its potential for public health impact and clear theory of mechanism. The Exposure Guide (EG), a brief quality tool measuring therapist behaviors and mechanism, was developed based on microanalytic coded data showing a strong link between therapist behavior and patient outcome across three RCTs of exposure therapy in youth. Initial psychometrics for the EG using these RCT data are promising showing reliability, construct validity, and predictive validity, and pilot data suggests it may be acceptable and feasible in a community setting. Building upon these findings, we propose to test this novel measure of exposure quality, EG, in a community setting including its reliability and validity, its pragmatism, and which community end-users can become reliable and valid reporters. Therapists at a large local CMHA (N = 40) treating anxious youth and young adults ages 5-25 (N = 300) will participate in this study. The EG will be completed by 1) agency supervisors monthly, 2) therapists per session, 3) patient/families per session, and 4) study raters per session. Results from this study will establish an innovative model for measuring therapeutic elements that trigger mechanism of change in real-world therapy as well as inform future use of EG as a training tool to improve exposure quality in community settings.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT02320266,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an FDA approved, and widely used method for treating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), Essential Tremor (ET), Dystonia and Obsessive Compulsive disorder (OCD). Over 100,000 patients worldwide have now been implanted with DBS devices. Current approved methods to locate the DBS target regions in the brain (subthalamic nucleus (STN) for PD) use a combination of stereotactic imaging techniques and measurements of the electrical activity of brain cells. As part of the standard clinical technique, electrical data are collected from individual nerve cells --in a procedure called microelectrode recording (MER). The target brain region emits unique electrical signals that are detected by MER during the standard DBS surgery. MER is done at stops along the way to the target. At the stops during DBS surgery, additional electrical data that are generated in response to sound will be collected. Regions of the brain that have a decreased response after repeated sound (auditory gating) may be important DBS targets for improving thinking. The aims are to:(Aim 1A) during DBS surgery, in addition to EEG, use microelectrodes in the brain to measure electrical activity with single unit activity (SUA) and local field potentials (LFP) to find brain regions along the path to the DBS target where auditory gating occurs (Aim 1A) and then determine if stimulation of the identified region(s) alters auditory gating measured by EEG(Aim 1B); and (Aim 2) measure electrical activity at the scalp with electroencephalography (EEG) to characterize auditory gating in patients before and after DBS surgery and also a healthy control population.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT01506206,"The study will take place at a clinical office in the Charlestown Navy Yard (CNY), and will consist of 1 4 or 4.5-hour visit. Study staff will schedule a convenient time for patients to arrive, or the research visit may be paired with a regularly scheduled DBS programming visit. A member of the Division of Neurotherapeutics authorized to manipulate DBS programming will turn the device ON and OFF during the study. The subject's therapeutic parameters of the DBS system will not be changed. The subject will be asked to complete two impulsivity questionnaires: UPPS+P Impulsive Behavior Scale and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). Following these questionnaires, DBS stimulation will be turned off and a member of the study staff will teach the subjects to perform the following tasks on the computer:||Stop-Signal Task To measure ""impulsive action,"" we will use the stop-signal task (SST), a well-validated measure of response inhibition known to be impaired in substance abusers. In each of the 192 trials (3 blocks of 64; 10s interval between blocks, 2s ISI), subjects see a fixation cue (250ms) that is replaced by a shape (square or circle). Participants are told to make a shape judgment by pressing the appropriate computer key. On no-signal trials (75%), subjects are instructed to respond to the stimulus as fast and accurately as possible. On stop-signal trials (25%), the stimulus is followed by an auditory stop signal, and subjects are instructed to withhold responding. On stop-signal trials, a stop signal is presented after a variable delay (SSD), initially set at 250 msec and adjusted continuously with a staircase procedure by 50ms depending on whether inhibition is successful (increases) or unsuccessful (decreases). The paradigm will be administered using precompiled software provided by Gordon Logan, which automatically analyzes all relevant dependent variables (e.g stop-signal reaction time [SSRT] and GoRT). This task takes approximately 20 minutes.||Rewarded Variant This task is a variant of the above, with an inclusion of a ""points possible cue"" (2 or 50 points) for 500 ms, and followed by a brief delay (500-1500 ms) prior to the target. The task will be presented in 13 blocks. The first contains only go trials, from which the initial SSD will be calculated. The 12 subsequent blocks each consist of 40 trials; 18 standard go trials, 12 high reward (HR) go trials, 6 standard stop trials, and 4 HR stop trials, presented in random order. The SSD will be determined by a simple staircase-tracking algorithm as described by Logan, in which the SSD is adjusted up or down by 25 ms in order to establish an SSD that produces 50% accuracy of successful performance, with separate staircases calculated for the HR and standard trials. Outcome measures are the standard and high reward GoRTs, the standard and HR SSRTs, and the proportion of responses that would have been unsuccessfully stopped on HR trials if the standard SSD were utilized instead of the HR SSD.||Rewarded Go/NoGo Task In this task, participants are asked to make, or withhold, a button press to one of six stimuli (shapes), that correspond to six trial types: Go (no reward), Go (low reward), Go (high reward), NoGo (no reward), NoGo (low reward), NoGo (high reward). Participants are asked to press a button for Go stimuli and withhold a button press for NoGo stimuli. The ratio of Go stimuli to NoGo stimuli is approximately 15:1. Participants win money for correctly pressing a button for Go stimuli and for withholding a response for NoGo stimuli; conversely, they lose money for failing to respond to a Go stimuli or for failing to withhold a response to NoGo stimuli. There are 1260 trials, and each lasts 1 second. The task takes about 20 minutes to complete. Task may be administered without reward contingencies. In this case, there will only be two trial types: Go and NoGo.||Delay Discounting Task To measure ""impulsive choice"" we will use a delay-discounting (DD) paradigm101. On each trial, participants make a binary choice between a smaller/sooner and a larger/later reward. The delay of the sooner reward is set as today, 2 weeks, & 1 month; the delay of the later reward ranges from 2 to 6 weeks after the early reward. The sooner reward is from 1% to 50% less than the late reward (max = $40). Participants will complete approximately 80 trials. Participants are told that two of their choices will be randomly selected for payout at the appropriate time. Outcome variables include the proportion of choices for immediate/sooner rewards, as well as discounting parameter k, obtained by fitting choice data for each subject to a hyperbolic discount function. The task takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.||30 minutes after turning OFF DBS stimulation, participants will either remain in the OFF condition or will have the DBS turned ON, depending on their counter-balanced condition assignment. Subjects will complete the tasks above in the first condition. Following task completion, subjects will have DBS stimulation turned OFF or ON (again, depending on condition assignment). After 30 minutes, participants will complete the same tasks in the second condition. Following retesting, participants that were in the OFF condition will return to ON DBS stimulation.||We will be using the implanted pulse generator to deliver a safe current. Because we are not changing the therapeutic parameters of stimulation, subjects should not experience any changes during the ON condition. Should any discomfort arise in the OFF condition, the subject will be able to terminate the study and return to the ON condition immediately. The computer will register the subject's performance.||Electroencephalography recordings (EEG) will be acquired during performance of the aforementioned tasks.

NCT03528109,"Anxiety disorders are a significant public health problem that cause suffering for youth and their families, derail normal childhood development, and when left untreated persist into adulthood with high societal costs. Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) including exposure therapy is the treatment of choice, yet multiple barriers limit access to care. Even for families with access to care, traditional provider-centered (office based) treatment presents challenges and can limit effectiveness for many youth and families. Home- and Community-based exposure therapy is efficacious for patients who previously did not improve with provider-centered services, and input from family stakeholders suggests that treatment in these settings is an optimal match for their needs. Patient-centered models involving home visits and provider teams have consistently demonstrated increased treatment accessibility and engagement. However, there has been no comprehensive comparison of exposure delivered by patient-centered teams using home visits versus by provider-centered office visits alone for childhood anxiety. The absence of comparative effectiveness research (CER) data impedes targeted use of patient centered versus traditional outpatient treatment and would better allocate limited resources, provide the best quality care, and help patients and families make educated decisions about their treatment choices. Telehealth has strong evidence for effectiveness for youth with anxiety and OCD when delivered by a licensed provider, with treatment responder rates ranging from 73-82% (Carpenter, et al., 2018; Comer et al., 2017; Storch et al., 2011). Although traditional telehealth treatments can address barriers associated with in-person treatment, it has yet to be leveraged to increase service capacity. The overall goal of this proposal is to compare two models of service delivery, patient-centered delivery (utilizing novel deployment of personnel both in-home and via telehealth) vs. traditional provider-centered delivery, of CBT in youth ages 5-18 receiving exposure therapy for anxiety. A total of 379 children will be treated, with 166 (or 167) children randomly assigned to provider-centered, 166 (or 167) assigned to patient-centered in-home, and 46 assigned to patient-centered telehealth treatment conditions. The patient-centered telehealth condition was added in 2020 in response the COVID-19 global pandemic. Telehealth treatment models are a necessary health system adaptation in the current health crisis, but also may improve access to care post pandemic. We hope including telehealth as a comparator in our service delivery compared effectiveness trial will be highly informative and relevant for the future mental healthcare landscape.||A trained independent evaluator (IE) blind to condition will measure patient and family treatment engagement, anxiety symptoms/severity, and functional impairment at baseline, during active treatment at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24, and 3- and 6-month follow-up after acute treatment. The primary aims are to compare the relative effectiveness of patient-centered vs. provider-centered treatment for: 1) improving family treatment engagement/satisfaction, 2) reducing anxiety symptoms, and 3) reducing associated disability (quality of life and functional impairment). Secondary outcomes are to understand moderators of treatment response including: severity of illness, caregiver burden/family accommodation, and barriers to treatment access and to explore group differences in time course of response, durability of treatment gains, provider volume/capacity and efficiency in patient centered versus provider centered treatment.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT00742664,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms in youth with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) are commonly present and associated with considerable functional impairment to the child and his/her family. Although pharmacological and behavioral treatments exist that target OC symptoms among youth without PWS, these treatments have not been systematically adapted for this population nor rigorously tested. Furthermore, although pharmacological interventions have shown promise in PWS in case reports, the efficacy is modest and the potential for side effects has been documented in youth with and without PWS. Given that behavioral treatment for OC symptoms has superior efficacy to pharmacotherapy in youth without PWS, without the accompanying risk for adverse side effects, it follows that an adapted version of this modality may hold promise in treating clinically problematic OC symptoms in youth with PWS.||Objectives: There are two primary study objectives: First, to develop a well-specified behaviorally oriented psychotherapy protocol that addresses OC symptoms, both food and non-food related, in youth with PWS. Second, to conduct a randomized wait-list controlled trial of the protocol in 12 youth with PWS.||Study Design: There will be two phases to this study: Phase I - Therapy development/manual writing and a small open trial; and Phase II - a small wait-list controlled pilot trial. Briefly, Phase I will concentrate on developing the treatment protocol through a process that draws on expert opinion coupled with focused interviews with parents. Based on this, a preliminary manual developed by the investigators will be piloted in 6 youth with PWS. Phase II will involve a preliminary test of the protocol in a sample of 12 families. This trial will focus primarily on feasibility issues (versus efficacy) in order to refine the manual, develop process measures to evaluate therapist's competence and adherence to manualized guidelines, train evaluators in assessment tasks, and develop data collection and coding systems. Six youth will be randomized to receive the treatment protocol, while 6 will participate in a wait-list of an equivalent time period.

NCT03953014,"Background and Rationale:||Antidepressants such as serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are frequently prescribed to children to manage major depressive and anxiety disorders. Although SSRIs are thought to be generally effective and well-tolerated in children, 10%- 20% of children treated with SSRIs experience behavioral disinhibition (i.e. activation, hyperactivity, impulsivity, insomnia) that can lead to devastating consequences (e.g. suicidal impulses, violence). There are currently no tools available to assist healthcare providers in predicting which children will experience behavioral disinhibition as a result of SSRI treatment.||Research Question:||Do children who experience SSRI-induced behavioral disinhibition (SIBD) have a distinct pharmacogenetic profile relative to children who do not have these adverse experiences?||Methodology:||Using a retrospective cohort study design, 120 SSRI-treated children diagnose with major depression, anxiety and OCD, aged 6 to 17 years of aged will be recruited from Child and Adolescent Addiction, Mental Health & Psychiatry (CAAMHP) Program in Calgary.

NCT03929406,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become the standard functional neurosurgery treatment for drug resistant Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. It has also demonstrated its efficacy to treat various movement disorders as well as neurological and psychiatric disorders. The subthalamic nucleus (STN), the globus pallidus internal (GPi) or the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) are the major targets of DBS.||Access to pathological brain tissue in living PD patients or other neurological diseases is a key issue for the discovery of new therapeutic targets and the development of potential curative therapies. In this context, DBS offers a unique access to the pathological brain. In the standard surgical procedure, to prepare the way for the final electrode, the surgeon uses a dilator that is lowered gently through the cerebral parenchyma up to the target. It has been shown that during this step, brain tissue fragments adhere to the extremity of the dilator. However, the major drawback of the standard dilator lies in the fact that its end is in contact with several brain regions before reaching the targeted nucleus. Therefore, it is difficult to guarantee the origin of the collected tissue micro-fragments. In order to optimize the specificity of the harvested imprints, the investgator will use a dedicated CE marked medical device that consists of a guide tube and a stylet instead of the dilator used in DBS surgical procedure. The objective of this study is to validate brain tissue imprints collection in PD, ET, DYS, OCD and TS.||The BTI will be specifically collected from the targeted implantation site corresponding to the STN, the GPi and the VIM. Moreover, the tip of the electrode (and therefore the BTI) often reaches the substantia negra pars compacta (SNpc) because of its proximity with the STN. The ability to perform BTI in the SNpc is of highly interest since it is the structure containing the neurons that degenerate gradually and massively throughout the pathological process of Parkinson's disease.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00001658,"An increasing body of evidence suggests that Group A beta-Hemolytic Streptococcal throat infections (GABHS) may trigger the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tic disorder in certain vulnerable children via an autoimmune process. In this subgroup of children with childhood-onset OCD and tic disorders, preliminary data suggest some children have a rapid response to amoxicillin. After only 24 to 48 hours of treatment, they have a dramatic reduction in OC symptoms and tics. To date, we have observed this phenomenon in at least 5 children, each of whom relapsed when the amoxicillin was stopped. These observations raise a number of questions, including whether or not amoxicillin has a direct central nervous system (CNS) effect or an indirect effect through perturbations of the immune system (e.g., cytokine shifts).||The purpose of this study is to determine if amoxicillin is an effective treatment for PANDAS, as well as examining possible mechanisms of this effect.

A member of the Division of Neurotherapeutics authorized to manipulate DBS programming will turn the device on and off during the study. The subject's therapeutic parameters of the DBS system will not be changed. The subject will be asked to complete four self-report questionnaires: the Temporal Experience of Pleasure questionnaire, the Chapman Anhedonia Questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSS) and the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ). Following these questionnaires, a member of the study staff will teach the subjects to perform the following tasks on the computer:||Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) To measure motivation to work for rewards, we will use the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT or ""effort""). The EEfRT is a multi-trial computer-based task that assess an individual's willingness to expend effort for the chance to earn monetary rewards developed by Michael Treadway and David Zald at Vanderbilt University (Treadway et al., 2009). On each trial, subjects are given an opportunity to choose between two different task difficulty levels in order to obtain monetary rewards. For all trials, subjects must make repeated manual button presses in a set period of time. Each button press raises the level of a virtual ""bar"" viewed onscreen by the subject. Subjects will be eligible to win the money allotted for each trial if they are able to raise the bar to the ""top"" within the prescribed time period. This button-press task has two levels of difficulty: referred to henceforth as the 'hard task' or 'easy task'. Successful completion of hard task trials requires the subject to make 100 button presses, using the non-dominant pinky finger within 30 seconds, while successful completion of easy task trials requires the subject to make 30 button presses, using the dominant index finger within 10 seconds.||For easy task choices, subjects are eligible to win the same amount on each trial if they successfully complete the task. For hard task choices, subjects are eligible to win an amount that varies per trial. Subjects are not guaranteed to win the stated reward if they complete the task; some trials are 'win' trials, in which the subject receives the stated reward amount, while others are 'no win' trials, in which the subject receives no money for that trial. To help subjects determine which trials are more likely to be win trials, subjects are provided with probability cues at the beginning of each trial. Trials have three levels of probability: 88% probability of being a win trial, 50% and 12%. There are equal proportions of each probability level across the experiment. Each level of probability appears once in conjunction with each level of reward value for the hard task.||At the beginning of the task, subjects are provided with a detailed set of instructions, and an opportunity to play 4 practice trials. Subjects are then told that they will have twenty (20) minutes to play as many trials as they can. Easy Task choices take approximately 15 seconds, whereas Hard Task choices take approximately 30 seconds. Therefore, the number of trials that the subject is able to play will depend in part on the choices that she makes. This means that making more Hard Task trials early-on in the experiment will result in fewer trials total, which may mean that the subject does not get a chance to play high-value, high-probability trials that could appear towards the end of the playing time. This trade-off is explained clearly to the subject. The goal of this trade-off is to ensure that neither a strategy of always choosing the easy or the hard option can lead to optimal performance on the task. Moreover, the complexity of variables (with varying monetary reward levels, probability, and loss of time for future trials), does not lend itself to a formal calculation of an optimal response selection, forcing Subjects to make a relatively rapid decision, that we believe taps individual differences in the willingness to expend effort for a given level of expected reward value.||At the end of the task, two trials are randomly selected that will be added to the subject's compensation as a reward incentive. Subjects therefore may earn additional funds in incentive performance compensation each time they complete the EEfRT.||Clock Task The ""clock task"" is an additional reward task that assesses reward learning developed by Michael Frank and colleagues (Moustafa et al., 2008; Frank et al., 2009). For this task, participants observe a clock arm that completes a revolution over the course of 5 seconds, and participants are instructed to press a key to stop the clock at any time in an attempt to win points. The amount of points won varies depending on RT, and participants must use trial-and-error strategies to learn when to stop the clock so as to maximize points received. To prevent subjects form explicitly learning reward values associated with a specific location on the clock face, reward values at any given point along the clock face are randomized within +/- 5 points. At the end of the task, subjects may redeem points for a small amount of additional compensation, each time they complete the task. This task takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.||30 minutes after turning OFF DBS stimulation, participants will either remain in the OFF condition or will have the DBS turned ON, depending on their counter-balanced condition assignment. Subject assignment will alternate sequentially. Subjects will complete the tasks above in the first condition.

NCT02855580,"This project will assess the feasibility of implementing pharmacogenomic testing (PGX) for specific genes involved in the metabolism of antidepressants (CYP2D6 and CYP2C19) into the child psychiatry clinic at UF.||Although not widely implemented to date, naturalistic studies in adult psychiatry populations have shown that PGX testing can improve patient outcomes, increase medication adherence, and reduce costs. However, there have been no studies of psychiatry-focused PGX testing in children. One in every four children and adolescents suffers from a mental illness (more than half have a mood or anxiety disorder) that is severe enough to impact their functioning at school, at home, or in other important areas. Although psychotherapy remains the first line treatment for children with mild or uncomplicated symptoms, the use of psychotropic medications in children has increased steadily over the last decade. These medications are effective for many children, but carry a substantial risk of side effects, including gastrointestinal, cognitive, systemic, and psychiatric (including treatment emergent suicidal ideation). For most treatment responders, improvement is typically seen four to eight weeks after the target dose has been achieved (twelve weeks for obsessive compulsive disorder). Thus, identifying the best medication options prior to treatment initiation could decrease the likelihood of side effects severe enough to require medication discontinuation or changes, and minimize the time to response. In this study, 50 children and adolescents with major depression, anxiety, or obsessive compulsive disorders who are beginning treatment with a new antidepressant will be recruited and PGX testing will be conducted. Twenty five children will be randomized to receive PGX testing prior to starting/changing medications and 25 to receive treatment as usual (these children will receive their PGX results at the end of 12 weeks). Members of the UF Health Personalized Medicine Program will provide education to the prescribing clinicians about PGX testing and will create patient-specific consultations regarding the PGX results.||Assess clinicians' and parents' willingness to use PGX testing in making treatment decisions, as well as their knowledge and beliefs about PGX testing (pre-and post-study).

NCT04575805,"Cognitive behavioral therapy, consisting of exposure and response prevention and cognitive restructuring, is still one of the most effective treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder. However, some patients do not fully benefit from the treatment. This condition results in more search for novel approaches that can contribute to effectiveness of standard treatments. In this regard, the use of technology-based methods in recent researches is noteworthy. Cognitive bias modification (CBM) is one of these current efforts of technology-based methods. CBM involves computerized tasks designed to modify some cognitive biases such as attention and interpretation associated with psychopathology, particularly anxiety disorders. Researches have generally demonstrated that cognitive bias modification can be effective way to alter cognitive biases and to reduce anxiety symptoms. In recent years, there have been also some studies to investigate the potential effects of cognitive bias modification for obsessive compulsive disorder.The results of both CBM-Interpretation (CBM-I) and CBM-Attention (CBM-A) studies have shown that it is an effective and promising method in reducing cognitive biases in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Although these studies are highly informative, they do not provide information about the causal role one bias has during the operation of another. In recent years, there has been a growing consensus that both biases arise from the same system, thereby, it is possible that modifying the system to alter one bias (e.g., attention), will also impact on the presence of the other bias.). In line with this notion, there are a couple of studies to test the effect of Combined Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM-C) which is combination of both CBM-A and CBM-I in intervention programs. The results of these studies are generally very positive. Although it is well established that attention bias and interpretation bias each have a key role in the development and maintenance of OCD, only one bias is targeted in CBM studies of OCD. Considering that a ""combined cognitive bias"" may contribute to the maintenance of several disorders, in order to try to maximise the potential clinical impact, the present research aims at exploring whether the combination of the CBM-A and CBM-I procedures would be more effective in reducing cognitive biases and OC symptoms than either alone. It is expected that internet-delivered CBM-C (iCBM-C) will result in superior treatment outcomes as indexed by internet-delivered CBM-I intervention only (iCBM-I), internet-delivered CBM-A intervention only (iCBM-A), and wait-list control (WLC).",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT04026152,"Exercise is a time- and cost-efficient alternative to other evidence-based treatments for anxiety (e.g., psychotherapy, pharmaceutical) that also is associated with physical health benefits. Exercise protocols such as resistance training (RT) are efficacious at reducing symptoms of anxiety-related disorders (ARDs); however, there are challenges associated with effectively implementing such protocols, most notably, that people with ARDs may avoid physical activity, including exercise. Emerging research suggests that people with ARDs experience exercise-specific anxiety (e.g., exercise-related worries, fear of physical sensations associated with exercise) and identify this exercise anxiety as a major contributor to their exercise avoidance. Consequently, exercise interventions for people with ARDs may need to target exercise anxiety to support long-term exercise engagement. Evidence-based cognitive-behavioural techniques (CBT), such as cognitive restructuring, and exposure, can alter maladaptive thinking and behavioural patterns associated with anxiety. Teaching people with ARDs how to apply CBT techniques to exercise anxiety could help increase and support their exercise behaviour; however, research has not been conducted to test this hypothesis. The primary purpose of this proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to examine whether adding a form of CBT (i.e., the Unified Protocol) to a program for people with ARDs is associated with superior exercise engagement as compared to groups that do not receive this intervention. This proposed RCT will also evaluate potential predictors of exercise frequency for people with ARDs, such as exercise knowledge, exercise self-efficacy, and exercise motivation. A total of 90 physically inactive participants with ARDs will be randomized into a month of one of the following conditions: Unified Protocol + RT, RT, or waitlist (WL). All participants (except WL) will receive and follow a comprehensive instructional exercise program, consisting of three weekly full body RT workouts. Participants in both RT groups will also receive the guidance of a personal trainer during their first month of following this program. Participants in both RT groups will complete three exercise sessions each week for 4 weeks and these sessions will be composed of personal trainer and independent exercise. Participants in the Unified Protocol +RT condition will also receive four weekly individual CBT sessions designed to support adherence to the exercise sessions. Exercise frequency will be measured using the number of recorded exercise sessions (at least 30 minutes in length) and physical activity will be measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. Presence and severity of ARDs will be assessed using the Structured Clinical Administered Interview for the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (SCID-5) as well as disorder-specific self-report measures. Exercise anxiety will also be measured using a questionnaire designed for this study. Exercise frequency, anxiety disorder-specific severity, and exercise anxiety will be measured at baseline, weekly during the first month of exercise, and at follow-up at 1-week, 1-month, and 3-months. Diagnostic status will be evaluated at baseline and at 1-week follow-up. Exercise knowledge, exercise self-efficacy, exercise motivation, and physical activity, will be measured at baseline, 1-week-, 1-month-, and 3-month follow-ups. Multilevel modelling will compare exercise frequency and anxiety symptoms, across groups, at each time point. This RCT will be the first to evaluate whether the Unified Protocol can support people with ARDs to increase their exercise engagement. If the Unified Protocol does increase engagement, the Unified Protocol could be used by researchers and clinicians alike to support individuals with ARDs interested in using exercise to manage their anxiety, but who are experiencing difficulty maintaining an exercise regime.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT02089984,"The need for evidence-based mental health treatments i.e., 'treatment based on the best available science or research evidence', has been stressed from scientific, ethical, and economic perspectives. While empirical evidence supports both the efficacy and effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders, the demand for clinicians trained in these approaches far exceeds the supply. A major reason for this is the lack of trained cognitive behavior therapists. New technologies provide the opportunity to both facilitate accessibility to this specialized training by mental health professionals and to improve the quality of this training. Recent research has found that training clinicians using these new web-based technologies is highly effective, can significantly improve skills, and has significant advantages over traditional training programs. The long term goal of this project is to increase the number of available mental health professionals trained in cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety disorders by developing a set of web-based training tools enabling the widespread dissemination of this training. In Phase I the investigators developed a prototype online tutorial covering some core CBT principles and a Social Anxiety Disorder module. The investigators also tested the feasibility of live remote training through videoconferencing. In phase II investigators will expand the tutorial to include a comprehensive review of CBT principles and techniques and expand modules to include the full spectrum of anxiety and anxiety-related disorders (i.e., Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder). Investigators will also evaluate the efficacy of live remote training in improving clinical skills. A cohort of 50 clinicians from diverse educational and professional backgrounds will be recruited. Improvement in trainees' conceptual knowledge will be evaluated pre and post tutorial, and improvement in trainees' clinical skills in applying the CBT concepts will be evaluated by blind ratings of clinical adherence and competence at three time points: before on-line training, and before and after videoconference training. User satisfaction with both the on-line tutorial and the videoconference training will also be evaluated.

NCT03324906,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about 1 in 20,000 births, regardless of sex or race. PWS is characterized by two clinical phases. In the first, the cardinal symptoms are: neonatal hypotonia, feeding difficulty, lethargy, weak crying and hyporeflexia. The second, from six months, presents gradual improvement of hypotonia, weight gain and progressive development of hyperphagia and obesity. A recent trend is the use of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), a very simple, safe and inexpensive technique of cerebral stimulation, noninvasive and painless. It is based on the application of low intensity direct current (0-2 mA) through electrodes. tDCS has been shown to be a safe, easily tolerable method, allowing its therapeutic use in several clinical situations involving sustained cortical dysfunction such as in neurological or psychiatric disorders, including Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease and major depression. These and other studies have been shown to be consistent with tDC's therapeutic methodology, thus favoring more accurate conclusions about the efficacy and efficiency of the method. The general objective of this research is to evaluate the effects of tDCS on the treatment Obsessive Compulsive Behavior and depressive symptoms in PWS; evaluate and compare the participants' cerebral activation pattern through electroencephalographic mapping with resting-quantitative EEG (qEEG), before and after the intervention; check if the changes (if any) last 3 months after the end of the intervention (follow up). 40 individuals will be invited to participate in this study, divided into 2 groups: 20 patients with PWS, in the age group between 11 and 35 years of age diagnosed and 20 obese individuals without the diagnosis of PWS.

NCT02345668,"Emotional disorders (ED) (anxiety and mood disorders) are among the most prevalent mental disorders, with a life prevalence of 29% and comorbidity rates that range between 40 and 80%. If they are not adequately treated the course is often chronic, and them significantly affect important functioning areas such as work and social relationships. Thus, these data strongly suggest efficacious and efficient treatments are needed in order to address this important health problem. The classification and differentiation of mental disorders carried out in manuals like the DSM and the ICD has played an important role in the emphasis placed on the research about the treatment of specific disorders; however, it has also been a problem in the dissemination of evidenced-based treatments due to the difficulties in training the clinicians in the variety of the available disorder-specific programs. In fact, less than 50% of people suffering from emotional disorders receive a psychological treatment; and this is also accounted for by its costs and time of application. As a consequence, many people decide not to search for psychological treatment. In addition, epidemiological studies have shown that at least 55% of people suffering from an anxiety disorder suffer from another anxiety disorder at the moment of the assessment, and this prevalence rate is up to 76% when different lifespan diagnoses are taken into account. This high comorbidity rate indicates that the different ED share important characteristics and it has been proposed that this overlapping is accounted for by common biological and psychological vulnerabilities that along with psychosocial stress factors leads to different manifestations of the same vulnerability, i. e., the different mood and anxiety disorders. Thus, a Transdiagnostic approach could help overcome these barriers.||Transdiagnostic approaches have implications in the treatment of psychological disorders as a number of treatment protocols have been developed based on this perspective. Clark has distinguished three perspectives in transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy: a) The transdiagnostic practice, a pragmatic perspective that includes components of various disorder-specific intervention protocols whose aim is to determine which are the active components in samples with those disorders. The contributions of Norton, Andrews and Titov, and the study: Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) belong to this category. b) The transdiagnostic theory, that specifies a theoretical framework which outlines the common psychological constructs that influence the maintenance of ED. For instance, the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, with positive and negative affect as relevant constructs. c) The Unified Protocol. The Barlow's team has designed a protocol, adequate for the treatment of ED which focuses on four essential aspects: to increase present-focused emotional awareness, to identify and modify emotional avoidance patterns, to promote the cognitive flexibility and to facilitate exposure to avoided situations and sensations.||Another aspect that could enhance the dissemination of evidence-based treatments as well as considerably reduce the costs is the use of the Internet. A number of sistematic reviews has shown that Internet-based treatments yield similar results when compared to face-to-face therapy. Nevertheless, most of these programs are focused on a single disorder since a few Transdiagostic Internet-based treatments have been developed and tested by means of randomized controlled trials so far. Furthermore, no studies on efficacy of Internet-based Transdiagnostic vs Treatment as usual (TAU) have been carried out in specialized care. Therefore, we have developed a Transdiagnostic Internet-based protocol treatment (Emotion Regulation Protocol) based on the Unified Protocol proposed by Barlow, that also includes components of emotion regulation and acceptance.||The aim of this study will be to test the efficacy of a Transdiagnostic Internet-based protocol (Emotion Regulation Protocol) for the treatment of emotional disorders by means of a randomized controlled trial in a sample made up of participants from specialized care of the Spanish public mental health system. The study will include two conditions: a) Transdiagnostic Internet-based treatment protocol and b) TAU. The main hypothesis is that the Transdiagnostic protocol will be more efficacious than TAU and that will obtain a good acceptance by patients and mental health professionals. We also expect the online Transdiagnostic protocol to be more efficient when compared with TAU (e. g., a significant greater number of patients which receive a psychological treatment, a significant reduction of the waiting lists and costs such as hours of clinical assistance and hours of face-to-face treatment, etc.).",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT01339858,"Schizophrenia is a severe, debilitating illness that typically begins during the teen-age years and early twenties, and worsens over time as it evolves into a chronic, life-long disorder. Existing treatments suppress psychotic symptoms but do not prevent the evolution of underlying disease processes that results in poor, long term outcomes. Recent studies have shown that progressive erosion of cortical mass occurs during the early stages of schizophrenia (1-3). The investigators hypothesize that arresting cortical erosion during the early phases of schizophrenia will prevent subsequent clinical deterioration and the descending course of illness associated with this disorder. The investigators propose to establish a research program that will assess the ability of agents with neuroprotective properties to halt cortical loss and thereby prevent subsequent clinical deterioration.||N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is an attractive molecule for the proposed study because of two of its mechanistic properties. First, it is an established neuroprotective agent. NAC is a precursor to glutathione which is a primary detoxifier of reactive oxygen and other radical molecules which damage neuronal tissue (4-6). Glutathione deficiencies have been well documented in schizophrenia (7, 8). Second, NAC modulates glutamate release. NMDA hypofunction and altered glutamate release have been hypothesized to contribute to the cortical atrophy observed in early stage schizophrenia (9, 10). NAC has been shown to antagonize both the phencyclidine (PCP) effects of increased frontal glutamate levels and induction of social isolation in rodents (11). PCP is a pharmacological model of schizophrenia. In a controlled clinical trial of patients with chronic schizophrenia, NAC improved mismatch negativity, a pre-attentive measure of cortical information processing that has been consistently implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and has been shown to correlate with cortical erosion in early stage patients (12, 13). In a double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial of chronic schizophrenic patients, NAC significantly improved general psychopathology scores, negative symptoms and extrapyramidal symptoms (14). NAC was well tolerated with no significant effects on any safety parameter or adverse events. The favorable tolerability of NAC has been further demonstrated in a recent study conducted at IUSM Riley Hospital in children (ages 4 to 12 years) with autism at relatively high doses (dose range of 900 to 4200 mg/day) in which there were no serious adverse events reported and NAC was well tolerated (15).||The investigators propose to determine if NAC has disease modifying potential in early stage schizophrenia. The investigators hypothesize that NAC will improve measures of cortical integrity in early stage schizophrenia and these brain effects will be related to improvements in negative symptoms and cognitive functioning. Primary outcome measures in the trials will be serial assessments of cortical integrity using magnetic resonance structural (cortical thickness, cortical volume, diffuses tensor imaging, DTI). In addition the investigators will assess the possible effects of NAC treatment on other parameters linked to cortical erosion including fMRI coupled with working memory and semantic memory tasks, MR spectroscopy (cortical glutathione, N-acetylaspartate, and glutamine/glutamate levels) and electrophysiological measures (e.g., mismatch negativity, P300).

The contributions of Norton, Andrews and Titov, and the study: Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) belong to this category. b) The transdiagnostic theory, that specifies a theoretical framework which outlines the common psychological constructs that influence the maintenance of ED. For instance, the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, with positive and negative affect as relevant constructs. c) The Unified Protocol. The Barlow's team has designed a protocol, adequate for the treatment of ED which focuses on four essential aspects: to increase present-focused emotional awareness, to identify and modify emotional avoidance patterns, to promote the cognitive flexibility and to facilitate exposure to avoided situations and sensations.||Another aspect that could enhance the dissemination of evidence-based treatments as well as considerably reduce the costs is the use of the Internet. A number of systematic reviews has shown that Internet-based treatments yield similar results when compared to face-to-face therapy. Nevertheless, most of these programs are focused on a single disorder since very few transdiagostic internet-based treatments have been developed and tested by means of randomized controlled trials so far.||The main objective of the treatment components of the Unified Protocol (UP) is to train patients in the regulation of negative emotions or negative affect (NA), but less attention has been paid to the inclusion of treatment components directly targeting positive affect (PA) regulation.||Investigators of this research group (LabPsiTec) have developed a traditional transdiagnostic treatment that is partly based on the UP and it has been added a specific component of positive affect regulation in order to more directly target the regulation of positive affect. The study will include three conditions: 1) Transdiagnostic protocol (TP); 2) Transdiagnostic protocol + positive affect component (TP+PA); and 3) Waiting list control group (WL).||The main hypothesis is that both modalities of the protocol (TP and TP+PA) will result more effective than the WL condition in the primary outcome measures. Investigators expect scores on positive affect to be higher in the TP+PA condition than in the TP condition.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT02512406,"While it is widely recognized that patients with tic and Tourette Syndrome (TS) experience heightened sensitivity to or abnormal processing of internal sensations, it has also been suggested that patients with tic and TS experience abnormal processing of external sensations/stimuli. While this sensitivity to external stimuli does not appear to trigger motor or vocal tics, it can significantly affect quality of life. These sensitivities can be a source of irritation, discomfort, and distraction that can be equally or more disruptive than vocal or motor tics. Heightened sensitivity to external stimuli or other abnormalities of external sensory processing have been identified in other neuropsychological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, ADHD, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) . TS often presents with co-morbid diagnoses including attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) but it is not currently known whether sensitivity to external stimuli is due to a central processing abnormality common to these disorders.||This study's objective is to use a variety of questionnaires to determine how external stimuli along with the presence of other disorders effect sensory processing.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT01809613,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective neurosurgical approach for treating motor disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), Essential Tremor (ET), and dystonia. Its therapeutic benefit has led to the application of DBS to a wide spectrum of disorders including psychiatric conditions, epilepsy, Alzeimer's disease, headache, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette syndrome, depression and intractable pain. However, because the nature of its underlying mechanisms and clinical effects are not fully understood, precision targeting, decreasing adverse effects, and improving clinical outcomes represent major clinical and scientific challenges in PD and other disorders treated by DBS. Our goal is to investigate the inter-relationships between site-specific neural activation and clinical outcomes during DBS. To do so, we will perform non-invasive functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to investigate DBS-mediated activation of neural network circuitry. Our proposed protocol involves the addition of intraoperative fMRI to the standard DBS or battery change protocol in order to determine the major sites of activation during application of clinically effective DBS to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), ventral intermediate thalamus (VIM), globus pallidus interna (GPi), fornix, nucleus accumbens (NAc), anterior thalamus and periaqueductal gray matter. Patients will undergo clinical assessment to determine the relative efficacy of DBS stimulation parameters, applied during the fMRI and at regularly scheduled post-operative programming visits up to 6 months of follow-up. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Identify fMRI-activated brain regions by DBS in patients who undergo DBS surgery (Patients diagnosed with PD, ET, dystonia, OCD, depression, pain, Tourette's syndrome, and epilepsy. (2) Correlate fMRI activation with clinical outcomes and side effects. With the goal of improving DBS electrode targeting for optimal and reproducible clinical outcomes, these experiments will be the first attempt to relate site-specific DBS with functional in vivo imaging data and quantitative longitudinal clinical outcome measures in DBS patients.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT03734705,"Hoarding disorder is a common mental illness characterized by difficulty parting with possessions and by clutter that makes living spaces unusable. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for hoarding disorder, but new approaches are needed to engage those who are reluctant to start or cannot tolerate CBT. Both intolerance of uncertainty and emotional avoidance are linked to hoarding disorder and may interfere with treatment engagement. Imaginal exposure, a therapeutic technique which involves repeatedly imagining feared scenarios and experiencing the evoked emotions, effectively targets both intolerance of uncertainty and emotional avoidance. The present study is the first to test whether imagining discarding possessions can improve hoarding symptoms more than does a control exercise. We hypothesize that compared to a control exercise, imaginal exposure will improve hoarding symptoms, intolerance of uncertainty and emotional avoidance.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT04381897,"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a genetic condition caused by mutations in cohesin-related genes, mostly notably NIPBL. The CdLS phenotype includes physical features such as typical facies, limb abnormalities, short stature, and hirsutism as well developmental and behavioral manifestations such as intellectual disability, communication deficits, autistic traits and repetitive/self-injurious behaviors (RBs/SIB).||Behavioral challenges such as RBs/SIB pose a significant obstacle to quality of life to individuals with CdLS and families. In CdLS, disruption of developmental systems can impact neuronal and brain development, and impact GABAergic inhibitory interneuron formation, leading to RBs/SIB. Given the potential for dysregulated excitatory glutamatergic output in CdLS, neuronal oxidative stress may play a role in these maladaptive behaviors. NAC replenishes Central Nervous System (CNS) glutathione, a potent antioxidant and may ameliorate RBs/SIB. NAC has been shown to decrease maladaptive behaviors in autism and grooming disorders such as excoriation disorder (skin picking).||An 18-week cross-over trial is proposed to decrease RBs/SIB comprising two 8-week double-blinded active or placebo treatment with a 2-week wash out period in between. A cross-over design will afford for higher efficiency in sample size for similar power. Dosage will be titrated weekly starting at 600 mg daily and then increased by 600 mg every week to a target dose of 1800 mg per day. Participants will be recruited through CdLS Foundation.||Based on a mechanism for regulation glutamate transmission homeostasis in the central nervous system, the use of NAC may be particularly pertinent to individuals with CdLS. It is known that in CdLS genetic networks that impact on limb formation overlap significantly with developmental systems that impact neuronal and brain development, in particular GABAergic inhibitory interneuron formation. Given a dysregulated excitatory glutamatergic mechanism due to interneuron deficits, which can then lead to neuronal oxidative stress and programmed cell death, NAC may act as a key homeostatic regulator to prevent glutamate overactivity and neuronal damage in CdLS.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT02083926,"Roughly one-third to one-half of patients with generalized SAD do not experience significant clinical benefit from current evidence-based treatment for SAD such as pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or venlafaxine and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Failure of anxiety relief in patients with SAD is a source of substantial morbidity, distress, and decreases in quality of life. Novel pharmacological treatments are needed to improve patient outcomes with SAD.||Converging lines of evidence from neuroimaging and pharmacological studies support the importance of glutamate abnormalities in the pathogenesis of SAD. In a Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) study, an elevated glutamate to creatinine ratio was found in the anterior cingulate cortex of SAD patients when compared to healthy controls. Elevated thalamic glutamine levels have been demonstrated in patients with SAD. Pre-clinical rodent studies have also established a strong link between glutamate regulation and anxiety.||Ketamine is a potent antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a major type of glutamate receptor in the brain. Ketamine is routinely used for anesthetic induction because of its dissociative properties. However in research studies, ketamine is effective treatment in reducing symptoms in depressive and possibly anxiety disorders. In multiple controlled clinical studies, ketamine has produced a rapid antidepressant effect in unipolar and bipolar depression. Ketamine's anti-depressant effects peak 1-3 days following infusion. Ketamine's antidepressant effect is observed long after ketamine has been metabolized and excreted by the body and after ketamine's sedative and dissociative effects have dissipated.||The results of several clinical studies suggest that ketamine may also have significant anxiolytic effects. Patients with major depressive disorder given a single ketamine infusion have shown strong and significant reductions in comorbid anxiety symptoms. A trial including 11 depressed patients demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)) following ketamine infusion. This improvement is supported by one of the earlier placebo-controlled trials of ketamine which demonstrated that the psychic anxiety item was one of 4 (out of 21) items on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) demonstrating significant improvement after ketamine infusion.||The investigators goal is to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study to explore the efficacy and time course of action of intravenous ketamine in the treatment of SAD.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00001768,"Recent developments in the study of early-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette's syndrome have implicated an autoimmune etiology in a subset of these conditions, and renewed interest into the possibility of autoimmune pathophysiology underlying other psychiatric disorders. There are several clinical and epidemiologic similarities between autoimmune diseases and schizophrenia: genetic predisposition, but with twin concordance below 50%; waxing and waning course; exacerbation of symptoms or precipitation of relapse by psychosocial stress. However, other mixed evidence has engendered considerable debate in the literature regarding the role of immune mechanisms in schizophrenia. The clinical efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in immune-mediated neurological diseases has been documented, and clinical studies of the efficacy of IVIg in the treatment of both Tourette's syndrome and OCD are currently ongoing at the NIMH (see protocol 92-M-0132). In this protocol, we propose a 13-week placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study of IVIg in 25 patients suffering from treatment-refractory childhood-onset schizophrenia. After the first 5 patients have completed the trial, this data will be presented to the NIMH Institutional Review Board and a decision will be made as to whether this trial should proceed.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00001246,"Objective: Our work is driven by the core hypotheses that many of the most severe neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood onset are associated with deviations from thepath of normal brain development, the neuroanatomical substrates of which can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Consequently, the long-term goals of the protocol are to: (1) map neuroanatomic and neurophysiological trajectories of brain development in health and illness; and (2) discern influences on those trajectories from demographic (e.g. age and sex), cognitive/behavioral (e.g. IQ), and clinical (e.g. presence/absence of a known neurogenetic disorders) factors. Data from the project have resulted in seminal papers on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Childhood-Onset Schizophrenia, and typical pediatric brain development. The biological bases of male / female differences are explored via studies of subjects with anomalous sex chromosome numbers (e.g. XO, XXX, XYY, XXYY, XXXXY).||Study population: Our studies include data from typically developing youth, and individuals with a range of psychiatric presentations from behaviorally-defined (e.g. Childhood-Onset Schizophrenia, Autism Spectrum Disorder) as well as geneticallydefined (e.g. Sex Chromosome Aneuploidy) groups. Participants span a wide age range (from 3 years of age upwards).||Design: The study design is to have participants come to the NIH for brain imaging, psychological/psychiatric testing, and genetic characterization. Assessment visits each take approximately 2 days to complete. Participants are invited to return for longitudinal assessments (at approximately 2-year intervals).||Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measure used to date have derived from T1-weighted structural neuroimaging data which enable us to characterize how a range of anatomical brain phenotypes vary as a function of age, sex, behavioral/cognitive traits, diagnostic status and genotype.

NCT04142320,"Nearly 50% of all Americans will suffer from a mental health disorder during their lifetimes. Brain stimulation treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), are increasingly used to normalize dysfunctional brain circuits in these disorders. Mechanistically, rTMS is thought to work by changing the synaptic strength of neurons, referred to as brain plasticity. Despite the variety of disorders targeted and significant between-patient heterogeneity, rTMS is currently applied in a manner that is one-size-fits-all (without any individual optimization of the stimulation pattern) and open-loop (fixed schedule of stimulation pattern, with no measurement or adjustment during rTMS). I believe that the response rate of rTMS for depression, which is at present <50%, can be improved through personalized brain stimulation that enhances target engagement and maximizes plasticity. To personalize brain stimulation, one must (1) measure and monitor brain changes in real-time; (2) determine the optimal stimulation patterns for inducing brain changes; (3) develop adaptive treatments to drive desired changes on an individual patient-specific level over time. Such personalization of brain stimulation will increase our mechanistic understanding of brain plasticity to improve efficacy in non-responders to standard treatments.||The primary goals of my research program are to (1) discover brain biomarkers that predict progression to clinical remission, and (2) develop closed-loop treatment algorithms that optimize these biomarkers and improve clinical outcomes. I will focus on depression as it is the leading cause of disability worldwide and and medications are ineffective or not tolerated for close to half of these patients. Leveraging my previous work, I propose three stages of development of personalized brain stimulation using single pulses of TMS combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to generate a causal measurement of brain state that can easily be translated to the clinic. The TMS-EEG depression severity biomarker that I recently discovered occurs 30 milliseconds after administering a TMS test pulse (p30) in the fronto-parietal network (FPN), a region implicated in depression. The degree of suppression of this p30 signal predicted clinical outcome in depressed patients following rTMS treatment. Additionally, a single stimulation session was sufficient to suppress the p30 during and for 30 minutes after stimulation. This work indicates that p30 suppression can be monitored in real-time and has the potential to support empiric treatment optimization.||Specific aims are as follows:||Aim 1: To create a platform for monitoring p30 changes (depression severity biomarker) in real-time. Through this aim, I will develop tools to monitor biomarkers in real-time, a necessary step for closed-loop interventions.||Aim 2: To identify the stimulation parameters that causally and maximally suppress the p30. Through this aim, I will establish the causal relationship between stimulation and biomarker change.||Aim 3: To test whether closed-loop rTMS more strongly suppresses the p30 compared to standard rTMS. This aim will yield a closed-loop treatment based on empiric biomarkers that will more effectively modulate an individual's brain circuitry.||This project tests the hypothesis that individualizing and continuously updating rTMS treatment guided by the depression severity biomarker will maximally induce specific brain changes. Specifically, I will develop real-time brain monitoring and test whether optimizing rTMS by maximally suppressing the p30 can more effectively modulate the fronto-parietal network.||I plan to recruit 54 medication-naive depressed patients and for all patients perform a three-phase, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to 1) identify how standard and optimized rTMS patterns engage the depression severity biomarker, and 2) determine the dose-response of these rTMS patterns.||Single pulse TMS-evoked potential (TEP), a well-studied causal EEG measure of brain excitability, will be measured before, during, and after rTMS. Primary outcome in this study will be target engagement of the strength of suppression of the fronto-parietal p30 (30ms positive voltage change after a TMS test pulse). This signal is chosen because the strength of suppression has been shown to predict improvement in clinical symptoms after rTMS.||Participants will first complete a screening procedure to determine eligibility based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the participants are not eligible, no further study procedures will be conducted. Eligible participants will then complete three phases of this cross-over pilot study. All conditions will target the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex using neuronavigated rTMS as this is the standard of care treatment site for rTMS. Future work will use similar methods to determine the optimal stimulation site, but this study focuses on identifying the optimal stimulation pattern, as this is the most commonly clinically-adjusted parameter and one that has been shown from animal models to have a direct impact on brain plasticity. The three phases of the study are below and detailed in the Research Strategy:||Phase 1: Determine for each patient which standard open-loop rTMS protocol maximally suppresses the p30 in the fronto-parietal network (target engagement of the depression severity biomarker). Participants will complete one session each of clinically-utilized (1, 5, 10, 20Hz) rTMS and sham rTMS (Fig 8A in Research Strategy). rTMS sessions will be applied in a cross-over, pseudorandomized fashion and separated by 1 week to prevent buildup of brain changes. Target engagement will be measured using the strength of p30 suppression in the fronto-parietal network both during and after rTMS. For each condition, rTMS will be applied for two consecutive days to determine the dose response.||Phase 2: Determine for each patient the optimal open-loop rTMS to maximally suppress the p30. Starting with the standard rTMS pattern that maximally suppresses the p30, participants will receive one session of stimulation while varying power, duration, and frequency in an event-related design (Fig 8B). From the p30 response of each stimulation pattern, an optimal and individualized open-loop rTMS pattern will be generated using machine learning approaches.||Phase 3: Determine if closed-loop rTMS more strongly suppresses the p30 compared to optimized or standard open-loop rTMS. The goal of the third phase is to determine if there is added benefit to closed-loop stimulation (adjustment of stimulation parameters during stimulation) over optimizing open-loop rTMS (Phase 2). In a pseudorandomzied fashion, 3 different conditions of rTMS will be administered over 3 weeks. 2 consecutive doses of each condition will be performed to determine dose response. Each condition will be separated by 1 week. Target engagement will be assessed with the strength of p30 suppression in the frontoparietal network. rTMS conditions are as follows:||Open-loop standard rTMS. For each patient, the standard rTMS protocol that maximally suppressed the p30 in Aim 2.1 will be administered.|Open-loop optimized rTMS. For each patient, the optimal rTMS pattern derived from Phase 2 (Aim 2.2) of this study will be applied in open-loop fashion.|Closed-loop rTMS. For each patient, rTMS will be administered starting with the optimal open-loop solution and updated in real-time using control systems theory. Here, feature inputs (brain state, stimulation frequency, duration, and power) and outputs (p30 suppression) will be continuously compared and feature weights in the model updated to maximally suppress the p30.||Findings from this study will provide the basis for a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of closed-loop rTMS against standard rTMS.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00033995,"The purpose of this study is to determine the areas of the brain responsible for tics in patients with Tourette's syndrome and chronic motor tic disorder using [15O]H2O. Previous neuroimaging studies have looked at brain activity during tics using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), but a major drawback of these studies lay in the difficulty distinguishing between the activity in the brain responsible for tic generation versus activity in motor-related structures due to tic movements. We plan to overcome this difficulty in our paradigm using two rest conditions without any movement. One is a state when patients suppress their tics and the second is sleep state, when tics usually cease or are at least very infrequent. 23 adult patients with a DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 2000) diagnosis of a tic disorder and frequent tics will be studied. These two rest states will be compared with a condition where tics are allowed to occur spontaneously.

NCT04631042,"Study Description:||Many neuropsychiatric disorders have extreme impairing impulsivity and compulsivity behaviors at their core. We hypothesized that the development of symptoms of impulsivity and compulsivity during childhood/adolescence and early adulthood will be associated with atypical trajectories of brain features including cortical glutamate (the main excitatory neurotransmitter) and functional/structural brain connectivity. Additionally, we hypothesize that cortical glutamate will be under genetic control (i.e., heritable) and that common genetic variant risk for disorders characterized by extreme impulsivity (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and by extreme compulsivity (e.g., obsessive compulsive disorder) will also be associated with atypical cortical glutamate trajectories. To elucidate the relationships between the developing brain, compulsivity/impulsivity and genomics, we will collect clinical assessments including clinician-led interviews, neurobehavioral assessments, neuroimaging data, and genomic samples using 1) a prospective longitudinal design to answer developmental hypotheses; 2) an extended multigenerational family design to assess genomic hypotheses.||Objectives:||Primary Objectives:||A) To assess the effects of impulsivity and compulsivity on the developmental trajectories of cortical glutamate.||B) To determine the heritability of cortical glutamate.||Secondary Objectives:||A) To establish the reliability of glutamate measurements.||B) To examine the impact of atypical glutamate levels on developing structural and functional connections within the fronto-striatal circuits.||Endpoints:||Primary Endpoint:||A) Age-related change in cortical glutamate levels and its moderation by individual differences in levels of impulsivity and compulsivity.||B) Heritability of cortical glutamate (proportion of variance explained by additive genetic factors).||Secondary Endpoints:||A) 1. Glutamate levels estimated at 3 Tesla at short intervals to establish test-retest reliability.||2. Glutamate levels estimated at both 3 Tesla and 7 Tesla (cross scanner validation).||B) Measures of the brain s structural and functional connectivity.||Study Population:||We aim to recruit 1100 participants over the next 7 years.

NCT04449003,"Tourette syndrome (TS) is a multi-faceted neurodevelopmental disorder with wide-ranging impact on adolescent quality of life (QOL). Comorbid psychiatric and psychological factors exert greater influence on QOL than tics in TS, but the specific role of stress, family dynamics, and peer relationships has been largely overlooked, despite the fact that these factors are known to impact QOL in those with chronic disease.

NCT00571103,"Because the opiate antagonists appear to be effective in the treatment of pathological gambling (PG), it is reasonable to ask whether acamprosate (calcium acetylhomotaurine; Campral), also FDA approved for the treatment of alcoholism, can be used effectively to treat PG. Acamprosate is not an opioid antagonist; rather, it is assumed that its therapeutic effects are due to actions on GABA receptors. Acamprosate is structurally related to 1-glutamic, which is an excitatory neurotransmitter. It has been proposed that acamprosate decreases the effects of the naturally-occuring excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the body. Because chronic alcohol consumption disrupts this system, and the changes last many months after alcohol ingestion is stopped, it is possible that acamprosate restores the glutamate system towards normal. Regardless, acamprosate decreases the pleasant ""high"" associated with alcohol consumption, and thus decreases the frequency of relapse during abstinence. We hypothesize that acamprosate will have similar actions in persons with PG.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT04035057,"Following decades of psychosocial treatment research the field has established numerous evidence-based practices (EBPs) for mental disorders, but has struggled to widely disseminate these practices in community settings. Exposure therapy for anxiety disorders represents one of the most glaring examples of this research to practice gap. A well-known barrier to the dissemination and quality delivery of exposure therapy is therapists' negative beliefs about its potential danger or intolerability for patients. These beliefs are common even among therapists who report receiving specialized training; thus, research is needed to develop targeted training strategies for reducing negative beliefs and improving delivery quality. Preliminary research suggests specific behavioral strategies (i.e., self-exposure) may reduce negative beliefs above and beyond standard didactic trainings (Farrell, Kemp et al., 2016). Building upon these findings, the investigators propose a novel experimental therapeutics approach to developing and testing a targeted behavioral training for augmenting negative beliefs in a sample of community mental health professionals. The first phase of the study is a case-series analysis for establishing target engagement (i.e., belief reduction) and determining adequate dosing of the behavioral strategies. Phase two is a randomized trial of the behaviorally-enhanced training strategies (BeTS) against a standard didactic protocol. Therapist will complete a day-long workshop followed by weekly consultation while delivering exposure for children with anxiety disorders. In-session delivery behavior will be recorded and examined using a validated micro-analytic coding system. It is hypothesized that therapists in the BeTS condition will evidence significantly lower negative beliefs about exposure relative to the didactic condition, at 1) post-workshop, and 2) end of study. IT is also hypothesized that the degree of negative belief reduction following the initial workshop training will be associated with 1) higher rates of optimal in-session delivery behaviors, and 2) lower rates of suboptimal delivery behaviors as measured by both self-report and observational coding data. This study will establish an innovative model for developing a targeted training intervention capable of increasing the dissemination and quality of exposure therapy and other EBPs.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT03649347,"Anxiety and stress-related disorders are very common. One in three people experience some form of anxiety disorder including phobias, PTSD, and OCD. These disorders chronically limit one's ability to function and enjoy life. In addition to the common prevalence, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have left about 13% of the returning veterans with combat PTSD, and even more with partial symptoms. Lifetime prevalence of PTSD is as high as 10% in women. Economic burden of anxiety disorders is between 42 to 52 billion dollars, one third of the country's total mental health bill. Near 30% of this money is spent in treatment costs. Burden of lost workdays only for PTSD is $3 billion.||Exposure therapy is the most effective treatment for cue-related anxiety disorders such as specific phobias, social phobia, OCD, and PTSD. The core principle is exposure to the feared objects/situations guided by a clinician. For example, in arachnophobia (fear of spiders) patient is exposed to picture of a spider on a computer, or from distance in the office, and gradually, with help of the clinician, they tolerate view of the spider from a closer distance. Clinician has a crucial role as the social safety cue in this process.||Although exposure therapy is very effective in treatment of phobias, OCD, and PTSD, there are limitations. Access and adherence to, and efficacy of exposure therapy are limited to 50% by multiple factors: First, there is a national shortage of psychiatrists and psychotherapists; patients often have to be on waiting list for weeks to months, and in many geographical locations such services are extremely scarce or do not exist. More than 50% of clinicians are not trained in exposure therapy, and there is usually geographical barriers for access to skilled therapists. In general, more than half of the US counties are unable to recruit mental health providers. Very frequently patients only receive medication or supportive therapy for several years before they can see a specialist trained in exposure therapy. Certain conditions like social phobia or PTSD make it increasingly difficult to leave the house and go to the clinic. Second, the feared objects are not always available in office for exposure and exposure most of the times is limited to pictures, movie clips, imagination, narrative, or memories. Imaginary exposure commonly lacks the level of arousal that is required for development of new safety learning. Third, patients have to practice real-life exposure on their own. In vivo treatment is commonly limited: often patients do not create situations that elicit the optimal safety learning, do not know how to create exposure situations, or simply do not follow through because of high anxiety in the absence of someone to coach them. This gap between exposure in the office, and real-life exposure remains a significant roadblock in successful exposure therapy. Fourth, clinicians are usually unable to provide treatment across multiple physical, temporal and social contexts that can promote contextualization of safety learning. Exposure mostly happens in the physical, emotional, social, and temporal context of the office visits. A fifth limitation is that current exposure therapy methods, do not address overgeneralization of the fear response.||Augmented Reality Augmented reality (AR) is the next wave of interactive human-computer technology that provides an opportunity of mixing virtually created objects with reality. Instead of creating a completely synthetic environment, AR adds virtually created objects to the real non-synthetic context. These elements become part of the real context, or cover some of its components. AR technology ultimately becomes less expensive than virtual reality (VR) technology because it does not require modeling the whole environment.||The investigators have developed a proof of concept prototype. The prototype that includes a scenario for treatment of fear of spiders (arachnophobia), and fear of snakes. Software platform connects the patient to a clinician who is located in the same or a different physical space, the patient wears the AR device, the clinician is able to see the patient's field of view, and positions a virtual spider/snake on a surface in the patient's environment, clinician determines direction/velocity of motions of the virtual spider/snake, clinician leads patient through the process of exposure therapy process until patient is desensitized to the view of the spider/snake. Exposure can then advance to higher number of spiders/snakes, or larger ones.||Subject Recruitment: Subject recruitment will happen at the Wayne State University (WSU) Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences (DPBN) psychiatry clinic, through flyers spread on the campus, and advertisement on Wayne State's student website.

NCT03102008,"The goal of this study is to examine how a core dysfunction transdiagnostic psychotherapy for emotional disorders in youth influences change in cross-cutting features both theoretically linked to neuroticism and also targeted by this treatment. Another goal is to investigate change in symptoms of emotional disorders, including anxiety and depression, throughout the course of this treatment, the Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescents (UP-A).||My long-term goal is to identify ways to personalize an effective psychotherapy model for an array of youth emotional disorders by determining how and when implementation of different components of the UP-A influence change in mental health. My research objective in this study is to use group-level and novel single case analytic strategies to identify changes in emotional disorders during the implementation of the UP-A, a transdiagnostic form of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for adolescents. Specifically, I am interested in examining how features of the core dysfunction targeted by the UP-A, high neuroticism as well as symptoms of emotional disorders change throughout UP-A treatment. My central hypothesis is that adolescents with emotional disorders will display changes in measures of core dysfunction and reductions in symptoms of emotional disorders throughout UP-A treatment.||Aim 1: Investigate relationships between the use of UP-A treatment components and changes in measures of neuroticism, a core dysfunction that cuts across of emotional disorders. The main working hypothesis is that the administration of the UP-A will result in observable changes in measures of cross-cutting features of emotional disorders linked to neuroticism (cognitive flexibility, distress tolerance, and experiential avoidance). Such changes will occur after the introduction of relevant core principles of the UP-A. The proposed study is designed to determine whether change in these aspects of neuroticism and emotional disorder symptoms occur directly following the presentation of treatment components, or whether changes might instead be staggered throughout treatment.||Aim 2: Investigate when and how reductions in symptoms of emotional disorders (i.e., symptoms of anxiety and depression, severity of presenting problems) occur throughout treatment. Based on knowledge obtained from previous randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on the treatment of anxiety, depressive and related disorders, the main working hypothesis of Aim 2 is that the severity of emotional disorder symptoms will decrease from pre- to post-treatment.||Exploratory Aim 3: Investigate aspects of neuroticism as potential mechanisms of change in emotional disorder symptoms. The primary working hypothesis of Aim 3 is that changes in features of neuroticism targeted by the UP-A will precede changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms.||RESEARCH STRATEGY A. SIGNIFICANCE Anxiety, depression, and related emotional disorders are prevalent and impairing. They have high levels of symptom overlap and also share underlying temperament factors, including high neuroticism and low extroversion. The UP-A and similar core dysfunction-focused transdiagnostic therapy approaches may lead to successful treatment by targeting features that cut across emotional disorders.||B. INNOVATION Several studies of the UP-A indicate significant improvements in both anxiety and depression from pre- to post-treatment. Research foci have recently shifted in an effort to figure out why such these core-dysfunction treatments work. One step in this direction is determining whether cross-cutting features defining internalizing disorders (i.e., neuroticism and related constructs) might serve as mechanisms of treatment-based change in disorder symptoms and severity. One case study using the adult UP treatment found that changes in cross-cutting features, including mindfulness and cognitive reappraisal, changed prior to reductions in anxiety and depression. Within the child literature, a downward adaptation of the UP-A (as compared to anxiety-focused CBT program) demonstrated greater decreases in several cross-cutting features of emotional disorders, including sadness dysregulation and reappraisal, over the course of treatment. However, no study thus far has investigated change processes in cross-cutting features of emotional disorders, during treatment with the UP-A. The present study will advance our understanding of how implementation of the UP-A might lead to change in direct cognitive and behavioral targets as well as symptoms of emotional disorders in adolescents. An increased understanding of how, when and for whom the UP-A works is vital to personalizing this psychotherapy and maximizing its efficiency and uptake in future dissemination and implementation research. Another innovation of this investigation is its novel application of single-case research design methodology and modeling techniques in the analysis of time-sequence data. Although mechanisms of change may be investigated via large-scale RCTs of clinical interventions, the time, cost and labor of such trials can impede rapid dissemination efforts. This innovative single-case methodology allows clinical researchers to vet potential mechanisms of change more quickly to be used in future research.||C. APPROACH Research Design and Methods Overview. A non-concurrent multiple baseline design will be used. This type of design includes a series of A-B replications along with randomly assigned baseline periods (2, 3, or 4 weeks in this study; 3 participants per baseline condition). Repeated measures (adolescent- and parent-report of changes in cross-cutting features of emotional disorders and of disorder-specific symptoms) will be given weekly throughout treatment with more comprehensive assessment (adolescent- and parent-report as well as clinician-rated clinical severity and diagnostic impressions) occurring at pre- and post-treatment time points. The specific combination of analyses being used (nonparametric group-level comparisons to assess change at major time points [pre-, mid-, and post-treatment] as well as Simulation Modeling Analysis [SMA] to assess change over time in an individual) requires measures to be administered at a variety of time points (i.e., pre- and post- treatment, pre-, mid-, and post-treatment; weekly, respectively). Thus, change over time in weekly measures will be examined at pre-, mid-, and post-treatment at a group level, while change over time in weekly measures will be examined using weekly data (baseline, treatment repeated measures) at an individual subject level. Further, change over time in clinical interview data will be assessed from pre- to post-treatment.||Participants. A minimum of nine clinically anxious and/or depressed adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 will be recruited via a university clinic, with at least three adolescents randomized to each baseline condition.||Intervention.

NCT02028247,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are common neurodevelopmental syndromes affecting 1% of U.S. children. Comorbid anxiety disorders affect 40 to 50% of children with ASD, causing substantial distress and impairment over and above that caused by ASD alone. Although standard practice cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been established as an efficacious and safe treatment for anxiety disorders among typically developing youth, its utility in comorbid cases with ASD remains unknown. To date, no studies have experimentally compared standard practice CBT to a cognitive-behavioral intervention that has been personalized for children with a comorbid presentation of anxiety and ASD. Accordingly, we are proposing a randomized controlled trial to be conducted at three treatment sites to evaluate the efficacy of personalized CBT for anxiety in ASD (Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism: BIACA) relative to standard practice CBT for anxiety (Coping Cat program). Furthermore, this study will employ a waitlist control group to assess the efficacy of each CBT arm relative to the absence of treatment (i.e., a Waitlist control arm). The proposed research will: (1) examine the efficacy of BIACA relative to Coping Cat, which represents standard practice treatment, and the efficacy of both these treatments relative to a waitlist control group, (2) evaluate the maintenance of treatment gains, (3) examine the impact of personalized intervention on functional outcomes. A total of 201youth across 3 study locations (ages 8-13 years) with ASD and co-occurring anxiety will be randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The three recruitment sites for this study are University of California, Los Angeles, the University of South Florida (USF), and Temple University.

NCT03507218,"This multi-site study is intended to collect data and samples from a nationwide cohort of children with Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS). PANS is defined by three clinical criteria:||Abrupt, dramatic onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or severely restricted||food intake AND||Concurrent presence of additional neuropsychiatric symptoms, with similarly severe and acute onset, from at least two of the following seven categories:||Anxiety (particularly separation anxiety)|Emotional lability and depression|Irritability, aggression, and/or severely oppositional behaviors|Behavioral (developmental) regression|Deterioration in school performance (due to inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, or others)|Sensory or motor abnormalities|Somatic signs and symptoms, including sleep disturbances, enuresis, or urinary frequency|Symptoms are not better explained by a known neurologic or medical disorder, such as Sydenham chorea, systemic lupus erythematosus, Tourette disorder, or others.||As a clinical syndrome, PANS likely represents a number of different disorders with unique symptom constellations, disease mechanisms, and etiologies. The purpose of this investigation is to identify these distinctive disorders by carefully documenting, archiving, and analyzing the clinical features of each case of PANS, including not only details of the onset and course of symptoms, but also results of physical examination, laboratory assays, and paraclinical assessments, such as electroencephalography (EEG), polysomnography (PSG), brain imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scans), and others. In addition to defining the unique clinical features associated with a specific disorder, we also hope to identify biomarkers of risk and disease severity, including not only determinant genes, but also environmental triggers, such as those producing post-infectious autoimmunity (e.g., Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infection, or PANDAS). To accomplish this, we propose to collect and archive clinical information and biospecimens at different stages of the illness (e.g., initial onset, first exacerbation, following known environmental triggers, during convalescence, etc.) and also to compare these results against data and specimens obtained from healthy controls and children with non-PANDAS OCD, tics, anxiety disorders, or eating disorder. Clinical, laboratory, and biomedical data will be stored in the NIMH database (housed on the Clinical Trials Database [CTDB] of NICHD) and blood, genetic material, and other biospecimens, including microbial cultures, stored in the NIMH Genetics/Biological Repository. There are two types of baseline evaluations within this protocol. The first is limited to participants with acute-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms (PANS subjects) and will be conducted in the NIH Clinical Center by investigators from the NIMH Section on Behavioral Pediatrics (Drs. Swedo, Grant, and Hommer.) These in-depth phenotyping evaluations will include medical and psychiatric history, family history, completion of standardized questionnaires, physical and neurological examinations, neuropsychological testing, MRI scan, throat swab (for microbiologic testing), cheek swab (to obtain genetic samples), and phlebotomy to obtain blood for laboratory assays and genetic testing. Children with undiagnosed acute-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms may undergo additional testing as part of the diagnostic evaluation; these assessments might include (among others), electroencephalography (EEG), echocardiogram/electrocardiogram (ECHO/ECG) and/or polysomnography (PSG). If the child s clinical presentation warrants a lumbar puncture as part of the diagnostic evaluation, (e.g. abnormal findings on neurologic exam, EEG or PSG, or lab abnormalities suggestive of systemic autoimmunity or neuroinflammation), a sample of cerebrospinal fluid will be collected for research, as well as for clinical testing. Sedation will not be used for these lumbar punctures, nor will it be used for any research purposes in this protocol.||The second type of baseline evaluation will be used at NIMH for subjects with non-PANDAS psychiatric disorders and healthy volunteers. At participating extramural institutions, this is the evaluation that will be used for all participants (PANS, non-PANS, healthy volunteers) evaluated. These evaluations will include standardized questionnaires, medical and psychiatric history, family history, physical examination, throat swab (for microbiologic testing), cheek swab (to obtain genetic samples), and phlebotomy to obtain blood for clinical assays and research, including genetic studies. The assessments will generally be completed in an outpatient clinic at the participating site, but also might be performed on hospitalized children, if their medical condition permits research participation. Family members of PANS probands will have a medical and psychiatric history and physical exam and provide a blood sample (or cheek swab) for genetic research.||The Affected Probands, Healthy Volunteers, and Subjects with Non-PANS Psychiatric Disorders will have follow-up evaluations annually, as well as on Ad Hoc basis. The Annual check-ups will include an interim clinical history and relevant symptom ratings (tailored to the subject s clinical profile). These follow-up evaluations may be done by phone or videoconference. Ad hoc evaluations will occur during periods of health (if not healthy at baseline) and during an episode of acute illness (either infectious illness or neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations) and convalescence (at least 8 weeks after recovery). These in-person evaluations will include an interim clinical history, relevant symptom ratings, phlebotomy to obtain research bloods, and in some cases, acquisition of microbial samples (oral, nasal, nasopharyngeal and/or pharyngeal swabs, and feces). To identify biomarkers of disease and recovery, children with PANS may be followed until their 18th birthday, even if fully recovered from their acute illness. Healthy volunteers and psychiatric controls will be followed no longer than 3 years from study entry.||This is a natural history study, with the primary goal of collecting clinical data and biospecimens in order to identify subgroups of patients sharing a common disease mechanism and thus provide opportunities for development of new treatment and prevention strategies. The wealth of clinical information and the large number of biologic and genetic samples acquired in this prospective, longitudinal investigation also permits us to address four specific aims:||Identify unique and distinctive clinical, paraclinical, and laboratory features of acuteonset neuropsychiatric disorders among patients meeting criteria for PANS.|Determine the role of environmental pathogens, such as Group A streptococci, in the etiopathogenesis of acute-onset neuropsychiatric disorders.|Investigate factors influencing host susceptibility and resistance.|Elucidate the role of immune dysfunction in PANS or a subgroup of its patients.|Provide clinical diagnostic assessments to children with undiagnosed acute-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

Children who appear eligible for the study may attend a diagnostic evaluation and assessment if they meet study criteria.||If a child is eligible for the study, he or she will be randomly assigned to either get an ""active"" form of the computer program or a ""placebo"" or inactive form of the computer program. The child will come to six weekly appointments at our clinic that are quite brief, about a half hour. Then the child will have an evaluation after the last of the six appointments to see if the computer intervention was helpful in reducing his or her anxiety. We'd then wait a month and then have a final evaluation to see if the child's anxiety has changed over that period of time.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT01063348,"Pathologic skin picking involves repetitive, ritualistic, or impulsive picking of otherwise normal skin leading to tissue damage, personal distress, and impaired functioning. Although skin picking has been described in the medical literature for over one-hundred years, it remains a poorly understood psychiatric issue and often goes undiagnosed and untreated.||Picking behavior does not by itself suggest a psychiatric disorder. Pathology exists in the focus, duration and extent of the behavior, as well as the reasons for picking, associated emotions, and resulting problems. Patients with PSP report thoughts of picking or impulses to pick that are irresistible, intrusive and/or senseless. These thoughts, impulses, or behaviors also cause marked distress for patients and significantly interfere with other activities. Unlike normal picking behavior, the pathologic form of skin picking is recurrent and usually results in noticeable skin damage.||Thirty subjects with pathologic skin picking will receive 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with N-acetyl cysteine or matching placebo. The hypothesis to be tested is that N-acetyl cysteine will be more effective than placebo in patients with pathologic skin picking. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of an often disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00525226,"Depression and anxiety are serious conditions affecting millions of people each year. In fact, it is estimated that approximately one in every four women will be treated for a mood disorder, such as depression or anxiety, at some point in her life. As effective treatment options continue to develop, many women diagnosed with depression or anxiety are able to resume normal lives and may choose to become pregnant. However, studies suggest that the intrauterine environment can be altered by maternal stress, depression, and anxiety, which may affect the fetus during pregnancy. Also, antidepressant medications have been known to cause complications for both the mother and fetus, which can make pregnancy a very difficult time for women with a history of depression and anxiety. These women are more prone to relapse during pregnancy, even if they previously recovered from the disorder. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether symptoms of depression and anxiety, during or soon after pregnancy, affect an infant's social and emotional development.||Participation in this study will occur from early in the woman's pregnancy until her infant's first birthday. Participants will attend at least eight study visits during pregnancy and five study visits during the first year of the infant's life. Most study visits will take place at the Emory University clinic on campus. During the first study visit, participants will complete questionnaires regarding their current mood, stressors, supports, experiences during pregnancy, symptoms of depression or anxiety, and any treatment or medications they are currently receiving. Urine and blood will also be collected at the initial visit. Follow-up visits, lasting 1 hour, will occur monthly until delivery. During these visits, similar questionnaires will be administered and blood, urine, and saliva samples will be collected. Uterine blood flow, fetal activity, and fetal heart rate will be recorded at some follow-up visits. Women who undergo an amniocentesis will have the option of providing a sample of amniotic fluid and an additional blood sample.||Immediately after delivery, blood from the baby's umbilical cord and blood from the mother will be collected. A week after delivery, a home visit will be scheduled to assess each mother's mood, stress, supports, delivery complications, and first impressions of the new baby. At this time, a behavioral assessment will also be conducted on each infant, and mothers will be observed while interacting with their child. At the infant's 6-month pediatrician visit, a saliva sample will be taken to measure levels of cortisol and other indicators of stress. Infants will be assessed at three other times before their first birthday. During these assessments, the infant's ability to regulate his or her emotions will be evaluated by videotaped behavioral observations, stress hormones from saliva, heart rate, or recordings of brain activity through the use of either an electroencephalogram (EEG) or event related potentials (ERP). Lastly, participants will be given the option to provide a DNA sample for further analysis and future research. Fathers of the babies will be included in selected study visits. Results from this study will be used to help prevent emotional and social developmental problems in infants whose mothers have been diagnosed with either depression or anxiety.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT02476136,"Study design:||The proposed project is an individual patient data meta-analysis. The investigators will collate data from 29 randomized controlled trials of second-generation antidepressants (specifically: paroxetine, paroxetine controlled release (CR), duloxetine, and fluoxetine) for the short-term treatment of an anxiety disorder, including a total of approximately 8,800 participants. The anxiety disorders that are included in the proposed project are generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder (PD). Generalized linear mixed models will be used to investigate whether initial symptom severity is related to antidepressant efficacy.||Statistical analysis plan:||A separate longitudinal analysis will be conducted for each disorder. For GAD, SAD, OCD, and PTSD, linear mixed models will be used; for PD, a generalized linear mixed model (multilevel negative binomial regression) will be used, as the dependent variable for this disorder (number of panic attacks) is a discrete count variable. Maximum likelihood estimation will be used as the estimation method for the linear mixed models, while Laplace approximation will be used as the estimation method for the multilevel negative binomial regression for PD. In all models, measurement occasion represents level 1, participants represent level 2, and trial represents level 3. The effect measure of interest is the change in symptoms from baseline, except for PD, for which the effect measure of interest is the total number of panic attacks per two weeks.||The initial model will be built by including all the fixed effects of interest, regardless of significance. These include initial severity, treatment group and covariates (see below). Linear and quadratic terms for time (in days since baseline) will be included. For each participant, the actual visit dates will be used (if available) rather than the intended weekly visit date. The following two- and three-way interactions will also be included: severity x group, severity x linear time, group x linear time, severity x group x linear time, severity x quadratic time, group x quadratic time, severity x group x quadratic time.||Using this first model, the variance-covariance structure of the nested data will be modeled by including random effects. Random effects for study, subject and (linear and quadratic) time, as well as various covariance structures (unstructured, autocorrelated errors, Toeplitz, etc.) will be considered. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) will be used for estimation, and the best-fitting model will be selected based upon the Akaike Information Criterion (AICc).||In this best-fitting model, backward selection with maximum likelihood (ML) will be used to select the significant fixed effects. Non-significant interaction terms will be removed from the model (unless the three-way interaction of group x severity x (linear or quadratic) time is significant, in which case all two-way interactions and main effects that use these variables will be retained). The best-fitting model will again be selected based upon the Akaike Information Criterion (AICc).||Covariates: Models with and without the following covariates will be tested: age, gender, and duration of illness (if available). Only the main effect of these covariates will be included; no interactions with other variables will be included.||Missing data: Baseline variables (such as initial severity) are likely to be essentially complete, but some change scores are likely to be missing due to dropout or missed measurement occasions. The assumption is made that these data are missing at random (MAR), that is: missingness of the dependent variable may depend upon observed variables (such as previous symptom scores or covariates), but it does not depend upon the value of the unobserved (missing) variable. When MAR holds, the mixed model yields unbiased estimates of coefficients and standard errors even when some data is missing, and no other methods for handling missing data are required.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT01565629,"Many children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience substantial anxiety that can cause impairment above that of an ASD alone. Few studies have examined effective treatment options for anxiety in this population.Preliminary studies have established the efficacy of computer-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy in otherwise typically developing youth with anxiety. Accordingly, this study seeks to examine the efficacy of computer assisted CBT in children with autism and ASD. A randomized-control trial will examine the ability of computer-assisted CBT to treat anxiety in comparison to a waitlist condition. This study will recruit approximately 40 youth ages 7-12 years. Significant reductions in anxiety severity and overall improvement of functioning will establish this treatment's ability to treat anxiety. This study aims to evaluate the acute efficacy of CCBT relative to WAITLIST in children with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorders;examine the short-term durability of treatment gains for youth receiving CCBT; examine whether, relative to WAITLIST, CCBT results in improved social; adaptive; and global functioning, as well as reduced child- and parent-rated anxiety symptoms; and examine whether, relative to WAITLIST, CCBT is associated with greater satisfaction and consumer acceptability.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT01178385,"Autism spectrum disorders affect as many as 1 out of 150 children (Centers for Disease Control, 2007), with many higher-functioning children not being diagnosed until elementary school or later (Fombonne, 2003). Significant impairment in social, adaptive, and school functioning is prevalent and longstanding (Howlin et al., 2004). In addition, comorbid psychological disorders are common in the ASD population (Simonoff et al., 2008), and may cause substantial distress and impairment beyond that caused by the ASD diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety disorders, in particular, affect as many as 80% of children and adolescents with ASD (Bellini, 2004; de Bruin et al., 2007; Klin et al., 2005; Muris et al., 1998). Although efficacious interventions have been developed for otherwise typically developing youth with anxiety disorders, the linguistic; cognitive; and social characteristics of ASD may render standard treatment approaches less effective for children with ASD (Volkmar & Klin, 2000). Thus, there is a clinical need for the modification of existing treatment modalities for this unique group. To date, few studies have experimentally tested the efficacy of CBT for youth with a comorbid presentation of anxiety and ASD. This gap in the literature is of particular concern given the prevalence of comorbid anxiety among children, consequences of untreated anxiety, unknown efficacy of antidepressant medication for anxiety in ASD, and potential safety and tolerability issues related to medication use. Accordingly, we are proposing a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of CBT relative to treatment as usual (TAU) in 46 youth ages 7-11 with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorder(s). In the proposed grant, we will: (1) examine the acute efficacy of CBT relative to TAU, and (2) evaluate the short-term maintenance of treatment gains. Forty-six children (ages 7-11 years) with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorder(s) will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment conditions. Primary outcomes will be assessed by an independent evaluator, and will include change in anxiety symptom severity; response rates; and remission rates. Considering the rising number of children diagnosed with ASD, our proposed work toward the advent of an efficacious CBT protocol will provide a timely contribution to public health efforts.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT04672486,"BACKGROUND:||PRIDE has been implemented in India to address the scarcity of evidence-based interventions for common adolescent mental health problems nationally and in low-resource settings more widely. The goal is to develop and evaluate a suite of scalable, transdiagnostic psychological interventions (i.e., suitable for a variety of mental health presentations) that can be delivered by non-specialist ('lay') counsellors in resource-poor school settings. It builds upon India's national initiative for adolescent health, launched in 2014, which emphasises mental health as a public health priority and schools as an important platform for youth-focused treatment delivery.||The development of the PRIDE school-based intervention model has been founded on the principle of stepped care which reserves increasingly specialised, resource-intensive interventions for individuals who do not respond to simpler first-line treatments. Previous PRIDE studies (Parikh 2019, Michelson 2019, Michelson 2020) revealed a high demand for school-based psychological support among socially disadvantaged adolescents. A majority of these adolescents do not meet conventional clinical thresholds for mental disorder, but may still benefit from early intervention to mitigate risks for developing more severe and socially disabling mental health problems in the longer-term.||Hence, the aim of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an online 'open-access' digital intervention for adolescents who have a felt need for psychological support irrespective of assessed psychopathology. Online delivery is necessary due to prevailing COVID-19 restrictions that include school closures and a shift to online schooling for the remainder of the academic year.||SIGNIFICANCE:||This study comprises one of the first online adolescent mental health trials in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak in India. The study will take an existing digital mental health intervention developed and evaluated by our group in India and repurpose this platform for online delivery.||Problem solving was selected as the core intervention component based on global evidence for its generalised (i.e., transdiagnostic) benefits across diverse mental health presentations and its specific relevance to common stressors observed in the target population.||The findings are likely to be generalisable to routine settings since the research will be implemented in government-aided secondary schools which cater to low-income communities. External validity will be further strengthened through idiographic outcome assessment alongside standardised assessment instruments, and broad eligibility criteria which do not exclude any specific mental health presentations.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT00490802,"Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by abnormalities in speech and communication, impaired social functioning, and repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. A number of researchers have suggested that the neuropeptide oxytocin may be implicated in the etiology of autism.||Given the likely possibility of dysregulated oxytocin in autism, the goal of this pilot study is to investigate the long-term therapeutic effects of oxytocin in the treatment of autism. One practical issue with oxytocin is that it does not exist in a pill form. Only the intravenous form is available in the United States and this form may or may not pass the blood-brain barrier. In addition, intravenous oxytocin is not practical for treatment studies. One alternative is intranasal oxytocin; this form of administration is known to pass the blood-brain barrier, and it is easy for participants to self-administer. Although not available in the United States, we are in the process of receiving an Investigational New Drug exemption for its use and can import it from Europe.||Thus, this pilot investigation will explore daily intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of autism. Also, there are very few, if any, outcome measures to assess social functioning in the ""real world"" in the context of clinical trials; yet, this is a major target for intervention, especially in autism. Thus, a final goal of this study will be to explore the use of Event Contingent Recording to index changes in social functioning and affect. Event Contingent Recording is a methodology developed by personality/social psychologists, which allows participants to report on symptoms, affect, and behavior close in time to experience. In addition, to enabling more sensitive assessments, this methodology allows for the assessment of more diverse (e.g., at home versus work) and more detailed measurements of mood and behavior.||Finally, a portion of this study aims to perform gene expression profiling using fresh whole blood to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying oxytocin therapy and oxytocin efficacy in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. The systemic effects of oxytocin therapy and the molecular basis for a positive treatment response to oxytocin are not well understood. An understanding of the former may help predict those persons who may suffer side-effects from treatment and the latter may help provide easily accessible peripheral biomarkers that could predict treatment response.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT02573246,"Despite significant advancements in psychiatric research, the majority of adults with mental health disorders do not benefit from current evidence-based treatments, especially if they have difficulties managing negative emotions. One solution to this unmet clinical need is to take a neuroscience-informed approach to treatment development in order to radically change patient care. Despite an explosion of research on the neurobiological underpinnings of emotion, emotion regulation, and psychopathology, there have been few attempts to use such findings to advance behavioral treatments. Neuroscience-informed treatment development could optimize psychotherapy gains and reduce burden on therapists and clients. Therefore, we propose to build a fundamentally novel approach to treating difficulties managing negative emotions (or emotion dysregulation) that builds on the strength of current therapies, but that also accelerates and enhances gains.||Adults with several different psychiatric disorders have difficulty managing negative emotions, a problem that has been traced back to impairments in the fronto-limbic brain circuitry. In healthy samples this neural network is activated in response to tasks requiring regulation of emotional arousal and disrupting this circuit leads to psychiatric symptoms. In psychiatric samples, this circuit is underperforming as evidenced by (1) hyperactivity in the amygdala (the brain structure that signals emotional arousal), (2) slow return to baseline after amygdala activation, (3) hypoactivity in frontal regions (responsible for regulation), and (3) insufficient cross-talk between these regions when patients experience negative emotional arousal. Evidence-based cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and neurostimulation are two different interventions that can remediate function in impaired brain circuits. Both interventions have evidence of success in changing the fronto-limbic network but also need improvement. Therefore, the investigators plan to combine magnetic brain stimulation and cognitive restructuring (an evidence-based behavioral treatment for difficulties managing emotions) in a one-session intervention.||The investigators propose to recruit 65 transdiagnostic adults (i.e., who meet criteria for any DSM 5 disorder) who engage in cognitive restructuring with low frequency as measured by an established questionnaire and to randomly assign them to either real or sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). All included participants will practice reducing negative emotions (induced with standardized autobiographical stressors) using cognitive restructuring while undergoing high frequency or sham rTMS to the right or left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Standardized, established procedures will be used to teach cognitive restructuring, to generate personalized stressors, to induce negative emotional arousal, and to implement the one session of rTMS. Immediate effects will be evaluated using measures of emotional arousal and regulation during the intervention and for one week afterwards using 8 daily automated mobile phone calls. Long-term effects in emotion regulation, functional and psychiatric impairment will be examined at 1-week and 1-month follow-up interviews. The investigators hypothesize that rTMS will enhance cognitive restructuring by yielding a quicker reduction in emotional arousal when compared to sham TMS, and will lead to more frequent use of the cognitive restructuring in the natural environment. If successful, this study may be the first in a series of investigations using innovative paradigms to optimize treatment for psychiatric disorders and it could lead to the next generation of neuroscience-informed behavioral interventions.||An additional 40 participants will be recruited for the study using identical inclusion/exclusion criteria as the main portion of the study, however, if their score on the emotion regulation questionnaire is above the low frequency, a group of participants who meet for medium to high frequency on the scale will be allowed to participate in this arm if the also score high on the difficulties with emotion regulation scale and meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria as well as can undergo an MRI. Participants in the imaging portion of the study will undergo an MRI before the intervention day. This imaging session will include training in the emotion regulation task to be performed in the scanner, including practice in reappraisal and distraction; a memory cue assessment to rehearse cuing of memories; a mock scan if necessary, MRI safety screening confirmation, structural (Diffusion tensor imaging and anatomical) and functional MRI (fMRI) images will be collected. During the fMRI scan, participants will complete the emotional regulation task where they will be asked to recall an emotional memory from the Emotional Memory selection tasks and then be cued to reappraise, distract or allow negative emotions. At the end of the trials, participants will rate their current emotional state. Participants in the imaging portion of the study will be randomized to sham or left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex stimulation only. After undergoing the intervention visit, they will then return to complete a second MRI after 1 week where they will reoriented to the emotion regulation task, have structural and functional MRI images collected with the emotion regulation task occurring during the fMRI portion.||They will also complete the online questionnaires as the other groups and then will return to the clinic within 30days for the final follow-up visit.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT02305537,"The study population will involve all assenting/consenting patients, both male and female, admitted to the McLean Anxiety Mastery Program at McLean Hospital. This program provides intensive group-based treatment for anxious youth (aged 6-18). Patients in the McLean Anxiety Mastery Program participate in a minimum of four weeks of treatment and attend the program for four days per week. Three days per week, patients attend group-based treatment for two-and-a-half hours per day. The fourth day of each week consists of a one-hour group-based treatment, a one-hour family meeting, and a one-hour exposure session that includes children and their caregivers. One day per week, parents also attend a one-hour parent guidance group as part of the overall treatment package. Patients also have psychopharmacology consultations with the program psychiatrist on a case-by-case basis. On their first birthday that falls after the date of discharge, patients are sent a birthday card that includes a greeting and reminders about coping skills that they learned in the program.||The investigators expect to recruit at least 45 assenting/consenting patients in the first year of the study.

The same questionnaire battery also is administered on the same day as the semi-structured interviews at each of these time points. The semi-structured interviews takes approximately two-to-four hours to complete, and the remainder of the battery, the self- and parent-report measures, takes approximately 15 minutes.||Trained Independent Assessors conduct the interviews, and the self-report questionnaires are administered through REDCap Survey, a secure, HIPAA-compliant program for building and managing online surveys. The self-report measures are completed at secure computer terminals on-site at the program. If families are unable to travel to the program to complete surveys while on the waitlist or at follow-up, the Independent Assessors will use REDCap Survey to send two survey links (i.e., a parent survey and a child survey) to the caregiver and child.

NCT01563003,"This study will further examine a treatment plan for adolescents with autism spectrum disorderS (ASD) and anxiety. Many children who have an autism spectrum disorder experience substantial anxiety that can cause impairment above that of an ASD alone. Few studies have examined effective treatment options for anxiety in this population. In typically developing youth, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered the gold standard for treating anxiety. But, in order to address the unique needs of children with ASD, this study utilizes a modified CBT treatment plan which includes social skills and parent training. In our past studies, this cognitive-behavioral treatment plan has been effective in kids with ASD and anxiety compared to kids who did not receive any treatment.The current study compares this modified treatment plan to other treatment options in the community. The experimental component of this study is being assigned to 1 of 2 groups. The first group will receive CBT immediately for a period of 16 weeks. The second group will have to wait 16 weeks before receiving CBT. During this time period, children may receive any other services in the community. Overall, all adolescents receive the same type of therapy; it's matter of whether he/she receives it immediately or after a wait period. Sixteen weekly sessions comprise CBT. All therapy and assessments associated with this study will be free of charge.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT03225430,"Tics are defined as repetitive non-voluntary contractions of functionally related groups of skeletal muscles in one or more parts of the body. Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (TS) forms a separate diagnostic category with multiple tics including vocal (phonic) tics occurring several times per day, for at least 1 year with onset before age 18. Persistent (chronic) tic disorder (TD) may involve a single motor or vocal tic. Tics peak around age 11 but can persist into adulthood with a prevalence of 1% and if untreated cause significant impairment. The current treatment guidelines for managing the tics recommend a Behavioural treatment, ""habit reversal"", which focuses on reversing the tic habit, now developed as a Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics (CBIT). CBIT involves multiple stages including awareness, relaxation, contingency training, positive reinforcement for not do the tic and the practice of a competing response antagonistic to the tic. A recent large scale multisite study compared CBIT with supportive therapy and found a significantly greater decrease in adults and children tics treated with CBIT. However, in both adult and child studies, 48-62% of samples were classified as non-responders. Effect sizes were medium (Cohen's d´= 0.55 - 0.68) compared to supportive therapy with mean tic decrease of 25-30% and samples remained symptomatic at follow-up. Research over the last 10 years (funded by the CIHR) have led to elaboration of a cognitive behavioural psychophysiological model of treatment (CoPs) of tic disorders. The CoPs is multi-modal and targets cognitive, behavioural and physiological processes characteristic of tic disorders rather than focusing on reversing the actual tic at onset. In the last funding period 2009-2013 the investigators have successfully applied the program to all subtypes and severity of adults with TS/TD both with and without comorbidity and compared outcome with a natural waitlist control. Results showed a clinically significant reduction of tic frequency following CoPs (Cohen's d- 1.43-2.34), maintained at 6-month follow-up. Validity of the CoPs model was supported by a change in behavioural and psychosocial as well as tic symptom measures post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up, and a post-treatment normalization of participants' performance on neuropsychological and electrophysiological measures.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT04239729,"The efficacy of an ACT self-help website for hoarding will be assessed through a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial. Participants will be recruited from within the United States through a variety of channels. Given the need to recruit a targeted sample with clinical levels of hoarding symptoms, online advertisements through Facebook and Google AdWords will be the primary recruitment method. Participants will complete an initial brief screening, provide consent, and then complete a baseline survey. Each of these steps will be completed online and participants will be automatically guided from each step to the next. That is, those who screen as eligible will be automatically directed to an online consent form, and those who provide consent will be automatically directed to begin the initial online baseline survey. They will be randomly assigned automatically upon completing the baseline survey to either use the ACT self-help website and receive supportive coaching for the next 8 weeks, or wait for the next 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, participants will be asked to complete a posttreatment survey. They will be asked to complete a final, follow-up survey after an additional 4 weeks after the posttreatment survey. After the follow-up survey is completed, waitlisted participants will be provided with access to the website. The website will implement a self-help version of ACT. Participants will be asked to complete 16 brief self-help website sessions, each taking around 15-20 minutes to finish, twice a week for eight weeks. Participants assigned to the website condition will also receive coaching.The purpose of coaching will be to help participants engage with the website and adhere to the intervention.

NCT01947647,"Objective To evaluate the transdiagnostic CBT in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of VAMC patients with depressive/anxiety disorders by investigating its preliminary efficacy in reducing symptomatology, comorbidity, and improving quality of life compared to behavioral activation therapy (BAT) (psychotherapy control condition). Patient satisfaction and predictors of feasibility (attendance and dropout) also will be assessed.||Recruitment Strategy VAMC patients will be recruited through the Primary Care - Mental Health Integration program and CBT Clinic at the Ralph H. Johnson (RHJ) VAMC. Within these programs, all VAMC patients reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety meet with a mental health staff member to complete a diagnostic interview and self-report measures as part of their standard clinical practices. If VAMC patients endorse symptoms consistent with a depressive/anxiety disorder, the patient's interest in participating in research will be assessed and, if agreeable to research, patients will be put in contact with research staff (same day meeting and/or follow-up phone to schedule research assessment). A research assessment will be completed with the project staff to first complete consent documentation and then assess inclusion/exclusion criteria (with a targeted sample of 96 VAMC patients; > 72 completers), including a semi-structured clinical interview and self-report questionnaires focused on the psychiatric symptoms and quality of life. Participants who meet diagnostic criteria for the targeted disorders will be randomized into a study condition, and will be assigned to a project therapist. Because most VAMC patients who meet study criteria likely will present with multiple depressive/anxiety disorders, principal diagnosis, or the most impairing of the diagnosable disorders, will be used to select patients for participation. To balance diagnoses across the two conditions, a stratified random assignment based on principal diagnosis will be used for the most common principal diagnoses (MDD, PTSD, and PD).||Procedures Eligible VAMC patients will be randomized into one of two treatment conditions: transdiagnostic CBT or BAT. Both treatment conditions will include 12-16 weekly 50-minute individual psychotherapy sessions. The total number of sessions will vary slightly depending on participant needs and progress during therapy, as is common in most CBT approaches to psychotherapy (and will serve as a covariate in the outcome analyses). The general format of sessions will involve: 1) brief check-in; 2) review of materials from previous sessions; 3) review of homework assignments; 4) overview of new materials and in-session exercises; and 5) assignment of homework for next session. Attendance and homework completion will be recorded.||Randomization Procedures Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to one of the two study arms (n = 59 per arm) using a permuted block randomization procedure. Randomization will be stratified by principal diagnostic group and block size will be varied to minimize the likelihood of unmasking. After determining eligibility and completing consent and baseline assessment materials, enrolled participants will be assigned to treatment groups by the Project Research Assistant using a computer generated randomization scheme. Once a participant is randomized and attends the first session, they will be included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Randomization will occur at the participant level.||Transdiagnostic CBT Treatment Condition As noted above in the Preliminary Studies section, a transdiagnostic CBT protocol was developed and revised through two demonstration studies and one focus group. The resulting protocol involves several primary components, including psychoeducation on the symptoms of depression and anxiety (session 1), assessment of motivation and setup of treatment plans (session 2), exposure therapy (sessions 3-15), and relapse prevention (final session). In addition to these primary components, optional modules are included to supplement exposure therapy later in treatment to address secondary symptoms (e.g., anger, sleep, hypervigilance, drinking to cope). The goal of these modules is to allow providers to tailor treatment to specific symptoms that may be present in any single or set of diagnoses that may be reducing the effects from the primary exposure approach. Session will be weekly for 45-60 minutes with homework assignments to be completed between sessions.||BAT Control Condition To provide an evidence-based comparison for the transdiagnostic CBT condition, a second group of participants will receive manualized BAT. BAT is based on early behavioral models that suggest that decreases in positively reinforcing healthy behaviors are associated with the development of negative affect. In general, BAT involves teaching patients to monitor their mood and daily activities with the goal of increasing pleasant, reinforcing activities and reducing unpleasant events. BA is a brief treatment, can be administered in either individual or group formats, and has demonstrated reliable effectiveness across a wide range of university, community, civilian and Veteran clinical samples with depression. BAT also has been shown to be effective in the treatment of PTSD and other related depressive/anxiety disorders in Veterans. In the present study, the BAT condition will be manualized, following an existing protocol in the literature. BAT will be structurally equivalent to the transdiagnostic CBT with the same session length (45-60 minutes), frequency of sessions (weekly), duration of treatment (12-16 sessions), and amount of homework.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

NCT04111874,"Anxiety disorders affect 50-80% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and are associated with significant life impairment and worsening trajectory without treatment. The most effective psychotherapy for anxiety in youth with and without ASD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but many families are not able to access CBT due to the cost, practicalities of attending treatment sessions, and limited availability of trained therapists. Alternative models of service delivery are greatly needed, with particular promise of parent-led therapist-assisted (PLTA) models and telehealth delivery formats. Parents may benefit from additional information regarding how to optimize the delivery of CBT for youths with ASD given the potential impact of ASD symptomology on core CBT skills. Thus, this project aims to improve access to anxiety-focused Parent-Led Therapist-Assisted CBT for parents of youth with ASD. Parent-led low-intensity treatment models can improve accessibility, efficiency, and mental health treatment cost. Lower intensity treatment models provide a treatment option that is less costly and burdensome for parents; it is understood that some individuals will respond to the first step and others will require additional treatment to achieve anxiety reduction. However, understanding how many families, and which families, can benefit from a lower intensity model has dramatic benefits for improving access, allocating more intensive services for those most in need, and reducing barriers (e.g., distance). Thus, this study will examine the effectiveness of two anxiety-focused PTLA CBT telehealth models: 1) low-intensity therapist assistance (LTA) and 2) standard therapist assistance (STA). Overall, this study will provide important information regarding the potential benefits of two different approaches to parent-led interventions for youth with ASD and anxiety when delivered via telehealth.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT03720795,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects as many as 1 out of 59 individuals, with many higher-functioning youth not diagnosed until school-age or later. This equates to ~102,000 children under the age of 14 years in the state of Texas alone. Significant impairment in social and adaptive functioning are common, as are comorbid behavioral health disorders, with anxiety disorders affecting between 50-80% of youth with ASD. Given the relative frequency of anxiety disorders among children with ASD, the associated impairment, and worsening trajectory over time without intervention, there is a great need for treatment that specifically addresses anxiety-related symptoms in ASD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been established as a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders among youth with and without ASD. A particular form of CBT, Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with ASD (BIACA), has demonstrated efficacy in a number of studies. However, treatment is delivered by therapists as ""full-packages"" (i.e., 12-16 clinic sessions), which can be therapist-intensive, costly, impractical for families, and not responsive to parental preferences. Alternatives approaches, such as parent-led, stepped-care models that improve accessibility, are efficient, provide personalized care, and lower mental health treatment cost, are greatly needed. Stepped-care models provide a lower-intensity first step (e.g., parent-led, less costly, and more convenient for parents) as the initial treatment with the assumption that a proportion of individuals will respond to the first step and others will need to step up to more intensive treatment. Matching treatment to families' needs and tailoring subsequent treatment may be an efficient and effective approach, as well as consistent with parents' desire to help their child. Given this, together with the substantial impairment associated with clinical anxiety in individuals with ASD across the age span, this study implements a parent-led, flexible, individually-tailored cognitive-behavioral intervention for children with ASD and anxiety.",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
NCT01075672,"Cognitive behavioral interventions are the most widely studied and evidenced-based psychosocial treatment approaches for mental health and health related behavioral problems. Despite their documented efficacy, there is a scarcity of licensed mental health professionals who are available to treat patients with problems that would be amenable to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). While CBT interventions have a strong base in terms of efficacy in randomized trials, effectiveness and dissemination studies are lacking in comparison, and hence, these interventions are not reaching the patients in most need of services. Complicating the problem further, insurance companies typically do not reimburse for services provided by trainees who are not licensed. This is a public mental health problem because it limits the degree to which CBT clinicians can be trained to deliver these treatments, and a particular problem at MGH because referring providers do not have a place to send their patient for CBT services, as trainees constitute a large portion of clinical staff. To address this issue, the current study seeks to document outcomes of CBT interventions delivered by credentialed but not licensed trainees. This information can be used to guide policy and reimbursement guidelines for trainees, as well as promote the ability to disseminate efficacious interventions. Information gained from this project will be used to provide feedback to insurance companies, licensing boards, and mental health community stakeholders regarding decision making re: reimbursement for care provided by supervised trainees.

Potential subjects will be told that all information gathered during screening is confidential. If a potential subject does not meet inclusion criteria, or decides not to participate, the screening information will be destroyed. This information is then passed to the study physician, Dr. Kagan, who will contact potential subjects to make an appointment for further evaluation. Potential subjects are encouraged to discuss their possible participation in this study with their physician, therapist, and/or family members. They are also encouraged to write down questions they would like to ask the study physician upon further evaluation. This screening process is done as part of the research process.||Further Evaluation: After the initial telephone screening, potential subjects will meet with the principal investigator, Dr. Eda Gorbis, who will ask the subject to sign an informed consent form (ICF). The research procedures and treatment will be described in detail to the subject and any questions will be answered by the principal investigator. The ICF will be signed by the subject and the principal investigator, agreeing to those procedures in the study that are considered research, acknowledging that their participation is voluntary, and that they have been informed of the risks and benefits of the study. Research procedures include cognitive testing, standardized rating scales, and clinical assessment questionnaires discussed below.||When the ICF is signed, the potential subjects will meet with the study physician, Dr. Kagan, for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and physical assessment to confirm a primary diagnosis of BDD according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), and identify any confounding comorbidity, physical health, or medication issues which may or may not preclude their participation in treatment. According to subjects' self-report, those who are currently on medication for their BDD must have a regular prescribing physician who can continue prescribing their medication.||Upon confirmation of inclusion into the study, subjects will then be given appointments for cognitive testing and further clinical assessments by the study independent evaluator. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for DSM-IV (M.I.N.I.; Sheehan & Lecrubier et al., 1998) will be used to determine comorbid disorders that are excluded from the study, which will take approximately 45 minutes to complete. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Third Edition (WAIS-III; Wechsler 1997), which is an instrument that assesses verbal and nonverbal intellectual functioning, will be used to determine subjects' cognitive capacity, and will take approximately 90-120 minutes to complete.||Assessment Instruments: One week prior to treatment, subjects will be administered a battery of clinical rating scales and questionnaires to determine the severity of their BDD and any secondary symptoms. This same assessment battery will be given immediately following treatment to determine the level of efficacy of each of the two treatment groups. These scales include the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Modified for BDD (BDD-YBOCS), Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination-Self Report (BDDE-SR), BDD Diagnostic Module (BDDDM), Y-BOCS Symptom Checklist, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Ham-D), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Fixity of Beliefs Questionnaire, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), NIMH Global Obsessive-compulsive Scale, Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS), Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI), Obsessive-Compulsive Rating Scale (OCON), Fear Survey Schedule (FSS), and the Revised Willoughby Questionnaire. These will take approximately 90-120 minutes to complete.||Randomization: Following assessment, subjects will be pseudo-randomized into either the mirror retraining treatment group or the crooked mirror treatment group. Pseudo-randomization means that subjects will first be assigned to one of the two groups randomly, then group membership will be remixed if needed to assure that there is no significant between-group difference in pretreatment BDD-YBOCS scores. If possible, groups will also be matched for age and gender.||Intensive Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: After subjects complete the pre-treatment assessments, the study therapist will meet with participants to design their treatment program. Treatment will be conducted every day for 15 days, Monday through Friday, for 90-minute sessions. In addition, as a part of therapy, subjects will complete homework assignments daily. Intensive CBT for BDD is done in the form of Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) with either the mirror retraining method or the crooked mirror externalization therapy.

NCT03642951,"STUDY OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS||Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects nearly 1% of children world-wide. While it can be treated with drugs and behavioral therapy, other modalities are being sought, especially, in cases that are resistant to standard treatment. One such approach that is being tested in pilot clinical studies is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Noninvasive magnetic stimulation of the cerebral cortex is an important and useful technique in neuroscience research, as well as in diagnostic and therapeutic clinical investigations. Over the last three decades the magnetic stimulation procedure is being carried out using a device called transcranial magnetic stimulator (TMS), which uses a large hand-held electromagnetic coil passing high amplitude current to induce a rapidly changing magnetic field at a single cortical site. TMS has found clinical application in several neurological and psychiatric conditions such as stroke, major depression, migraine, movement disorders and Tourette syndrome. One limitation of conventional TMS, besides the bulkiness of the device and the large amount of current involved, is that it allows stimulation at only one cortical site at a time. Dr. Santosh Helekar of Houston Methodist Research Institute (HMRI) and Dr. Henning Voss of Weill-Cornell Medical College (WCMC) have developed a compact portable and wearable multisite transcranial magnetic stimulation (mTMS) device that can deliver stimuli at multiple cortical sites simultaneously or sequentially. It uses rapidly rotating small high strength permanent magnets to induce currents in the brain. As opposed to conventional TMS, the mTMS device is also ideally suited to conduct double-blind placebo-controlled studies because undetectable demagnetized magnets can be intermixed with actual magnets to allow rapid rotation of either type of magnets to be activated in one and the same device in a randomized protocol. Under a previously approved HMRI study protocol this new device has been shown to induce motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in thenar muscles by highly focused stimulation of their cortical representation in the precentral gyrus.||In the present pilot study, the investigators would like to conduct a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the therapeutic effectiveness of bilateral mTMS stimulation of the supplementary motor areas (mTMS-SMA therapy) in TS patients presenting with tics uncontrolled by standard drug and behavioral treatment. The specifics aims of this study are:||To compare the immediate benefits obtained by TS patients subjected to two weeks of five day per week mTMS-SMA therapy with respect to those obtained by TS patients receiving placebo (sham stimulation) treatment, in terms of reduction of the frequency of tics and alleviation (primary end points) and of other comorbidities (ADHD and OCD, secondary end points) of TS.|To compare the long-term benefits as above over a two-month follow up period in the same set of treated and placebo control TS patients||The investigators will conduct this study in 20, English speaking, TS patients in the age range of 8 to 20 years. Half the patients will be randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to the active treatment or the placebo control (sham treatment) groups that will be appropriately age-and gender-matched.

NCT03830190,"Background The Parkinson's Disease Nurse Specialist (PDNS) can fulfill a pivotal role in the multidisciplinary team of people with PD. The PDNS was introduced in 1989 in the United Kingdom to bridge the gap between medical management and the unique personal needs of patients. To obtain greater uniformity in care delivery by a PDNS and to facilitate the efficacy of nursing care in PD, the Dutch Guideline 'Nursing care in Parkinson's disease' was published in 2016. The main roles of the PDNS are clearly described in the Guideline, and include 1) providing information, education and instruction; 2) supporting the patient and caregiver in the promotion of self-management; 3) supporting psychosocial care questions; 4) prevention; 5) specialized diagnostic strategies and therapeutic nursing interventions; and 6) multidisciplinary collaboration.||Based on expert opinion from healthcare professionals, the Dutch guideline advises that every person with PD could benefit from PDNS care, including those in early-stage disease where delivery of information, education about medication compliance and support in self-management are critical. So far, only three studies have evaluated PDNS care and they have found inconsistent results. Overall, they indicate that PDNS care may improve patient wellbeing, physical functioning and general health status and reduce anxiety and depression, but definite conclusions could not be drawn. Moreover, there is little evidence that shows that quality of life actually improves with PDNS care and to date, no studies have been performed that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PDNS care.||Currently, most hospitals in The Netherlands offer PDNS care, since it is advised in the Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline. However many centers still lack the nursing capacity to offer PDNS care to all patients because the scientific evidence is inconclusive. This situation creates an undesirable inequality in access to care and presumably leads to avoidable disability and costs (e.g. from early admissions to nursing homes or crisis admissions to the hospital). Therefore, the investigators aim to study the cost-effectiveness of specialized nursing care provided by a PDNS as compared to no PDNS care for people with PD.||Study design The NICE-PD study is an 18-month, single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial that will be performed in eight community hospitals in the Netherlands. A total of 240 people with PD will be included (120 in each group) and equally distributed over the participating hospitals. The investigators have selected hospitals where, due to lack of sufficient PDNS staff, only a proportion of PD patients currently has access to PDNS care. This provides the investigators with a unique opportunity to identify patients who at present have no access to PDNS care, and to randomize them within hospitals (at the patient level) between PDNS care and no nursing intervention.||Eligible patients will be allocated randomly to either PDNS care or usual care in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer-generated list of random numbers. To ascertain an equal representation of patients, the investigators will stratify for disease duration (according to pre-defined subgroups, i.e. disease duration <5 years, 5-10 years and >10 years). The PDNS intervention will be carried out according to the Dutch 'Guideline Nursing care in PD'. A blinded researcher will perform the clinical assessments at baseline (t0), after 12 months (t1) and after 18 months (t2). Patients and caregivers will also be asked to complete a set of questionnaires at t0, t1 and t2. Finally, every three months patients and their caregivers will complete an online questionnaire about healthcare utilization, costs and productivity loss.||Intervention||The PDNS intervention will be performed according to the Dutch 'Guideline Nursing care in PD' published in 2015. The intervention is not standardized, but tailored to the patients' and caregivers' needs. This includes the following:||Assessment of individual care needs of people with PD and their caregivers. The PDNS performs a specific nursing assessment related to the medical, physical, psychological and social domains.|Development of a patient-centered treatment plan that supports the patient and caregiver in self-management. The PDNS composes a multidisciplinary plan, based on the results of the individual assessment, and as prioritized by the patient and caregiver (shared decision making). The treatment plan is developed according to the national self-management framework.|Specific nursing interventions. The intervention varies across disease stages and is tailored to the specific problems and needs of individual patients and their caregivers. The Guideline on PDNS care describes general- and specific nursing interventions. General interventions consist of providing information and education, disease management (e.g. considering advanced treatment options such as DBS) and monitoring (e.g. of caregiver burden). Specific nursing interventions are described for the following areas: mental functions, fatigue, sleep, urogenital functions, sexuality, medication adherence, orthostatic hypotension, caregiver burden, coping, mobility, self-management and dietary issues (table 2 provides examples of such interventions).|Collaboration with other healthcare professionals. The PDNS stimulates and supports multidisciplinary collaboration between healthcare professionals based on the individual patient-centered treatment plan. The PDNS also plays a pivotal role in the timely referral to other healthcare professionals.||The PDNS will keep a pre-defined electronic study report according to a structured format for each PD patient, documenting the individual care needs, present symptoms, performed interventions and (changes in) the individual care plan. This report will be started at the initial assessment and updated at every follow-up contact with the patient, e.g. at the outpatient clinic, during a telephone consultation or at a home visit. This data will be purposefully collected for a possible process analysis at the end of the study.||Patients will have regular contact with their PDNS about the progress and realization of the personal goals, both during face-to-face contacts and by telephone, and sometimes during additional home visits. The frequency and type of contact will be optimized for each patient depending on disease stage and individual patient needs. The Guideline on PDNS care advises that each patient has a minimum of one contact with the PDNS each year. Currently in the Netherlands, patients are seen on average twice a year by their PDNS, with an additional two interim telephone consultations per year.||The control group will receive ongoing/ usual care which is otherwise comparable, but without a nursing intervention. This involves regular consultations with a neurologist in their own community hospital (typically 2-4 times per year, depending on patient preferences and health status). In addition, control patients will have no other restrictions considering any other medical treatments (e.g. by a psychologist or social worker). Importantly, many important elements of care (including in particular the treating neurologist) remain comparable between the two intervention arms because of the randomization at patient level within hospitals.||Clinical assessments At baseline, t1 and t2 all patients will visit their own hospital for the study assessments which are performed by a blinded researcher (PDQ-39, MDS-UPDRS, and TUG). Furthermore, the patients and their caregivers will complete additional home questionnaires. In addition, every three months, patients will receive a questionnaire at home regarding healthcare utilization, costs and productivity loss over the past three months. Caregivers will complete a cost questionnaire including healthcare utilization, costs and productivity loss specifically related to caregiver burden. Patients can choose if they want to fill out digital or paper questionnaires.||Data analysis The economic evaluation investigates, alongside the clinical trial, the value for money of full implementation of the PDNS into PD care from a societal and healthcare perspective. The investigators will take all relevant costs into account. The cost-effectiveness timeframe adheres to the clinical study protocol and evaluates cost-effectiveness up to 18 months after randomization. Cost will be measured using a healthcare utilization questionnaire (e.g. including medical consultations, hospital admissions, medication, travel costs, etc.) and a questionnaire measuring productivity loss while working of both patients and caregivers. Per item of healthcare consumption, standard cost-prices will be determined using the guideline for performing economic evaluations. If standardized prices are not available, full cost prices will be determined using activity based costing. Costs will be analyzed using a mixed model approach or a general linear model approach with a gamma distribution using a log link to account for possible skewness of the cost data.||The investigators will use a PD-specific quality of life measure (PDQ-39) and a generic health-related quality of life scale (EQ5D) to evaluate the quality of the health status of patients. The potential difference in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) measured with the EQ5D will be analyzed with a regression approach. The investigators will use a linear mixed model with repeated measurements to test for differences in quality of life (measured with the PDQ-39) between both groups. The same analysis will be used to measure differences between groups in the secondary outcome measures. The investigators will include study center as a random effect and fixed effects for group, time and the interaction between group and time. Each of the outcomes will be included as dependent variable. Statistical analyses will be performed based on the intention-to-treat principle.||Besides the overall cost-effectiveness evaluation, the investigators will perform a pre-planned subgroup analysis based on disease duration (diagnosis made <5 years, 5-10 years or >10 years ago) to obtain more insight into the nursing interventions used in each disease stage and the effects of PDNS care in these different groups of patients. This subgroup analysis will be performed because, for example, for the more severely affected patients the nursing intervention is expected to become more intensive and possibly more effective, but also more expensive. When different patterns of this kind are found, this should be investigated further in future trials that are powered adequately to address such group differences.||Discussion The investigators hypothesize that offering PDNS care will lead to higher quality of life with equal healthcare costs. Increasing direct medical costs (for nurse staffing) are expected to be offset by a reduced number of (telephone) consultations with the general practitioner and neurologist. These short-term goals are the focus of the present NICE-PD proposal. In addition to the short-term effects, the investigators also expect long-term benefits, which are out of scope of the present project. Examples of potential long-term benefits include a reduction in the number of nursing home admissions and fewer emergency visits to the hospital, which would lead to a substantial cost reduction.||In conclusion, this study will generate new insights into the cost-effectiveness of specialized PD nursing interventions for people with PD. If positive results are found, a large shift in the organization of PD care is needed to warrant equal access to PDNS care for every person with PD.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT04553185,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the abnormal deposition in the brain of aggregates called Lewy Bodies, packed with a protein called α-synuclein. The mechanisms why this protein accumulates in the brain of patients with PD, as well as its relationship with clinical symptoms, is unknown.||Recently, an internal mechanism of drainage of waste proteins called glymphatic system has been identified and characterized. This system is silent during wakefulness and works during sleep. When it is active, a virtual space between the blood capillaries and cells of the brain called astrocytes opens and lets out waste products from the brain. This process is mediated by a protein of the astrocytes called Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Preclinical studies have shown that the function of this system could be critical for the clearance of β-amyloid, a protein linked with the development of Alzheimer's Disease. Studies in humans have shown that genetic variations some parts of the AQP4 gene, defined as single nucleotide polymorphisms, may increase the likelihood to develop an aggressive form of Alzheimer's Disease. However, no studies in humans have ever been performed in Parkinson's disease and α-synuclein.||In this study, the investigators aim to elucidate whether genetic variations in the AQP4 gene contribute to variations in the clinical presentation and progression of sporadic and genetic forms of Parkinson's disease.

NCT02168842,"The study will enroll 336 participants in this multi-center study at approximately 56 sites across the US and Canada. In this study, we are comparing 10 mg of Isradipine to Placebo for treatment of newly diagnosed PD patients. Isradipine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat high blood pressure but is considered investigational in this study, as it has not been approved for use in patients with PD.Isradipine can affect the function of specialized channels that are present in the types of brain cells that are affected in PD patient. These cells are usually responsible for making dopamine, which is depleted in patients with PD. Isradipine may block the damage caused by the flow of certain chemicals through these channels. Laboratory data has showed that Isradipine may prevent the development of Parkinson-like symptoms in animal studies. Isradipine has been evaluated in some patients with PD. The first study with isradipine controlled release (CR) in patients with early PD and normal blood pressure found that the drug was reasonably well tolerated and safe. The controlled release formulation of isradipine is not available for use and therefore this study is using the immediate release formulation.

NCT00282802,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a growing health problem in the elderly, and genetic factors may provide substantial clues toward eventual treatment and/or prevention of the disorder. The National Academy of Sciences/National Resource Council (NAS/NRC) World War II (WWII) Veteran Twins Cohort Registry is one of the few population-based groups of elderly twins. Previous studies in this group indicated that genetic factors were involved only in early-onset PD, however there was no follow-up to these studies.||The purpose of the ""Twins and the Risk of PD"" study is to follow-up previous studies and confirm the initial findings. In this study, investigators will use the NAS/NRC WWII Veteran Twin Cohort Registry to compare the concordance rates for PD in monozygotic and dizygotic twins-at least one of whom has PD.||The overall goal of this research is determine the contributions of genetic and environmental factors in the cause of PD.||The study will involve traditional clinical research methods, such as a clinical examination, as well as innovative imaging techniques, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). SPECT-a nuclear imaging test involving blood flow to tissue-is used to evaluate certain brain functions.||Findings from this study may help to set research priorities in PD, and to develop tools for early detection of the disorder.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT01573260,"There is accumulating evidence for positive effects of exercise on gait speed, strength, balance, and quality of life for people with PD. Habitual physical activity can lower risk for developing PD. In toxin-induced animal models of PD, exercise may decrease neuronal injury. The key components of an exercise program in PD include: 1) cueing strategies to improve gait; 2) cognitive movement strategies to improve transfers; 3) exercises to improve balance, and 4) training of joint mobility and muscle power to physical capacity. Traditional exercise programs can meet these needs but often they are not very appealing for older adults including patients with PD. Unfortunately more than half of individuals with PD does not meet the recommended daily level physical activity.||There is a connection between music and level of Dopamine, which is pivotal for establishing and maintaining behavior. According to recent study music-induced emotional states can increase dopamine release, partially explaining how musical experiences are so valued and why music is an especially potent pleasurable stimulus for most people, and is frequently used to affect emotional states.||The development of interventions which combine exercise, with accessibility, enjoyability, good motivation to practice regularly improving mood and stimulating cognition would be ideal for individuals with PD. Dance may provide all of these characteristics, and so may be an affective useful and accessible intervention to improve motor impairments. Dance requires dynamic balance and permanent adjustment to the environment at the same time. It promotes enjoyment and encouragement interest in continuing participation. Habitual social dancers have superior balance, gait function, and reaction times compared with age-matched nondancers. Regular dancing improves balance and functional mobility, and increases motivation to continue healthful exercise-related behaviours in older adults.||There is also evidence that exercise has a positive impact on cognitive function in vulnerable populations. Musical exercise improved cognitive function in residents of long- term care facilitations without diagnosis of dementia and in patients with established Alzheimer's disease. Particularly dance produces clinically important changes in measures of mental status and behaviour in patients with moderate to severe dementia.||Social isolation is an important cause of the development of depression in the older population and it may be caused by numbers of factors, including mobility limitations: medical illness, and economic difficulties. The relationship between social isolation and depression is clear, as is the link between social engagement and improved mood and perceived quality of life. There is also an important link between social disengagement, depression and cognitive decline in elderly population. Dance classes occur in a group setting and it is forced social interaction, which may produce noticeable improvement in mood and subsequently decrease cognitive decline.||There is currently an insufficient body of literature on dance for PD and much additional work is needed. Most studies on dance in PD have used small sample sizes and assessed short-term effects and long-term effects of dance intervention only focused in motor manifestations of PD. Consequently, the effect of dance on cognition, mood and motivation has not been yet explored in PD. There is insufficient literature about what type of dance is more beneficial for motor and non-motor manifestations in PD.||Why Argentinean tango?||Better improvements of balance and complex gait were observed in elderly participants in tango lessons compared with a walking group. Beneficial effect of Argentine tango was also suggested, compared to traditional exercise for improving balance and functional mobility in patients with PD. Furthermore, a positron emission tomography (PET) study has shown increased activity in the basal ganglia when tango movements were performed with a metered and predictable beat. Tango requires particular motor skills, including frequent initiation and cessation, a variety of movement speeds, rhythmic variation, and spontaneous multidirectional perturbations. These features target motor impairments with movement initiation, turning, and bradykinesia. Interesting, tango could also effectively address freezing of gait (FOG), because some step patterns mimic the rehabilitation exercises designed for those with FOG. Visual cues, such as a foot to step over, can improve FOG. Tango technique which involve stepping over a partner's foot, tapping a partner's foot, or crossing one foot over another, are steps similar to conventional rehabilitation for FOG. In addition, tango involves rhythmic rocking, or alternating shift of center of mass from foot to foot, which can be another good strategy for freezing. Tango appeared to have a larger effect on freezing compared to other styles of dancing (waltz/foxtrot). Tango involves the practicing of control of movement speed and size, which may improve walking velocity and stride length. It also adds slow and quick steps of varying lengths and requires continual adjustment of these features. Tango may be especially beneficial for addressing backward walking, a critical area given the tendency for falls in the backward direction in PD6. Surprisingly in a recent study, tango even significantly improved upper extremity function, which it may be reflective of a global impact of exercise on bradykinesia. Better improvements of balance and complex gait were observed in elderly participants in tango lessons compared with a walking group. No studies have examined the effect of tango on cognitive function, mood and motivation in patients with PD.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT04327687,"Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is a procedure whereby ischaemia is induced to a limb for short periods of time by inflating pressure cuffs around arms to above systolic pressures (mmHg). This procedure induce neurohormonal, systemic or vascular changes in the body. Such changes often result in improved collateralisation of blood supply to various areas of the body, as well as improved efficiencies of cellular metabolism. RIC has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with heart attacks, strokes, but is not investigated for PD. We argue that RIC may exert neuroprotective effect on PD due to its multiple mechanisms. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of RIC on long term outcomes in patients with PD.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT02045420,"Experimental plans: All patients and controls will consent to be subjects in this study. Data will be collected on the Siemens Skyra 3T scanner at the University of Saskatchewan using a 16 channel head/neck coil arrangement. The investigators main approach in this research is to collect MR data on the vasculature in the brain and neck, the iron content in the brain, and standard anatomical scans for 20 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 10 age matched normal subjects. MR venography, flow quantification and susceptibility weighted imaging will be used.||Anatomic MR venography (MRV): Contrast enhanced MRV is widely regarded as the optimal method for evaluation of disease involving the dural venous sinuses. It is an accurate, reliable and robust method for assessing sino-venous pathology such as thrombosis and tumor invasion. MRV is also able to demonstrate pathology involving larger cerebral veins. The investigators will be able to record both anatomic variants as well as any stenosis. Extracranially, the investigators will look for any significant variants or stenosis affecting the jugular venous system, the vertebral venous system and the azygous system. Data will be analyzed to separately display and evaluate the structure of arteries and veins in the head and neck. The maximum intensity projection (MIP) of the whole series will be generated in the coronal view. The major arteries will be evaluated as well as major veins of interest for the structural analysis including the transverse sinuses, the internal and external jugular veins, vertebral veins and deep cervical veins which usually serve as collaterals in case of flow abnormalities in the jugular veins. Cross sectional areas (CSA) of suspicious stenotic regions will also be measured to validate whether the variation seen in these CSA are veins stenosis or not.||Flow quantification (FQ): Pathological change in cerebrospinal venous drainage will be reflected by upstream disturbance of venous flow. Phase contrast MR flow techniques allow the investigators to interrogate venous flow. By applying FQ techniques to the dural venous sinuses, investigators hope to characterize the interplay between anatomic venous obstruction and pathologically altered drainage. By understanding this relationship, the investigators can gain deeper insight into the mechanism by which cerebrospinal venous insufficiency interacts with iron homeostasis mechanisms and ultimately with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Dural sinus hemodynamics can be studied non-invasively with phase contrast FQ. The phase contrast flow quantification (PCFQ) images will be used to analyze the through-plane cerebral spinal fluid in the neck (C2/C3 level), as well as blood flow in the neck (C2/C3 and C6/C7 levels), the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), both left and right transverse sinus, the straight sinus, both the extra cranial jugular and vertebral veins and Dural Sinus. Areas of interest will be drawn around the veins and arteries of interest and flow will be calculated over a full cardiac cycle. Thirty time points will be collected for each cardiac cycle by using a retroactive pulse trigger. The vessels of interest will include: the internal and external jugular veins (IJVs, EJVs), vertebral veins, deep cervical veins, common carotid arteries and vertebral arteries. The investigators will be evaluating the integrated flow, the average velocity, the volume flow rate, as well as negative and positive flow rate. This will be assessed in the cervical arteries to compare the inflow and outflow of the brain. Abnormalities may be identified by stressing the system, i.e., with a breath hold. Finally a large number of quantitative measures will be made on all the arteries and veins in the neck to assess both individual variants and total flow in the brain.||Measuring Iron in the basal ganglia and thalamus using Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI): A presence of iron not only in lesions, but now more importantly in the basal ganglia and thalamus has been shown in IPD patients. The latter shows iron build up at the confluence of the draining veins in these areas. SWI can be run to show iron deposition in several areas of interest within the brain. SWI has very high spatial resolution and is an optimal method to study the small internal cerebral venous system. The ability to measure the amount of non-heme iron in the brain will facilitate a better understanding of the disease progression and may help in predicting the treatment outcome. Iron deposition will be evaluated from the SWI images. To measure iron content in grey matter, investigators will look at iron in the following eight regions: caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, pulvinar thalamus (as it appears to be affected much before the rest of the thalamus), substantia nigra, red nucleus and dentate nucleus. For each deep gray matter structure, two major regions of interest will be analyzed: the entire object drawn manually and the region-of-interest that has much higher iron content. The investigators will provide the following information for these regions: iron content in the abnormal part of the structure (the investigators refer to this as the high iron content region); the area of this region; the average iron per pixel in this region; and also the investigators will quote the same three values for the total iron in these structures.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT03337464,"Purpose: To assess 15 subjects with PD and 15 healthy controls, who exercise on a regular basis, before, during and after 30 minutes of pedaling exercise intervention. The investigators will assess subjects for alterations in motor cortex assessment, cognition and mood as measured by EMG/EEG, motor assessment and several batteries of questionnaires. Findings from this study will lay the foundation for long-term studies.||Hypotheses: The investigators anticipate to observe an altered involvement of motor cortex during steady pedaling in individuals suffering from PD. In healthy control subjects it is anticipated that changes in cognition will be observable.||Justification: Hindered movement initiation and continuing locomotion is a common syndrome in PD with profound impact on the patient's mobility and quality of life. So far, the underlying pathophysiology is not completely understood. Since the observation that cortical activity contributes to the muscle activity during locomotion-like tasks underpins the importance of corticospinal function in humans, it is of importance to examine whether this cortical involvement is altered and displays abnormalities in patients with PD. Thus, the approach of corticomuscular coupling during a locomotion-like task would allow for better understanding of the pathophysiology of PD, a prerequisite to develop therapies. Findings of this study will lay the foundation for future long-term studies.||Additionally, by examining the oscillatory EEG patterns during the exercise intervention, the investigator will be able to read out the dose response curve in real time, which will provide information on the optimum intensity and duration of exercise. Findings will help to design future studies and to develop efficient exercise therapy interventions for people with PD.||People living with PD often suffer from cognitive decline, depression, and fatigue. By assessing cognitive function before and after the exercise intervention, there will be laid a foundation for future studies investigating the effect of exercise on cognition. The collected pilot data will be relevant to learn more about the effects of exercise on mood and fatigue as well as concomitant obstacles and facilitators during exercise interventions in patients with PD.||Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to investigate if activity that arises in the motor cortex and contributes to the muscle activity during moderate pedaling is altered in patients with PD compared to healthy gender- and age-matched controls. Thus, to better understand the role of the motor cortex and its contribution in simple automated repetitive tasks in patients with PD there will be analysis of the coherence of the coupling between EEG and EMG from active leg muscles during cycling on a stationary bicycle both in subjects with PD and age and gender matched healthy controls.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT01835652,"The purpose of this study is to determine the basis for symptomatic and disease modifying benefits of exercise in Parkinson's disease (PD).||Although the benefits of exercise in PD have been purported for several decades, only recently have there been controlled reports of symptomatic benefits in Parkinson's disease in terms of bradykinesia, postural balance and quality of life. There have been unsubstantiated suggestions that exercise may improve cognition and mood in PD.||The mechanisms underlying such benefits are poorly understood. Exercise may induce dopamine release, thereby contributing to improved motor function in the dorsal striatum, and to enhanced mood and reduced apathy in the ventral striatum.||We will test the hypotheses that exercise results in altered synaptic plasticity in the form of altered connectivity in response to aerobic exercise and reward-induced dopamine release.

NCT02476240,"Parkinson's disease is a slow progressing neurodegenerative movement disorder with both motor and non-motor symptoms. The gold standard medical pharmacotherapy (levodopa) lends relief from symptoms. However, some of the non-motor symptoms are not responsive to this therapy or eventually become non-responsive, such as impaired proprioception (sensory feedback from the limbs providing awareness of one's body in physical space). Although it is unclear as to why levodopa is unable to relieve proprioception impairments, a key underlying mechanism that may be responsible is an impaired sensorimotor integration (the combination of sensory and motor information in the brain utilized to guide movements). This is not the result of corrupted input information from proprioceptors into the brain (such as muscle spindles and golgi tendon organs), but rather the downstream integration of this information in the brain. With faulty signalling through the area of the brain damaged in Parkinson's disease (the basal ganglia), deficient sensorimotor integration impairs patients' ability to rely on sensory feedback during movement. This subsequently impairs ability to automatize learned movements in Parkinson's disease and causes previously automatic movements (such as walking) to require conscious control (lose automaticity). This is problematic in instances where attention is diverted from a movement that is no longer automatically controlled, such as engaging in a conversation while walking. Without attention on the movement, motor control breaks down, leading to heightened chance of falls and injury. However, Wulf and Colleagues (2009) demonstrated that when individuals with Parkinson's disease focused externally, and greater reliance on sensorimotor integration was fostered, balance control was improved compared to when these individuals focused attention internally. This suggests that individuals with Parkinson's disease may retain ability to rely on sensorimotor integration. Therefore, by fostering neuroplasticity through the basal ganglia with the utilization of exercise, and improving ability to rely on sensorimotor integration in individuals with Parkinson's disease (by using dual task training), automaticity of movements may be improved, subsequently decreasing the risk of falling and injury. Furthermore, by improving sensorimotor integration, symptom severity might improve and disease progression may slow.||In addition to providing improvements to symptoms of Parkinson's disease, this will provide a greater understanding into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying improvements associated with exercise rehabilitations employed for Parkinson's disease. To date, goal-directed exercises have yet to investigate the rudimentary aspects of the exercise, since no studies have directly compared identical exercise regimens while participants focus ""internally"" on the movements of their limbs compared to focusing ""externally"" on the movement of an object that is being manipulated. For this reason, this study will investigate large magnitude gait and balance training in two groups, one focusing internally on limb movements throughout the exercise program, and the other focusing externally on the movement of coloured labels attached to their limbs. The gait, balance, stretching and coordination exercises that will be provided in the proposed intervention to the two exercise groups will follow the exact Parkinson's disease Sensory Attention Focused Exercise (PD-SAFEx™) protocol designed by Sage and Almeida (2009). PD-SAFEx™ is a group setting intervention, which will be led by the primary investigator who is trained in conducting the exercise protocol. The first half of the exercise class will include walking exercises that include large magnitude and coordinated movements. All walking will be performed slowly. Walking exercises will be followed by balance, stretching, and coordination exercises while sitting in, or standing near, standard office chairs, utilizing latex Thera-bands®. To ensure that balance and coordination are constantly challenged throughout the intervention, the exercise program progresses each week, increasing in difficulty.||Sixty-five participants diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease will be recruited. This present intervention study will span over a 20- week period. Pre-assessments to measure baseline symptoms and functionality will be conducted over the initial 2-week period prior to the start of the intervention. After pre-assessments have been conducted, participants will be randomized to one of three groups:||Group 1: Internal Focus of attention Exercise (Original PD-SAFEx™) While performing the exercises in PD-SAFEx™, participants will be instructed to focus their attention on sensory feedback. This will include focusing participants' attention on the stretch in their limbs while walking, on the straightness of their backs while sitting, on limb and body orientation in space while coordinating their movements, and on chest movements during breathing exercises. Throughout each exercise session, the instructor and volunteers will constantly provide attention-directing instructions.||Group 2: External Focus of attention Exercise (Modified PD-SAFEx™) While performing the exercises from the PD-SAFEx™ program, participants will be instructed to focus their attention towards the movement of coloured labels attached to their hands, elbows, knees and feet.||Group 3: Control Group This group will be asked to refrain from changing activities of their daily lives throughout the 20-week duration of the experiment (from pre-assessment to washout).||The exercise program will follow the pre-assessment baseline measures, and will last 12 weeks. Each exercise session will last 60 minutes, and will be provided three times per week. Post-assessment of all outcome measures tested prior to the intervention will be assessed in a 2-week period immediately after the cessation of the exercise program. The washout period will last 6 weeks; thereafter assessments will be completed again. Since the present research study aims to understand the mechanism underlying these rehabilitations, as well as ensure ecological validity, symptom severity (UPDRS-III) will be assessed in all individuals in both the ""ON"" and ""OFF"" state of dopaminergic medication. Since the individuals are in the ""ON"" state during all daily activities, exercise classes will be performed in the ""ON"" dopaminergic medication state. If there are individuals who are naïve to dopaminergic medication (De novo), they will only be assessed once (in the ""OFF"" dopaminergic state).

NCT03137238,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is classically characterized by a decline in motor function, marked by the hallmark symptoms of akinesia, bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor as well as impaired posture and balance. However, non-motor symptoms are also recently becoming recognized as a major part of the disease. Non-motor symptoms may include sleep disorders, mood disturbances, hallucinations, cognitive impairment, and various sensory and perceptual deficits. In contrast to the motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms are less observable by nature, and can therefore go unnoticed if not tested directly.||Already, early studies revealed broad visual dysfunction in PD. This includes delays in visual evoked responses and abnormalities in contrast, spatiotemporal and color sensitivity. PD patients also have altered perception of visual orientation as well as complex visual impairments. Yet, despite their visual deficits, PD patients seem to be functionally more dependent on vision, versus controls. This seems to contradict established principles of optimal sensory integration, according to which, impaired cues should be less relied upon. However, this can only be gauged within a principled framework that measures, quantifies and compares the precision of relevant perceptual cues. Namely, it is the relative reliabilities of sensory cues that should, according to schemes of optimal (Bayesian) integration, set the extent to which the cues are relied upon (related to further below).||Research has demonstrated impairments in sensory systems, other than vision, such as proprioceptive and vestibular function. Interestingly, many sensory deficits in PD may be closely associated with ""classic"" motor symptoms. For example: : i) dysfunctional vestibular signals may lead to impaired balance control in PD, (ii) proprioceptive deficits impair voluntary and reflexive motor commands, (iii) impairments in spatial perception may contribute to freezing of gait (FOG), and (iv) PD patients overestimate the volume of their own speech, likely reflecting perceptual deficits either by impaired sensorimotor integration or by impaired self-awareness of motor deficits. Also, higher perceptual functions, such as perception of emotion from facial expression, is impaired in parkinsonian patients. Perception of self-motion arises primarily from inertial motion (vestibular) and optic flow (visual) cues. When presented with radial expanding optic flow patterns, PD patients demonstrate altered navigational veering and altered perception of the egocentric midline as well as reduced activation in visual brain areas versus controls. However, thresholds of self-motion perception from optic flow have not yet been investigated, and will thus be measured in this study.||Vestibular abnormalities might also affect perception of self-motion in PD. Recently, Bertolini et al. (2015) found impaired tilt perception in PD, but here too, vestibular thresholds of linear self-motion perception have not been researched directly. Hence, the first aim of this study is to determine the thresholds of unisensory (visual and vestibular) perception of self-motion in PD, using a rigorous and well used paradigm of heading discrimination.||However, in addition to deficits in visual and vestibular perception of self-motion, PD patients may suffer from sub-optimal integration of these cues. Hence, the second major aim is to specifically investigate the integration of visual and vestibular cues for self-motion perception. This will be done in the Bayesian framework of multisensory integration.||The integration of information from different modalities (""multisensory integration"") is vital for intact perception of the world. Theoretical studies, based on Bayesian statistics, have provided a framework to study multisensory-integration with predictions for an 'optimal' strategy. Assuming Gaussian distribution and a flat prior, optimal integration of multiple cues reduces to straight forward linear equation, according to which the multisensory percept is a weighted combination of the underlying cues. Many human and animal studies have indeed demonstrated near optimal cue-integration. Yet, while multisensory integration is an active topic of research in normal brain function, with well-established tools, it has not been studied in PD.The investigators hypothesize, based on the apparent over-dependence in PD on visual cues. PD patients might demonstrate non-optimal multisensory integration (namely overweighting of visual cues). This can have profound effects on basic function.||Adding sensory noise to a stimulus reduces its reliability. In the optic flow stimuli of self-motion through a 3D cloud of dots, reliability can be controlled by manipulating the coherence of the moving dots. For 100% coherence (no added noise), all the dots move coherently according to the direction of simulated self-motion. When noise is added, e.g. to 75% coherence, 75% of the dots move coherently according to the direction of self-motion, whereas the remaining 25% move in a random direction As coherence is decreased the visual stimulus reliability reduces. Recently the investigators showed that different clinical groups (e.g. autism) can respond differently to the addition of visual noise. Hence, as part of these experiments, the investigators will also compare visual perception in the absence and presence of added visual noise. The pathophysiology of PD is often understood to reflect increased neuronal noise (e.g. beta oscillations) hence the investigators hypothesize that external sensory noise might have a stronger effect on PD patients vs. controls (perhaps by the stimulus aggravating, rather than reducing, neuronal fluctuations in PD).||Hence, in this study the investigators have 3 main aims: i) to observe the basic (unisensory) visual and vestibular perception of self-motion in PD, ii) to observe the multisensory integration in PD patients, within the framework of Bayesian inference, and iii) to observe the effects of reducing visual reliability (the addition of visual stimulus noise) on performance in PD. All three aims will be addressed with the same experiment. All participants will come for two visits. PD patients will perform the same procedure once ""on"" medication and once ""off"" medication (the order of which will be counterbalanced between patients; determined randomly in advance). For the ""off"" medication condition, patients will stop taking their PD medication 12 hours before the experiments (until after the experiment). The control group will also perform the experiment twice in order to control the possible artifact of learning effects.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT04579887,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is primarily known and characterized by motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia.

Cardinal features of PD are bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor are common symptoms. But gait, postural instability and balance are common risk factors for falling in these population and have a great impact on the quality of life.||There are various treatments available in the pharmacological and surgical field. However, their effectiveness is not satisfying much and invasive procedures are not cost-effective. With the progression of disease patent often become less responsive to medication and develop various difficulties in their daily activities.||Therefore, Physiotherapy(PT) interventions are very important to rehabilitate the patients affected with PD. It helps to improve movement function, motor performance and increase the quality of life. There is active participation from the side of the patient will be there that keeps the patients motivated.||Among emerging approaches in the field of PT, virtual reality(VR) has been proposed as an innovative and effective method for improving gait, balance and postural instability. Patients of PD faces cognitive impairment which leads to impaired attention during their gait because they are unable to put attention on their posture and balance. So attention is responsible for maintaining posture and gait, leads to reduce dual-task ability which is very important in our daily life activities. So to improve the quality of life by correcting posture and gait cognitive dual-task intervention training plays important role in rehabilitation.||Various studies suggested single intervention to improve gait, posture and balance ability in PD patients.

NCT02578849,"Introduction: The major source of NE in the central nervous system (CNS) is the locus coeruleus (LC), which sends projections to virtually all parts of the CNS, integrating cognitive and autonomic functions with the state of arousal (Sara SJ 2009).||With the onset of pathogenesis of PD in the lower brainstem, early symptoms of PD that include sleep disorder, cognitive deficits, and autonomic dysfunction, may appear prior to the motor symptoms of PD, and these symptoms have been linked to the degeneration of the LC and subsequent loss of noradrenergic innervations in the peripheral and central nervous systems (Rascol et al., 2009, Hawkes et al., 2010, Braak et al., 2003).||The loss of neurons in the LC exceeds that of the substantia nigra in some studies (Zarow et al. 2003), in which it is also argued that the loss may be related to the symptoms of endogenous depression in 40% of patients with PD. In these patients, the severity of motor symptoms also may be aggravated by loss of NE as release of dopamine (DA) and firing of dopaminergic neurons normally are both facilitated by activation of noradrenergic neurons.||Lesion of the LC and the subsequent loss of this facilitation reduces nigrostriatal DA release. Similarly, lesions to both dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons induce more severe motor deficits, compared to lesions of dopaminergic neurons alone (Mavridis M et al., 1999). This relation suggests direct and indirect roles for NE in the emergence and severity of both motor and non-motor symptoms in PD, including depression.||The effects of NE are mediated by stimulation of the three receptor subtypes alpha-1, alpha-2, and ß. In the proposed studies, the investigators focus on alpha-2 and ß-receptors. Of the alpha-2 receptors, the alpha2C subtype is densely expressed in structures of the basal ganglia and therefore may mediate the direct effects of alpha-2 receptors on motor behavior.||However, in contrast to the possible beneficial effects of NE receptor activation in some brain regions, non-physiological increases of NE, after L- DOPA administration, may elicit dyskinesia (Buck et al., 2010) while fluctuations of NE concentration in other regions may contribute to generation of symptoms of depression (Zarow et al. 2003). Thus, several lines of evidence suggest that loss of NE may have direct and indirect roles in the appearance and severity of both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD and in LIDs.||Background:||Noradrenergic treatment of PD: The initial relief from symptoms of PD offered by DA agonist therapy is complicated by the manifestation of motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and psychiatric side effects following chronic treatment (Ahlskog et al., 2001, Fox et al., 2008).||The efficacy of conventional DA agonist therapy to reduce motor symptoms in PD is related to its ability to restore lost dopaminergic innervations. However, recent evidence suggests that activation of non- dopaminergic transmitter systems, including the noradrenergic system may play an important role in mediating the anti-parkinsonian effects of L-DOPA. L-DOPA and DA are sequential precursors of NE, and excitation of noradrenergic receptors following L-DOPA administration may contribute to the anti-parkinsonian effects of L-DOPA ( Schapira et al., 2008). Non-physiologically high release of NE derived from exogenous L-DOPA derived NE may contribute to both co-morbid depression and LID.||It further suggests that therapies that maintain L-DOPA- induced activation of NE receptors at physiological levels would reduce the severity of LID in patients. However, the underlying mechanisms of possible anti-parkinsonian and dyskinetogenic roles of NE remain unresolved. In this project, the investigators propose to identify the mechanisms through which NE conveys both beneficial and adverse effects of L-DOPA in a concerted attempt to help improve current treatment of PD by suggesting therapies that target the non-physiological L- DOPA-induced activation of the NE receptors as a potential contributor to LID.||The investigators developed and validated a novel PET tracer to be used in this project. Carbon-11 labelled yohimbine is an alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist and have been validated in studies with PET in pigs (Jakobsen et al., 2006, Landau et al. 2012) and approved for human use. To show that binding of [11C]yohimbine is sensitive to endogenously released NE, the investigators determined the binding before and after Vagus Nerve Stimulation in minipigs in vivo.||This group of researchers also developed the selective NET ligand, [11C]MeNER, for clinical PET studies in Denmark. Patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls will undergo PET-scans with the above-mentioned tracers to map pathological changes in noradrenergic transporters and receptors in-vivo.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT03793491,"Parkinson's disease leads to quality of life degradation, especially at level of motor complications. Second line treatment can be proposed to patients. There are deep brain stimulation and two treatments by continuous perfusion: subcutaneous apomorphine infusion and intrajejunal infusion of levodopa-carbidopa. These treatments allow improvement of end-of-dose akinesia, dyskinesia, and a diminution of treatments per os. Nonetheless, they also lead to some side effects and complications. Currently, there are no scientific data to compare the efficacy of these two techniques on motor and non-motor symptoms. Choice is made according to the profile of the patient mainly based on side effects risks, and practitioner's habits. There are still no predictive factors clearly defined to judge of the best efficacy of these treatments according to the patients. Moreover, in an additional study named PSYCHO-STIM, the investigator have discovered that personality can be a predictive factor of quality of life amelioration 1 year after deep brain stimulation. It's why the investigator would like to test personality as a predictive factor of therapeutic response after both continuous perfusions that are available for the patients. Thus, patients beginning a treatment by subcutaneous apomorphine infusion or intrajejunal infusion of levodopa-carbidopa will be included. The investigator will evaluate their personality with the questionnaire ""TCI"" (Temperament and Character Inventory) and the investigator will assess their quality of life (PDQ-39), looking for the percentage of amelioration 6 months after the treatment by continuous infusion started.

NCT02756676,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by rigidity, bradykinesia and resting tremor. Beyond these symptoms the principal feature of this condition is the lost of habitual automatic movements and the disruption of different cognitive-motivational processes. These features are related to a pathological dopaminergic tone that alters the cortico-striatal pathways with several consequences on motor and emotional behaviours. Given its complexity PD impact very seriously on patients' quality of life (QoL).||Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) is the standard treatment for the motor symptom of PD and previous studies have demonstrated its positive effect on QoL. However DRT does not reduce axial PD symptoms such as freezing of gait, postural instability and balance disturbances. Further, long-term DRT could negatively impact on cognitive and motivational functions and leads to different motor and behavioural side effects.||In the last years, rehabilitation has been proposed as an effective and complementary treatment for the management of PD and several evidences highlighted the need of a multidisciplinary and intensive approach to achieve good results.||To evaluate the impact of an intensive, multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment (MIRT), on QoL of subjects with PD. Literature data showed that this type of treatment determine a positive effect on both motor and non-motor symptoms. Starting from these evidences, in this study the investigators have examined whether MIRT act positively on QoL and for how long this potential positive effect is maintained.||250 PD patients with Parkinson's Disease hospitalized for a 4-weeks MIRT were enrolled. PDQ39 was administered at enrolment, and at three points after discharge: at 1, 3 and 6 months. The investigators decided to evaluate QoL after homecoming in order to avoid an inpatient state bias.

Cognitive and psychopathological status of patients was also assessed using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAY I-II), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT02175472,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally described as a disorder of compromised dopamine (DA) function in the nigro-striatal dopamine (NSD) system. This system extends from the midbrain, through the hypothalamus and into the forebrain to critical areas involved in the control of motor performance. Restoration of DA content in this system by administering the DA precursor L-dopa or DA agonists reinstates motor control, but provides only symptomatic relief with waning efficacy as the disease advances. Symptoms of depression and sleep disturbances are also commonly seen in PD patients, and the manifestation of these symptoms suggests impaired circadian function.||Although the involvement of the circadian system in PD was intimated in the first formal account of the disorder provided by James Parkinson, it was not until recently that circadian malfunction has been specifically cited as playing a major role in the development and progression of the disease. In addition to scattered reports depicting circadian-like features of PD and related syndromes, a large body of evidence describes the benefits of light therapy in PD from both the preclinical and clinical perspectives.||While the development of a formal understanding has been largely omitted as to the basis for any therapeutic effect exerted by light, recent studies have shown that the nigro-striatal dopamine system is comprised of the same cell type as cells in the retina and the pineal. Such cells are driven by visual input whereby dopamine and melatonin sit in functional opposition to regulate day night activities including sleep, mood, reproduction, anti-oxidation and movement. Hence one may conclude that the circadian system plays a major role in many aspects of PD.||Recent work in PD has also suggested that the efficacy of light therapy is mediated by melatonin and dopamine function in the retina. On this basis it would be reasonable to assume that intervention into the function of the circadian system with light therapy in PD patients might well serve to modify the course and consequences of the disease. The present study serves to extend this finding to the point of providing a practical, non-invasive method for helping patients.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT04569552,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex disorder with a combination of characteristic motor signs and non-motor symptoms. The natural course of PD is modified by the effect of treatments, and over time, these treatments can also be associated with both motor and non-motor complications. At present, there is no biomarker or other gold standard index to determine the severity of PD as a whole. Therefore, measurement of the different aspects of PD and their severities relies on clinically based rating scales.||The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale version 3.0 (UPDRS), published in 1987, was developed to provide a comprehensive instrument for the evaluation of impairment and disability related to PD. Further, the scale attempted to utilize the most clinically relevant aspects of several earlier scales that were already familiar to clinicians and researchers, though poorly validated clinimetrically. The development of this ""unified"" scale was aimed to provide a single scale so that outcomes among different clinical trials could be directly compared. For two decades, the UPDRS was the most used scale for assessment of PD patients and became the reference scale for development of other measures and for the United States and European regulatory agencies.||In 2002, the Movement Disorder Society sponsored Task Force for Rating Scales in PD carried out a review and critique of the UPDRS. Several weaknesses, including ambiguities in wording, the absence of uniform instructions for raters, some metric flaws, and the lack of assessments for many important non-motor symptoms were evident. Therefore, a modified UPDRS, named the Movement Disorder Society-UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS), was proposed to overcome the identified shortcomings. In 2008, the official MDS-UPDRS English version was published along with satisfactory clinimetric results on its performance in a series of over 800 native English-speaking patients and raters. As a result, the MDS-UPDRS has been proposed as the official benchmark scale for PD.||Given the content and structure of the MDS-UPDRS, with inclusion of symptoms impossible to assess objectively (e.g., fatigue, pain, dizziness), a questionnaire for self-evaluation, and a wide body of instructions for raters, the scale has to be cross-culturally adapted and validated. A detailed plan for obtaining equivalent and locally validated non-English versions of the MDS-UPDRS was established by the Steering Committee of the Movement Disorder Society Task Force and Spanish, Italian and Estonian official versions are now available.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT03865121,"Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta that leads to striatal dopamine deficiency. This dopaminergic loss results in motor deficits characterized by: akinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and postural instability as well as non-motor symptoms that might also involve other neurotransmitter systems. The non-motor symptoms may include: cognitive deficits (e.g., mild to severe memory impairment), emotional changes (e.g., depression, apathy and anxiety), sleep perturbations (e.g., insomnia/hypersomnia), autonomic dysfunction (e.g., bladder disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, sweating), sensory symptoms (e.g., pain, visual and olfactory deficits) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., constipation, nausea).||Parkinson's disease current treatment of choice is replacement of dopamine with its precursor Levodopa (L-Dopa), which unfortunately loses its effectiveness and can cause dyskinesia following prolonged usage. This fact motivates the search for new pharmacological strategies to better control the symptoms and/or progression of the disease.||The inverse relationship between smoking and PD has been confirmed by a number of epidemiological studies. Moreover, numerous preclinical studies indicate neuroprotective effects of nicotine. Thus, nicotine may offer a novel intervention in PD. Although use of nicotine patch has been suggested in some neurodegenerative disorders, including PD, the investigators believe that the key for success with nicotinic intervention, particularly in PD, relies on mode of nicotine administration. In our opinion, an optimal nicotinic therapy in PD would consist of pulsatile nicotine delivery (e.g. via nasal spray) similar to pulsatile nicotine obtained via smoking. Pulsatile stimulation of the central nicotinic receptors (achievable via nasal spray) would affect the dynamic of the nicotinic receptors much more desirably than continuous nicotine administration via patch, which can result in continuous nicotinic receptor desensitization. The investigators also believe that nicotine delivered via nasal spray, in addition to its potential usefulness for improving motor dysfunctions, may also be helpful in non-motor symptoms (e.g. cognitive decline and depression) that are commonly associated with neurological disorders such as PD.||Thus, this pilot clinical trial seeks to evaluate the efficacy of treatment during one month with nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol NS®) in motor and non-motor aspects of PD.||Hypothesis: Scores of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) for motor and non-motor symptomatology will decrease after 1 month of treatment with nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol) in patients with PD (stages 2-3 of Hoehn & Yahr).||Research question: Can controlled doses of nicotine administered via nasal spray decrease the severity of PD (stages 2-3 of Hoehn & Yahr) using MDS-UPDRS scores?",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT01301651,"It is common that people who are diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) experience postural instability during daily activities.Recently, postural instability is suggested as the underlying mechanism of falling in patients with PD. Therefore, how to improve postural stability by balance training is an important issue for these patients.||Basal ganglia have been regarded to be predominantly involved in postural control. Several studies suggested that the dysfunction of basal ganglia in patients with PD might play a major role in postural instability. Furthermore, patients with PD might have impaired utilization of sensory information by the basal ganglia.Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) has the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), which provides an objective assessment of the main sensory systems (i.e., vision, proprioception and vestibular system) involved in balance and stability. The role of sensory information under six conditions (i.e., eyes open, eyes closed, sway vision, eyes open sway support, eyes closed sway support, and sway vision sway support) has been studied in patients with PD by the SOT of computerized CDP. Their study indicated that patients with PD demonstrated a significant reduction in sensory integration of proprioception and vision, but no significant difference in vestibular function, as compared to age-matched controls. One study showed that patients with PD had visual dependence as an adaptive strategy partly compensating for the impaired proprioception. However, the other study suggested that the cerebellum might be important for sensory integration in patients with PD.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT01246700,"Currently, there is no cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) and although medication offers symptom reduction, there are many negative side effects associated with medication use. Thus, there has been an increased emphasis on exercise interventions for symptom reduction. Recent research has shown that both sensory attention focused exercise (SAFEx) and strength training interventions improved disease severity more so than other exercise interventions (such as aerobic, aquatic and no exercise). Upon closer examination, SAFEx showed further symptom improvements than the strength training program. Thus exists the need to further examine SAFEx using a standardized protocol - a single-blind randomized double-crossover trial - that has been used sparingly in exercise interventions. In addition, the 30-second chair stand has been implemented into the testing protocol, as it has been shown to be a reliable measurement of functional strength for older adults. This test was implemented in order to identify the functional strength gains, if any, that are associated with SAFEx. It is hypothesized that the SAFEx intervention will improve disease symptoms in PD, and that the results will not be due to strength gains.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT04618679,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most neurodegenerative disease in Taiwan. It is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The estimated incidence of PD ranging from 10-18 per 100,000 person-years with a tread of increasing number over past decades. Although the exact mechanisms of PD have not yet fully clear, many pathological process have shown to be involved in the pathogenesis like abnormal alpha-synuclein, activation of microglia and astrocyte, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and so on.||Several characteristics have been considered to increase the risk of having PD. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that patients with HCV infection might have higher risk of PD. It is common that patients with chronic HCV infection manifest with central nervous system manifestations, such as depression, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. A previous epidemiologic study in Taiwan with a total of 62,276 subjects showed that there is significant correlation between PD and hepatitic C virus (HCV) infection. In the study, the crude odds ratio for having PD was 1.94 for HCV patients.||HCV is positive-stranded RNA virus of Flaviviridae family. Flaviviridae family has many viruses demonstrating neurotropic character and may be associated with encephalopathy. Decreased monoamine transporter binding activity had also been found in HCV infected patients who had symptoms of chronic fatigue and cognitive impairment. HCV can cross blood-brain barrier and has the ability to replicate in the central nervous system. Animal study has shown that HCV infection may up-regulate the inflammatory cytokines, such as sICAM-1, LIX, and RANTES, in the rat midbrain neuron-glia coculture and induced dopaminergic neuronal toxicity. The elevation of choline/creatine ratio on proton magnetic-resonance spectroscopy is also indicative of inflammatory status of brain in patients with chronic HCV infection. it is possible that the direct infection of HCV into the brain induce inflammatory status by microglia/macrophages and contribute to subsequent neurodegeneration. Chronic HCV infection is also associated with systemic cytokine activation including interferon-α and tumor necrosis factor α, which may also affect the neuronal function. It has been reported that the viral eradication on the patients infected by HCV had change of neurocognitive function.||6-[18F]Fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) is an analog of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), which is the precursor of dopamine. L-DOPA is carried into the brain through neutral amino acid transport system and converted to domapine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in dopaminergic neurons. Use 18F-FDOPA as a tracer of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, the dopamine synthesis rate and presynaptic dopaminergic neuronal function can be reflected by the uptake of 18F-FDOPA in dopaminergic neurons. The decline of 18F-FDOPA is indicative of dopaminergic neurons dysfunction and can be used as imaging marker of the severity of PD. The posterior putamen receives the dopaminergic projections from the ventrolateral part of the substantia nigra and is affected earliest in the disease course of PD. 18F-FDOPA has been shown its capacity in differentiating early PD and healthy controls in previous study with lower metabolism in the dorsal putamen even in the early course of PD.||In this project, 18F-FDOPA PET is used as an imaging marker of striatal dopaminergic dysfunction in patients with HCV infection.

NCT03582891,"In this project investigators will develop adaptive DBS algorithms based on cortical and subcortical signals using the RC+S. This bidirectional neural interface is rechargeable (for up to 9 years of use), and is capable of delivering therapeutic open-loop stimulation or closed-loop stimulation. Its sensing capability includes four simultaneous time series channels at up to 1000 Hz sampling rate. In addition the device can stream time series data, and calculate and stream spectral power within a preset bandwidth. Twenty patients with idiopathic PD and motor fluctuations, or medically intractable tremor, will be implanted with unilateral or bilateral RC+S devices, each connected to a standard quadripolar DBS lead implanted in STN or globus pallidus, and to a 4-contact paddle type electrode placed subdurally over sensorimotor cortex. The basal ganglia lead will be used for both stimulation and LFP recordings, while the cortical lead will be used only for recording ECoG potentials, not for stimulation.||Patients with motor fluctuations cycle between a hypokinetic state (too little movement) and a hyperkinetic state (excessive movement). During open-loop DBS, brain state continues to fluctuate between these states and stimulation may induce dyskinesia or inadequately relieve akinesia.||With the goal of maintaining motor function within a normal range away from these two extremes, investigators will develop and test stimulation algorithms that utilize putative markers of both kinetic states. The basic strategy is to automatically adjust stimulation parameters until the physiological signature of abnormal function is minimized. First, investigators will prototype adaptive stimulation paradigms and briefly (2 hours) test them in clinic, using a ""distributed"" configuration (streaming to a computer). Then, investigators will embed these algorithms in RC+S to test chronic and fully closed-loop DBS in a small double-blinded clinical trial. Investigators will pay careful attention to the possibility of progressive reduction in stimulation currents over the course of the study, which could support the hypothesis that ""adaptive stimulation"" might make the brain progressively less dependent on the device. In quantifying DBS amplitude and comparing open loop with adaptive stimulation, an important parameter is the total electrical energy delivered (TEED). TEED is calculated by the following equation as suggested by Koss and colleagues (TEED1sec = ((voltage2 x frequency x pulsewidth)/impedance) x 1sec).

Mental practice (MP) is considered an efficient strategy to improve the motor performance of healthy individuals and people with stroke. However, there is little evidence about its therapeutic results as a tool to improve gait performance in PPD.||Objectives: To investigate the effects of mental gait practice associated with physical practice to improve the gait performance of people living with Parkinson's Disease.||Design: Parallel, prospective, double-blind, multicentre randomized clinical trial.||Setting: Brazilian Parkinson Association.||Participants: Onde hundred and forty four people living with Parkinson's disease in stages 2-3 disease evolution according to Hoehn and Yahr Classification.||Interventions: The participants will be randomly allocated in an experimental group (EG), and a control group (CG).

NCT04472325,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia, restricted mobility, and postural instability. Early diagnosis of PD would be paramount for further treatment and prognosis. The most common neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndrome is known as Parkinson's disease (PD) or idiopathic Parkinson syndrome, if it occurs sporadically (not familial) and its lead clinical symptom is a movement disorder after brainstem-predominant α-synuclein deposition. To distinguish them from Parkinson's disease, other sporadic entities have been named atypical parkinsonian syndromes or atypical parkinsonism. The present review article describes current standards for the diagnosis and treatment of the most important disease entities in this latter group: dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD).||PD is diagnosed mainly by neurologists, based on clinical symptoms. However, there are no objective criteria available for their diagnosis. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often employed in conjunction with clinical judgment, the images are mostly used to eliminate other diseases, rather than to confirm the diagnosis. Other imaging methods, such as Positron Emission Tomography or Computed Tomography, may help in the diagnosis of PD but have harmful effects on the human body. MRI image of patients with Parkinson's disease is usually normal. Previous studies have also indicated that brain-related areas, such as the atrophy of basal ganglia, are not observed until a period of disease progression. However, the shrinkage of brain tissue cannot be used as a criterion for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, because many other diseases are accompanied by atrophy of brain tissue as well. Furthermore, because human brain cells cannot regenerate, It is too late to diagnose or treat when a large number of nerve cells are apoptotic. Since we expect the function of the diseased cells to change first, therefore, if you can detect changes in the patient's brain microenvironment, it is possible to achieve early detection of Parkinson's disease. Magnetic resonance imaging can detect functional images and display functional changes, thus providing an opportunity to detect abnormalities and diagnose diseases early. One of the key technologies in the measurement of functional images is diffusion magnetic resonance imaging.||Diffusion MRI has been widely utilized to investigate the patterns of neural connectivity. Mean diffusivity (MD) and the directionality (fractional anisotropy (FA)) have been studied in epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and noticeably in Parkinson's Disease. Owing to their paramount pathogenetic role in Parkinson's disease, the basal ganglia in general and the substantia nigra pars compacta, in particular, have been the subject of intense MRI investigation.||The plan uses standard anatomic labeling (AAL) to perform whole-brain diffusion MRI to obtain diffusion data for the whole brain parcellation. We will use statistical methods to identify the areas affected by each PD's subtype, we will also identify areas that are likely to be related to the severity of the disease, and then combine these areas for linear regression analysis. We anticipate that diffusion magnetic resonance imaging can be used as a differential diagnosis, as well as to define areas of high correlation with clinical severity, and to be used for accurate disease prediction and future development, and to provide physicians and patients with clinically important information.||The program uses diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to assess clinical status and prognosis for Parkinson's disease.

NCT04174573,"Introduction:||Parkinson disease (PD) occurs due to degenerative changes in the nervous system, dysfunctions of basal ganglia. Patients affected with PD survive with the postural and mobility impairments that leads to impaired quality of life.

Group therapy (GT) intervention is found to be significant intervention in aspects of mobility in various neurological conditions. GT have been used as part of supervised group rehabilitation to improve balance in patient with PD.2 Patients with PD have difficulties with learning of new motor skills, but recent neuro-modulatory techniques by noninvasive brain stimulation helps to facilitate motor skills and regulate neuroplasticity.||Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a therapeutic device that is used to improve motor symptoms of PD, when applied to primary motor cortex M1.

The study will be executed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (Revised, 2013) and National ethical guidelines for Biomedical and Health research involving human participants by Indian council for medical research (ICMR, 2017). The purpose of the study will be clearly explained to the patient with PD. Written informed consent form will be obtained from the recruited patients. The study will be performed between October, 2019 and March, 2022.||Inclusion Criteria||Presence of mild neurocognitive disorders was based on the validated Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) cutoff scores (<23.5)|Based on the Hoehn-Yahr Stage (HYS) staging, severity of PD was categorized as mild (HYS 1&2), moderate (HYS 3) and severe (HYS 4&5). Patient with PD with mild and moderate will be recruited Exclusion Criteria|Patient with PD with associated comorbidities such as stroke, uncontrolled diabetes, sensory impairments such as hearing, vision, etc.|Patient with PD who is not willing to participate in the study Total of X patient with PD will be screened and through convenience sampling method, 34 children will be selected based on the inclusion criteria for the two group pretest-posttest randomized controlled trial. Demographic data will be recorded for all the recruited patient with PD. The patient with PD will be allocated in two groups, Group therapy only (GTO) group and Group therapy with tDCS (GT-tDCS) treatment group by block randomization technique. The total required sample size of, n=128 will be randomized into both the groups. According to it, there will be four blocks, with the matrix design of 4 × 32, where32 being rows. Each row could have four blocks, with one chit (SNOSE - sequentially numbered, opaque sealed, envelopes) in each block containing either the name of GTO group or GT-tDCS group. Total four chits (2 chits for each group) will be assigned to each row and then patient with PD will be allotted to one of the two group based on the randomly chosen chit (SNOSE). Once the entire first row will be allotted, then the next row block will be opened for enrolment. The advantage of this method of randomization is that the number of patients assigned to each group over time would have been approximately equal. By this the unequal allocation of sample size, will be avoided. The concealed allocation of patient with PD to the treatment groups will be explained by using SNOSE.||Both GTO group and GT-tDCS group will receive the structured group therapy programme for one hour duration, twice a week for 6-weeks. In addition to the structured group therapy programme, GT-tDCS group will receive 20 minutes of tDCS application once a week for the 6-week duration.

NCT04232969,"This study is a clinical trial in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), of a drug called exenatide, which is already licensed for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. There have been several groups that have confirmed that exenatide has beneficial effects of nerve cells when tested in the laboratory, which raises the possibility that exenatide may slow down or stop the degeneration of PD. In an open label trial in patients with PD who self administered the drug for a period of 48 weeks, investigators have previously shown that the drug is well tolerated and shows encouraging effects on the movement and non-movement aspects of the disease. A double blind placebo controlled trial involving 60 participants was then conducted which indicated that exenatide may be a ""neuroprotective"" drug, i.e. one that stops the nerve cells dying in PD. The next step is therefore to confirm this ""neuroprotective"" effect and to see whether this effect can be reproduced in a multi-centre setting including a larger number of participants. An important objective is to explore whether any positive effects remain static or increase when the treatment is continued over a 96 week period.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT01080794,"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive means of brain stimulation which can produce changes to brain excitability. Following a series of daily rTMS sessions, this modulation of neural circuits and other distant effects may help some of the motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD for months at a time. Recently, the FDA approved daily rTMS over the prefrontal cortex as a treatment for medication-refractory depression after demonstration of efficacy in sham-controlled trials and its safety profile. Among several small and pilot studies of rTMS in PD patients, rTMS over either the motor cortex or prefrontal cortex has been reported to show beneficial effects on motor and mood (depression) symptoms with no serious adverse events. However, the relative effectiveness of rTMS over motor, prefrontal, or both regions on both mood and motor symptoms, has yet to be established in PD patients.||We propose to conduct a four-center, blinded, sham-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study of fixed-dose, high-frequency rTMS in 160 PD patients who are experiencing depressive symptoms despite an adequate trial of at least one antidepressant. Subjects will be randomized to receive rTMS over either motor cortex, prefrontal cortex, both, or neither (sham-rTMS). Subjects will receive rTMS for 25 minutes over either the prefrontal cortex (the brain region associated with mood and depression), and/or primary motor cortex (associated with motor control), and/or sham-rTMS. After 10 days of rTMS (or sham) treatment over a 2-week period, all subjects will undergo a comprehensive assessment of motor, mood, cognition and quality of life on the first working day after the last rTMS treatment, and after 1, 3 and 6 months post-treatment.

NCT01792843,"Cognitive impairments are frequent in PD, even in non-demented patients. However, there is a substantial heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of cognitive deficits in PD 2 and also in their progression. This heterogeneity possibly reflects the diversity of the neuronal damage caused by the disease and recent studies suggest that these different clinical influence the risk of developing dementia.||Most studies on cognitive phenotypes in PD have used predefined categories, such as demented vs. non-demented, or PD-mild cognitive impairment vs. cognitively intact patients. However, such an approach may miss less obvious or unexpected presentations. To this end, in a first part of this study, we have used a data-driven approach (cluster analysis) to identify different cognitive phenotypes in PD. With such an approach where phenotypical profiles arise from the data without a priori assumptions, five cognitive presentations were identified: i°) cognitively intact patients (19.39%), ii°) patients with slight mental slowing and mild executive dysfunction (41.29%), iii°) patients with slightly impaired overall cognitive efficiency and deficits in all cognitive domains except recognition memory (12.93%), iv°) patients with severe mental slowing, impaired overall cognitive efficiency, and severe cognitive impairment in all domains, including memory (23.88%), and v°) patients with very severe impairment in all cognitive domains (2.51%). From these results, it could be hypothesized that cognitive deterioration in PD progresses along a continuum, with the exception of the fourth group that also exhibits memory deficits. This group may be characterized by a different underlying pathology, or comorbidity with Alzheimer's disease.

Despite the considerable amount of research, we have no consensus about the most efficient physiotherapeutic approach to improve the gait disturbance. Mental practice is considered an efficient strategy to improve the motor performance in healthy individuals and people with stroke. However, there is scarce evidence about its therapeutic results to improve the gait performance in people living with Parkinson's disease.||Objectives: To investigate the effects of mental gait practice associated with physical practice to improve the gait performance of people living with Parkinson's disease.||Design: Parallel, prospective, double-blind, multicentre randomized clinical trial.||Setting: Brazilian Parkinson Association.||Participants: Twenty-two people living with Parkinson's disease in stages 2-3 of disease evolution according to Hoehn and Yahr Classification.||Interventions: The participants will be randomly allocated in an experimental group and a control group. Both groups will perform 10 individual training sessions, two times per week, for five weeks. The training sessions consist of four blocks of mental practice intercalated with four blocks of physical practice of gait under different conditions. The only difference between the groups will be the content of mental practice blocks: the experimental group will perform mental practice of gait while the control group performs non-gait mental practice.||Randomization: Participants will be randomized by ClinStat software into one of two groups: Experimental Group (EG), which will perform gait mental practice; and Control Group (CG), which will perform the non-gait mental practice.||Statistical analysis: The training effects for each primary and secondary outcome measure will be analyzed for the two training conditions (i.e., control and experimental) at the four assessment time points (i.e., pre-intervention, 7 days post-completion and at 30 and 60-day follow-up) using a mixed-design ANOVA with training as the between-group factor and the assessment time point as the within-group factor.

NCT03103347,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating, progressive neurodegenerative disease. The hallmark of PD is loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), which disrupts motor circuit processing in the basal ganglia and results in motor dysfunction including tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. This disruption of motor circuit processing is reflected in abnormal oscillatory neural activity. For example, recordings of local field potentials with electrodes implanted in the basal ganglia reveal a substantial elevation of beta frequency (15-35 Hz) oscillatory activity in persons with PD, and this increased beta frequency activity is suppressed following levodopa treatment and deep brain stimulation.||However, the link between the frequency and amplitude of abnormal oscillations and the degree of Parkinsonian symptoms is unclear. For example, magneto-encephalography revealed that beta-frequency oscillatory activity is elevated over the motor cortices even in persons with early-stage PD, and there were not any clear differences in beta frequency oscillations between newly diagnosed and under treatment PD. However, this study did not address any changes in the frequency of oscillations or distribution of power across frequencies. For example, a recent study has suggested that variability of ongoing beta-frequency oscillatory activity, in this case recorded from the STN, may be more strongly correlated with symptoms than the amplitude of beta frequency oscillations. Therefore, the objective of the investigator's proposed study is to determine whether there are changes in the characteristics of beta frequency oscillatory activity in the EEG over the motor cortex across differing degrees of Parkinson's disease. Such information is critical to understanding the (possible) link between abnormal oscillatory brain activity and symptom severity, as these signals could be used as potential biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy and to inform the design of new methods of intervention||This is an observational, prospective evaluation of the beta content in routine 20-40 minute EEG recordings from patients with PD for varied periods of time. The investigators anticipate running data collection for 4-6 months in an outpatient movement disorders clinic. Subjects will be identified by their physician and then referred to the study team. Patients that agree to participate will be screened and have all questions answered at the time of their routine appointment. If the patient decides to participate and informed consent is obtained, a clinic appointment will be made for study data collection at a later date. Patient will be instructed not to take their normal dopamine replacement medications for 12 hours prior to the EEG study visit as this can interfere with the brain wave activity being studied. At the study clinic encounter, routine recordings will be made from a total of 33 PD patients; 11 with <3 years of PD diagnosis, 11 with >5 but <10 years of PD diagnosis, and 11 with advanced >10 years of PD diagnosis. EEG will be recorded using an FDA template system to facilitate EEG lead placement by research coordinators. Clinical description of PD severity and duration will be collected from each subject through questionnaire and from review of clinical evaluation. A UPDRS score may be determined for each participant. Following the data collection period, the EEG recordings will be indexed, de-identified, and randomly ordered to blind the subsequent analyses.

The Pro-Parkinson manual, distributed in the program since 2012, covers chapters with exercises and guidelines of medical areas, physiotherapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy and dentistry. The physiotherapy section (page 10-21) includes stretching exercises, mobility, balance and strength, plus the guidelines. It has general instructions for the exercises; the sequence describing the same, self-explanatory illustrations and the number of sets and reps / maintenance time to be realized. All exercises are designed so they could be carried out independently and safely in the patient's home. Patients will be instructed to make them with clothes that let free knees and sneakers or shoes (if there jump up to 2 cm) that are attached to the ankle. The exercises will be supervised by the patient or caregiver, own if necessary.||Risks:||With regard to the questionnaires, there may be the risk of embarrassment. To minimize the same, the data collection will be held individually and enabling environment for data confidentiality. If refuses to answer any question, no insistence, as well as any damage to the participant. Pain, muscle discomfort or fatigue may occur during and after the exercises, however, the patient will be advised to discontinue the exercises try a case considered unbearable pain. To minimize these risks, the whole exercise program will be guided to be held in range of motion and pain-free intensity for the safety. During the exercises, you can also change the cardiorespiratory parameters such as blood pressure and respiratory rate. In an attempt to minimize risk, will not participate in the study those who submit changes in blood pressure levels and heart rate and respiratory considered beyond normal.||Benefits:||The direction of this study will bring direct benefits to patients attending the service in order to be a population with few resources to finance a rehabilitation treatment, or with little or no access to such services as with patients in the state . This diagnosis of the study population are described in Coriolanos et al. (2013) that describing the epidemiological profile of patients with PD at HC/UFPE. Moreover, the results will contribute to evidence-based therapeutic practice and the literary collection, fostering new studies.||Data Analysis Methodology:||All study collections will be held at Pró-Parkinson Program at the Hospital das Clinicas, Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Neurology Clinic, and each variable will be evaluated by the responsible employees and physiotherapist, who will undergo a period of training. Outcomes will be analyzed using statistical software SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). To verify the normality of the sample, the Shapiro-Wilk test is used. Upon proof of normality, the results before and after the intervention will be compared within groups, paired analysis, by means of the Wilcoxon test and intergroup, independent analysis, using the Mann-Whitney test. To analyze the results of the Survey CAP and Adhesion, the descriptive statistics from the frequency calculations will be made, high-low, median, mean, standard deviation. The significance level is 0.05 on all analyses. Datas and images through photographs will be stored on the personal computer of responsible physical therapist and counselor, and there are two copies on CD compact disc/DVD. The responsibility of confidentiality of data is the responsible physiotherapist.||Sample Size in Brazil: 28 (14 in the intervention group and 14 for control). To carry out the sample size calculation, the investigators used the statistical program PASS (Power Analysis and Sample Size), version 2005. After simulations, the investigators chose a minimum sample size of 14 patients in the control group and 14 for the intervention group, totaling 28 patients. This number is capable of detecting, with a 82% test power and 5% significance level, a reduction of 3 points in the PDQ-39 scale and UPDRS-Motor for the intervention group compared with no reduction for the control group, using a one-tailed parametric or non-parametric test for independent samples, considering the standard deviation of the reduction on the order of 3 points to the two groups. For all calculations, the mean and standard deviation parameters were expected based on studies Lun et al. (2005), Dereli and Yaliman (2010), Navarro-Peternella and Marcon (2012), as well as clinical experience Pró-Parkinson.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT01336127,Parkinson's disease is a complex disabling condition progressively affecting activities and participation of patients. Occupational Therapy aims to optimise functional performance and engagement in meaningful roles and activities. The lack of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of Occupational Therapy (OT) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) highlights the urgent need for high quality intervention studies. The Dutch clinical practice guideline for OT in PD (2008)offers a good basis for conducting an intervention study. The completed OTiP pilot underscored the feasibility and the need for a large scale trial.||The OTiP study evaluates the effectiveness of OT in improving daily functioning of patients with PD.,Parkinson’s Disease

The randomization process will be completed by the primary investigator, using a computer randomization software. Essentially, participants will all be given numbers which will be entered into the software, which then randomly assigns them to one of the three groups. The groups are: the virtual reality intervention group, the PDSAFEX group and the control group. Dr. Almeida, the tester of UPDRS scores, will be unaware of which groups each participant is in - only I will be aware. I aim to recruit about thirty-six individuals (12 per group). The study will last twelve weeks. It will include: pre-testing and post-testing with a one month follow up. However, due to time constrains the post testing may be completed after 8 weeks so I can begin to analyze data and have a write up for my classmates and professors. There will still be the scheduled post testing and follow up after the fact at the specified original times (12 weeks and 1 month follow up). Participants will come into the MDRC three times per week. Depending on their group they will complete the PDSAFEX training or VR training intervention. PDSAFEX is a scripted intervention run by trained volunteers, it progresses in difficulty week by week. The VR technology group will complete a protocol that is associated with the software system of the device. They will be asked to complete exercises and/games aimed specifically at improving balance. For example, a game where they must dodge incoming objects while maintain good balance. Virtual reality, is also able to be increased in difficulty through changing the environment and/or stimuli characteristics/speed.||The virtual reality group will be exposed to the virtual reality simulation software for about 1 hour and 15 minutes including set up. They will complete a set of activities, games and exercises that are centered around improving balance. The activities and games are included in the software. The environment and difficulty of the protocol can be altered to make it more/less difficult depending on the participant's ability and/progression throughout the study.||The PDSAFEX intervention was created to improve an individual's sensory integration with a focus on improving balance. It consists of a 12-week protocol administered by trained volunteers. Each session lasts about 1 hour.

NCT01174758,"The specific aims of the study:||Aim I. To create a novel, commercially-available system for mobility assessment in clinical trials for Parkinson's disease. We have already developed a laboratory prototype system for the iTUG test, but the computer interface, sensors, and data management system are too cumbersome for use in clinical trials. In this proposal, we will create a robust, user-friendly clinical system for the iTUG test using wireless inertial sensors and a new user interface developed by a Portland start-up company, Automated Parkinson's Disease Monitoring (APDM), headed by a co-investigator. This mobility measuring system will be integrated with a new centralized data management server also developed by APDM, Inc. to support automatic data analysis and data organization for multi-site clinical trials. The feasibility of the new, clinical system will then be vetted by using it in a busy Movement Disorders Clinic.||Aim II. To develop an objective, composite iTUG mobility score. We recently demonstrated that iTUG metrics are more sensitive in distinguishing mobility performance between people just diagnosed with PD from age-matched controls than traditional clinical tests. In this proposal, we will develop a composite mobility score from the iTUG gait and postural parameters most responsive to severity of PD and to the change from the levodopa ON and OFF states. The composite score will be calculated using statistical models that optimize differences in performance between 75 subjects with PD in the ON and OFF levodopa state.||Aim III. To prospectively determine the reliability, validity and responsiveness of the iTUG mobility score. We will perform a prospective study with 60 patients with PD that compares standard clinical measures of postural instability and gait difficulty mobility (PIGD items from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and TUG stop-watch scores) with our new iTUG mobility score in the OFF and ON levodopa states. We hypothesize that the iTUG will have good test-retest reliability, be significantly correlated with standard clinical measures and fall history and be more responsive to dopaminergic state than current mobility tests used in clinical trials. This project will develop, produce, and test a novel clinical balance and gait assessment tool, the instrumented Timed Up and Go test (iTUG) using our new, wearable, inertial sensors and our new clinical trial data management server that automatically transmits, stores, and analyzes data collected with the iTUG. By automatically providing a more sensitive, accurate, and comprehensive method to test balance and gait, clinical trials to improve mobility in patients with Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders will be significantly more effective and efficient.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT00350402,"Facial expressions are complex signals that last only a few minutes and are important for communicating intention, motivation, and emotional states. In humans, a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions alter the tendency to use facial signals. One of the main symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) is diminished facial expressivity or ""masked facies,"" which refers to the expressionless appearance of individuals with the disorder.||Unfortunately, little progress has been made over the years regarding the basis of ""masked faces"" or strategies that might improve facial expressivity among individuals with PD. This is unfortunate because the particular symptom can have significant medical and social consequences ranging from misdiagnosis of depression to the misattribution of negative emotional states and motivation by family members and healthcare providers.||The goal of this trial is to study the effectiveness of a novel, behavioral treatment approach-high intensity respiratory muscle strength training (MST)-for blunting of facial expressions in people with PD. The MST device, a mouthpiece that the participant uses to inspire against resistance, may improve the strength and mobility of muscles around the mouth that are involved in forming facial expressions.||Study participation includes screening, baseline evaluations, 4 weeks of behavioral intervention, immediate post-treatment followup, and a 3-month follow-up.

NCT00591344,"Parkinson's disease (PD) negatively affects the quality of life for a million individuals in the United States. While medication and surgery are the most effective treatments for PD, physicians and people with PD often delay using these treatments because of their considerable adverse side effects. Until a cure for PD is discovered, there is a compelling need to develop interventions that provide relief of symptoms without causing negative side effects.||Recent research suggests that exercise may provide symptom relief in some characteristics of PD. While various exercise interventions appear to effectively improve motor, functional, and quality-of-life issues, the research is mixed regarding the nature, extent and duration of these improvements. Understanding how multiple characteristics of PD change and whether they can be modified by different exercise programs is essential to determining if an exercise program is clinically effective for PD.||This study is designed to compare the initial (six months), and then long-term (2 years) effect that 2 different exercise programs (progressive resistance program or flexibility program) have on neuro-physiological, motor, functional, and quality-of-life issues in individuals with Parkinson's disease.

NCT03981913,"Alterations in cognitive action control in patients with PD are well described from a behavioral point of view. However, there is currently very little information to directly link these difficulties to functional alterations of brain areas, or of efficient communication within large scale brain networks. Thus, the objective of this project is to specify the neuronal substrates linked to the difficulties in cognitive action control observed in patients with PD. The rational is based on the recent findings on the role of theta (4-8 Hz) neuronal oscillations in cognitive action control. Indeed, converging evidence linked this process to an increase in theta oscillatory power around midfrontal electrodes (FCz, Cz) and to an increase in theta functional connectivity with task-relevant brain areas.||The working hypotheses are based on the hypothesis proposed by Cohen (2014). It proposes that the medial frontal cortex (MFC; around the pre-SMA) would be involved in the integration of conflicting information, observable by studying theta oscillations' power. On the other hand, the phase synchronization of theta oscillations between the MFC and the other task-relevant cortical areas would reflect the degree of recruitment of the entire network participating in the implementation of an efficient cognitive control. Thus, according to this model, a conflict situation would lead to two main measurable electrophysiological reactions in the cortex: i) an increase in the power of theta oscillations around the MFC, ii) an increase in theta phase synchronization between the MFC and the other cortical areas (such as the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices) involved in implementing cognitive action control. These two electrophysiological effects will be the main judgment criteria of this study.||The hypothesis is that the behavioral difficulties in cognitive action control observed in PD patients stem from a lack of integration of the conflicting information and / or a weaker communication of this information to the areas implementing the cognitive control of the action. The alteration of one or both of these aspects may explain the weaker cognitive action control observed in patients. Moreover, by inspecting the disrupted brain networks, it will be able to make hypotheses explaining the alteration of cognitive control in PD. For example, a weaker functional connectivity between the MFC and the posterior parietal cortex could indicate a lower redirection of attentional resources following the presentation of a conflictual stimulus. Another possibility would be a weaker functional connectivity between the MFC and the inferior prefrontal cortex, which would rather indicate a lack of recruitment of the inhibitory system.||The main hypothesis will be tested by comparing the performance of a group of PD patients to that of a group of healthy participants whose brain activity will be collected during the realization of a Simon task via a high resolution electroencephalography system. The behavioral performances will be compared as well as the source-reconstructed electrophysiological data. Specifically, the power of the theta oscillations within the medial frontal cortex, as well as the phase synchronization between the other cortical areas involved will be compared between the two groups. Brain-behavior relationships will also be investigated in order to try to link PD behavioral impairments to changes in theta oscillatory power/connectivity.",Parkinson’s Disease

The increase in levodopa equivalent units during the study period was calculated according to established formula[12].||Baseline assessments of unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr, Schwab and England, mini-mental state examination, geriatric depression scale and quality of life score (PDQ 39) were performed. Clinical scoring was blind to patient group and performed in an 'on' state. The UPDRS 3 and adverse events were recorded at each visit. The quality of life score (PDQ 39) was repeated at the final visit.||All antiparkinson drugs were monitored during two 3 month periods (before and after the educational intervention) using electronic monitoring pill bottles (MEMS®, Aardex, Switzerland), a device which records the time and date of bottle opening.||Patients randomly assigned (computer generated and placed in opaque envelopes) to the active (counselled) group were given verbal and written information about the continuous dopaminergic theory, and written advice on optimal medicine timing tailored to their own drug regimen. The counselling explained that in health, brain dopamine is constant, and that fluctuations from Parkinson's medications should be minimised to simulate normal dopamine levels. Control patients received standard care, but also had medication intake monitored using the MEMS device.||Timing compliance (the percentage of doses taken at the correct time interval) was calculated using time intervals which optimise the pharmacokinetic profile, plus a 25% allowance, eg. 3 times daily medication is satisfactory at between 6 and 10 hours. Selegiline 5mg twice daily was excluded from analysis as the second dose is taken at lunchtime to avoid sleep disturbance.",Parkinson’s Disease

These conditions represent everyday activities/environments which can be difficult for people with PD.||This is not an interventional study as participants are not assigned to any specific interventions by the researchers, or followed up to re-assess outcomes other than for reliability testing of the eye-tracking devices used. The study has been ethically approved (NRES Committee North East - Newcastle & North Tyneside 1: 13/NE/0128) as an observational study as participants are assigned to pre-defined groups, and have behavioural measures (primarily visual sampling and secondly gait) observed in the gait laboratory under various walking conditions common to everyday environments.||Study Hypotheses||The over-arching hypothesis of this observational study is that visual sampling during gait in PD will be influenced by cognitive impairments. This study hypothesises that saccadic activity will be restricted in PD compared to controls during gait. Dual task and environmental challenge via a doorway, turn or visual cue will influence saccadic activity during gait.||Specific study hypothesises are:||Cognition will selectively impact on visuomotor control during gait|Visual sampling strategies during gait will be related to selected domains of cognitive impairment||Secondary questions include:||1. Is the Dikablis mobile eye-tracker a reliable means of measuring saccadic activity in PD and healthy controls?||After undergoing screening to confirm eligibility, subjects will be assigned into one of two groups:||Older adult controls (HC; up to n = 40)||People with PD (n = 60)||Recruitment||Participants will be recruited from Movement Disorder Clinics in Newcastle upon-Tyne.

Visual sampling will be assessed with a Dikablis head-mounted eye tracking and electrooculography (EOG) systems. Gait will be simultaneously assessed using a 3D motion capture system (Vicon), which will be synchronised with the eye tracking systems to provide simultaneous data collection. Infra-red markers will be taped to the body and limbs of the subjects using a small amount of double-sided tape, to allow for motion tracking. The Dikablis will also be taped to the forehead of each participant using a small amount of double sided tape.||Reliability testing (subgroup) (session 2 and 3)||In order to examine the test re-test reliability of mobile eye-tracking in people with PD and healthy controls, a subgroup of participants (PD and HC; up to n=25) will return for a second (within approx. 1 week) and third visit. They will be asked to repeat some of the walking tasks outlined above and to sit (with chin rest), stand and walk (on a treadmill) while performing several eye movements to visual targets (horizontal and vertical visual angles such as; 5, 10, 15, 20 degrees) in time with an auditory cue (a 60bpm metronome). Participants will return for the third visit approx. 1 week after the second visit and repeat the reliability testing (as above).||Sample Size||This is an exploratory study and therefore few specific previous examples are available to guide the sample size required. The sample size estimate is based on results from previous work in this research area (PD; n=21) (Galna et al., 2012), other previous similar studies and preliminary pilot work with the Dikabilis mobile eye-tracker, which is a new instrument. Similar studies in this research area have used similar sample sizes (n=2-26), demonstrating that differences between PD and HC groups will been evident.||Statistical Analysis||Analysis Common to all Studies||Statistical analysis will be undertaken using SPSS version 19 or more recent versions (SPPS, Inc. an IBM company). Data checks of all data collected will be carried out independently by two members of the Human Movement Science Team at the Clinical Ageing Research Unit to ensure that data is accurate.||All statistical tests will be carried out at the 5% two-sided level of significance.

Non-normally distributed continuous distributions will be transformed where appropriate to meet the requirements of parametric tests; otherwise equivalent non-parametric tests will be adopted.||Further Analysis||To analyse visual sampling during gait Pearson's correlations will be used to test the strength and direction of the relationships between clinical, gait and saccadic outcomes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to analyse the effect of group (PD, HC), dual task (single task, dual task) and environmental challenge (Straight walk, Door, Turn, Visual cue) on visual sampling during gait.||To analyse reliability repeated-measure t-tests, Bland and Altman plots, intra-class correlation coefficients (Model 2, 1) and Pearson correlations (or non-parametric equivalents) will be used to assess bias, agreement and consistency of saccadic outcomes measured with the Dikablis eye-tracker on two separate occasions a week apart.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT03212014,"Background:||Parkinson's disease is a progressively degenerative disorder. Patients need early screening, therapeutic intervention, and personalized interaction with outpatient rehabilitative treatment. In the past, it had been difficult to meet these goals.

NCT03700684,"Surgical and pharmacological management of the motor-based symptoms of PD has made great strides over the last few decades. The behavioral management of the speech and voice symptoms however, has not grown by the same leaps and bounds. Despite the prevalence of speech and voice symptoms associated with PD, few evidence-based treatment options are currently available. In the face of good efficacy data, the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD) program continues to be the gold standard for voice treatment. LSVT LOUD trains patients to monitor and adjust their vocal intensity when they perceive that their voice is soft. Therefore, the success of LSVT LOUD is predicated, in part, on an individual's ability to self-monitor and self-cue (internal cueing) during speech production. While LSVT LOUD has fostered significant improvements in communication for many patients with PD, not all patients respond to treatment. It has been postulated that underlying sensory and cognitive factors may hinder treatment outcomes. A new behavioral treatment for speech and voice impairment has recently been introduced. The SpeechVive, a small in-the-ear device, uses an external noise cue to elicit louder speech. While LSVT LOUD and the SpeechVive have both been shown to significantly increase sound pressure level (SPL) in patients with PD, the physiologic adjustments supporting these changes in SPL remain unclear. This is an important area of study for two reasons. First, both treatments are exercised-based programs, yet the physiologic changes associated with these treatments are not well understood. Second, there is evidence to suggest that the use of an external cue, such as the noise cue used in SpeechVive training, elicits more efficient respiratory patterns in neurologically-healthy and neurologically-involved patients, in comparison to self-initiated cueing strategies, such as those used in LSVT LOUD. This study proposes to compare the influence of cueing strategy on treatment outcomes by examining simultaneous respiratory-laryngeal adjustments before and after participation in LSVT LOUD (internal cueing) and SpeechVive (external cueing) training. It is important to study respiratory-laryngeal interactions because both of these subsystems contribute to vocal intensity regulation. In addition, exercise physiology studies have indicated that internal and external forms of cueing elicit different perceptions of physical and mental effort during exercise. It is important to understand the patients' level of perceived physical and mental effort, associated with each treatment program, as these variables can effect adherence to the treatment regime. In summary, the proposed study is intended to 1) fill a critical void in the investigator's understanding of respiratory-laryngeal adjustments used to support increased SPL under two evidence-based behavioral voice treatment programs, and 2) to better understand how patients' perceptions of physical and mental effort are shaped by each treatment paradigm. The information generated in this study could potentially lead to more efficient voice rehabilitation for persons with PD.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT03921697,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive movement disorder, mainly due to an altered motor control. Gait impairments are the primary symptoms in patients with PD, with a decreased step length and walking speed, abnormal gait phases distribution, inconstant pace, gait asymmetry and reduced joint coordination. The postural instability and the deterioration of the gait features sensibly increase the risk of falls in these patients, resulting in loss of independence and a worsening of long-term prognosis. It has been clearly demonstrated that motor impairments are connected to a dysfunction of basal ganglia, a brain structure that works as a ""pacemaker"" for the activation (and deactivation) of each sub-movement within a repetitive movement sequence. Disruption of internal rhythmic cues in PD may explain the poor smoothness of the movement execution and the difficulties in regulating stride length, resulting in a cadence increase. Levodopa therapy is the most effective treatment to improve the symptoms in PD, but a long-term administration reduces its efficiency over time and it is responsible for collateral effects (dyskinesia). Hence, researches have investigated alternative non-pharmacological approaches, based on auditory cues as the Rhythmical Auditory Stimulation (RAS). A large number of studies have reported positive effects both after a single session of treatment and after longer training programs, with improved gait velocity, cadence, and stride length as well as in the symmetry of muscle activation for upper and lower extremities. In such studies, RAS frequencies are pre-set as percentages of the patient's preferred walking frequency. Because the duration of all the therapies may change over time, it is necessary a continuous adjustment of the dosage and type of treatment, based both on patients' monitoring of the symptoms and on objective evaluations. Gait analysis (GA) methods have been proposed and validated for the study of physiologic gait and in several diseases. The traditional systems of GA are based on optoelectronic systems, but they are expensive, not portable and requiring skilled operators. The assessment is always performed in laboratories with experimental set-ups, likely different from real-life walking (noise environments, presence of objects and people or unlevelled pavement, different colors).||Consequently, traditional GA is not reliable for the daily control of the treatments or for the assessment of the real-life situations. Recently, researchers have developed wearable systems, based on Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). Even if a considerable number of studies have explored the validity of IMUs analysis, very few have been involved in PD motion analyses. During the last few years, a set of wearable devices embedding inertial sensors, are spread on the market as low-cost solutions for monitoring human motion activities. While, they still have to be fully validated in accuracy, these systems can provide the user information to track his/her own activity. This persuasive technology has a terrific potential to enhance physical activity and motivation of the patients, with the advantage of prolonged and continuous recording.||The use and the analyses of a large amount of objective data (big data set) is the new frontier for an efficient use of scientific time and resources, engaging the care coordination program, saving economic resources, and providing a higher quality of care. In addition, these systems, integrated with a web-based application, telemedicine and mobile smartphones, could help clinicians to address more properly the treatments through a real-time monitoring in an everyday life. Our research group has been involved in the clinical evaluation of different aspects of gait quality in many neurological conditions, PD included. Investigators have already shown as wearable accelerometers could be useful in the quantitative assessment of the dynamic gait stability, in correlation with clinical scores. Researchers have also found that accelerations could be altered in a pathology-specific manner (intellectual disabilities performing different tasks simultaneously). A similar condition can be observed also in PD, showing that only the intrinsic gait harmony significantly correlate with severity of gait impairments. In the recent years, a lot of wearable tools have become available to quantify the daily activity. This is particularly important for possible therapeutic use of the RAS, that is addressed to restore a harmonic pace in patients with PD.||Specific Aim 1: To analyze motor pattern in PD patients in real life setting, gait features will be obtained by wearable sensors in order to relate them with clinical and demographical data.||Specific Aim 2: To improve walking abilities and to reduce the risk of falls in patients with PD, researchers will test a real-time acoustic feed-back (RAS) and alerts from integrated sensors connected with a suitable and easy-to-use application for smartphones.||Specific Aim 3: To improve pharmacological and rehabilitative protocols, investigators will analyze the daily life gait and motility data and the clinical features to test the theoretical risk model of falls.||Experimental Design Aim 1: Patients with PD will be recruited at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Gemelli and Fondazione Don Gnocchi ONLUS in Rome. All included patients will be affected by idiopathic PD. Clinical data will be acquired by a trained neurologist.||Three hundred patients will be remotely monitored through wearable sensors. Subjects will be instructed to wear the sensor for 14 consecutive days. Each patient will have more than 100 measurements every second, generating a large amount of data, which will be stored in a database and subsequently filtered for data of interest. Spatio-temporal gait parameterswill provide information to monitor the performance of patient's walking in order to get an accurate measure of the overall efficacy of the locomotor function. Then, they will be integrated with the electronic patient records. Clinical data, as physician's prescriptions, medical imaging and other administrative data will be recorded. Finally, a risk model for the prediction of falls will be constructed.||Experimental Design Aim 2: After the analysis of the obtained data, an application will be developed (Parkinson App Smartphone Aimed: P.A.St.A.), it will be characterized by reliability, easy-to-use, visual clarity, and affordability.||This application will be able to: 1) record the gait features sending them to a server in the cloud; 2) provide acoustic feedback adapted on patient's gait features (with higher or lower frequency on the basis of the patient's needs and on the predictive risks); 3) provide alert on the basis of risk indices (risk indices will be identified according to a risk model for the prediction of falls) and 4) be updated whenever needed (e.g. after a fall). Fifty patients will be provided with a smartphone, after a training on the use of the software application developed by the team project. They will use the application for a period of 14 consecutive days. Clinical assessments with scales will be performed, pre- and post-use of P.A.St.A., to analyze the motor function and the postural stability and, finally, the quality of life. In addition, the compliance to the adoption of the novel technology will be investigated.||Experimental Design Aim 3: The obtained computational data will be related with clinical features and gait patterns to identify clinical biomarkers for gait impairment in PD. The availability of a big data-sets, powered by the assessments of thousands of patients with PD, will allow the improvement of knowledge on motor pattern in real life setting and to improve the current therapeutic approach.||Metodologies and statistical analyses: All statistical analyses will be conducted using Stata software.||AIM 1 - Data will be summarized as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Continuous variables will be analyzed as means and standard deviations or medians and ranges. Investigators will look for normality by using normal plots or by significance tests (e.g. Shapiro-Wilk W test). The incidence of falls will be measured and the circumstances under which they occur and their consequences will be described, categorized as no injury, minor or major injuries. A multiple logistic regression analysis will be used to determine independent predictors of falls. Variables will be selected for entry into the logistic model based on the results of a univariate analyses. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodnessof-fit test will be used to assess how well the model accounted for specific outcomes. The prediction model for falls will be developed from the results of the multivariate analysis. The predictive score will be calculated by odds ratio based scoring method, and the nearest integer scores will be assigned to each predictor. Model discriminative power will be evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic area under the curve analysis.||AIM 2 - Data recorded will be processed to extract gait and dynamic balance parameters. The incidence of falls, the use of RAS and its correlation to the risks indices within the 14 days of follow-up will be measured. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be performed to compare the number of fall(s) before and after the use of P.A.St.A.||AIM 3 - Spatio-temporal gait parameters, and demographic and clinical characteristics of patients before therapies, will be compared using the Chi squared test, Fisher's exact test, and independent t-tests where appropriate.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT03866603,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders worldwide, affecting approximately 1% of individuals older than 60 years and causes progressive disability.||Clinical signs and symptoms of PD include the following: asymmetric tremor at rest, bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, postural instability, gait abnormalities including festination and freezing. Onset is typically after the age of 50 years and the disease is commonly slowly progressive. The most common initial finding of PD is a resting tremor in the upper extremity. Over time, participants experience progressive bradykinesia, rigidity, and gait difficulty, while the axial posture becomes progressively flexed. Non-motor symptoms are common in all stages of Parkinson disease and they include constipation, seborrhea, hyposmia or anosmia, sympathetic denervation of the heart, depression and/or apathy, sleep disturbances, cognitive decline and dementia. They may appear prior to the movement disorder and can be used as preclinical markers of PD.||PD is mostly considered as idiopathic disease; however more and more data suggest that it is a disease that involves interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The most common monogenic form and the one most closely resembling idiopathic PD is LRRK2 (Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene) associated PD.||The most common monogenic form and the one most closely resembling idiopathic PD is LRRK2 (Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene) associated PD. First identified in 2004, LRRK2 mutations are currently still the most commonly known cause of PD and account for up to ~40% of all Parkinson's disease cases in select populations. The majority of reported LRRK2-positive PD patients are Caucasian (63%), whereas all other ethnicities comprise ~10% or fewer patients of described mutation carriers despite clusters in the Ashkenazi Jewish and Arab Berber populations. With respect to country of origin, the majority of patients were re-ported to reside in Italy or Spain (14% each), Great Britain (10%) or Norway (9%). Definitely pathogenic variants identified in LRRK2 include p.G2019S, p.R1441C/G/H, p.N1437H, p.Y1699C, and, p.I2020T. Of these, the p.R1441G mutation is particularly frequent, as it represents a founder mutation in the Basque population where it is responsible for 46% of all familial PD. Very rarely, this mutation has also been observed in other populations where it arose on a different haplotype. LRRK2 p.Gly2019Ser mutation accounts for about 0.5% simplex cases and >5% familial cases in various ethnic groups worldwide. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies have identified common polymorphisms in LRRK2 that associate with idiopathic PD, implicating LRRK2 function in susceptibility to late-onset PD in individuals without pathogenic mutations.||LRRK2 mutations cause PD with age-related penetrance and clinical features identical to late-onset sporadic PD. Biochemical studies support an increase in Lrrk2 kinase activity and a decrease in GTPase activity for kinase domain and Roc-COR mutations, respectively. Strong evidence exists that Lrrk2 toxicity is kinase dependent, leading to extensive efforts to identify selective and brain-permeable Lrrk2 kinase inhibitors for clinical development. Lrrk2 kinase inhibition is currently one of the most prevailing disease-modifying therapeutic strategies for PD. Thus, Lrrk2 kinase inhibitors are in development as potential Parkinson's disease therapeutics.||Furthermore, there is now evidence showing that LRRK2 expression and phosphorylation levels have a potential as markers of Parkinson's disease. Recently, the presence of Lrrk2 was confirmed in exosomes from human biofluids, including urine and cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, elevated LRRK2 autophosphorylation was identified in brain-derived and peripheral exosomes in LRRK2-mutation carriers. In summary, it has been shown that markers of Lrrk2 activity and function may be detected in human blood and that they are relevant for pathogenesis if PD.||Thus, the biochemical analyses of human blood from LRRK2 positive participants and LRRK2 negative participants create a strong base for the development of PD-related biomarkers. This biomarker may in turn be even more accessible than genetic testing and it may serve for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of PD.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT00315250,"Two hundred patients who have undergone neurological evaluation by their general community neurologist and have a questionable diagnosis of PD will be recruited to participate in this study.

NCT04653584,"Domperidone is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist with antiemetic properties. Domperidone does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing its used in PD. Domperidone may prolong the duration of the QT interval in predisposed patients, and has been associated with proarrhythmia and arrhythmic deaths. Arrhythmias, sudden death and cardiac arrest were reported with high intravenous doses which has led to withdraw of the parenteral form of the drug in 1984. More recently, two case control studies found an increased risk of sudden death associated with domperidone use. In these reports, the increased risk was depending on age, dose, and the use of domperidone in combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Following the discussion created by this alert, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued recommendations restricting domperidone use to patients younger than 60 years at doses below 30 mg/day and for a short period (7 days).||Because there is no alternative antiemetic drug to be used in PD, domperidone is commonly prescribed as a preventive therapy in most PD patients initiating DRT since more than 30 years. In this population, usually older than 60 years, doses of 60 or 80 mg/day are commonly prescribed, for at least 2 months of the DRT escalating dose period or longer. A particular ""niche"" of domperidone misuse might be patients treated with continuous subcutaneous administration of apomorphine, a second line therapy in PD, inducing severe and prolonged nausea in almost all patients. Little is known about the use of domperidone in PD in France in clinical practice, but misuse of domperidone in PD patients is probably very high. Data collected from two French PD cohorts, COPARK and DIGPD, showed that 8-14% of PD patients were treated with domperidone, extrapolating 10,000 to 20,000 potentially exposed patients at particularly high risk of sudden death.||The aim of this proposal is to conduct a cross sectional observational study of domperidone prescription in PD patients consecutively recruited by neurologists both in University hospitals (24 PD expert centers, thanks to NS-Park/FCRIN network), general hospitals and private neurologists. This will provide insights about the current prescription of domperidone, their doses and duration, the PD patients' profiles, and the different indications for which it is prescribed.||This project will allow describing the use and misuse of domperidone in the PD population in France. This prospective study will take advantage of the recently released national database for PD, supported by the French Plan for Neurodegenerative Disease and by the French Network for Parkinson's disease and Movement Disorders (NS-Park/FCRIN network). This study will help to set up a tool and standardized operating procedures that can be used for subsequent similar studies on clinical practice in neurodegenerative diseases through a large network of academic and private specialists. This information will help Regulatory Authorities to communicate about the safety profile of the drug. Finally, our results obtained in the French population will be compared to those from the European Union countries using domperidone and from which data has been published.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT03953222,"After validation of the proposed wearable real-time feedback (WRTF) system, the feasibility of utilizing this system to provide RTF of gait and posture parameters will be tested in a single group of twenty-six people with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease (PD). The sample size was chosen to observe an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC (2,1)) value between 0.75 and 0.9 at alpha = 0.05 and power of 80%. Subjects of all races and both genders will be recruited. Despite higher representation of males in PD, the investigators will seek to achieve an equal distribution of males and females. As the incidence of PD increases with age, rising after the age of 55 years with a sharp increase after 60 years, the investigators will recruit participants between the ages of 50-80 years.||After enrollment, each subject will participate in one screening and clinical evaluation session at Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center (MAPC) at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center (SJHMC) in Phoenix, AZ and all the experimental data collection sessions will be performed at the Arizona State University (ASU), Tempe, AZ. The 3 experimental data collection sessions will be (1) Validity Session, (2) Continuous feedback (CF) Mode Session, and (3) On-demand feedback (ODF) Mode session. All the screening, clinical evaluation, experimental data collection sessions will be carried out during subject's ""medication-on"" state (when the medication best controls symptoms of PD, usually 60-90 minutes after the subjects' usual dose of anti-parkinsonian medication). The order of CF and ODF mode sessions will be randomized across the subjects.||Screening and Clinical Evaluation Session (~ 2 hours): In this session, first the subjects will be screened by Dr. Shill for the eligibility criteria which includes UPDRS evaluation. If they are eligible, their balance and cognitive status will be evaluated using the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest) and the Scales for Outcomes of Parkinson' Disease-Cognition (SCOPA-Cog) respectively. The Mini-BESTest has been shown to detect even subtle balance deficits in people with PD. SCOPA-Cog is a PD-specific scale that tests non-verbal and verbal memory, learning, attention, and executive function, including complex motor planning, working memory, and verbal fluency and has undergone extensive clinimetric testing.||WRTF Concurrent Validity Session (SA1) (~ 2 hours): In this session, MIMU sensors will be placed on the lower legs, wrists, lower back, and upper back. Lightweight reflective markers will be placed according to the full-body marker setup (Vicon Motion Systems, Ltd, UK) and specialized software (Nexus 2.3, Vicon) will be used for kinematic assessment. Participants will be asked to complete twenty 15-meter overground walking trials at their self-selected comfortable speed. From the steady state segments of these trials, the gait events, spatio-temporal gait indices (including step length, step time, arm swing, and back angle) will be calculated in real-time for each step using the WRTF system (as described in earlier sections), and will be compared against the gold standard values obtained from Vicon system.||Continuous Feedback Mode Session (SA2) (~ 3 hours): In this session, RTF will be provided for the participant to practice walking with increased step length, arm swing, upright posture and regular step time. All the walking trials will be performed overground and feedback of only one parameter will be provided at a given time/trial. Various step-to-step spatio-temporal gait and posture measures will be obtained using the WRTF system.||First, the participants will be asked to walk at their self-selected speed for one 80-meter trial (with a 180 degree turn at 40-meter) in a long hallway to determine their baseline gait measures (including step length, arm swing, step time, and back angle). Then, the subjects will perform one 80-meter trial stepping on visual cues - strips placed on the floor at equal intervals, to obtain the step length target template (described in the 'Continuous Feedback Mode' section). Next, the subjects will be asked to walk two 80-meter trials during which they will be provided with RTF of their step length performance (their current movements in a sound form and specific instructions through conducting ear phones). Following this, participants will perform one 80-meter trial following a metronome to obtain the step time target template which will be followed by two 80-meter trials during which RTF of their step time will be provided to improve gait rhythmicity. Similarly, the trials for arm swing and upright posture will be performed as follows: one 80-meter trial (walking with bigger arm swings) to obtain the arm swing target template, two 80-meter trials providing RTF of arm swing performance, one 80-meter trial (walking upright) to obtain the uprightness target template, and two 80-meter trials providing RTF of upright posture.||On-Demand Feedback Mode Session (SA3) (~ 3 hours): This session will evaluate the use of on-demand feedback. After wearing the sensors of the WRTF system and ear phones, the subjects will perform one baseline 100-meter trial without feedback at their self-selected comfortable speed. Then, the subjects will participate in eight 100-meter trials with a 180 degree turn at 50-meters, of which, two trials will be performed with each type of feedback (step length, step time, arm swing, or upright posture). Spatio-temporal gait indices will be calculated from non-feedback and feedback trials. Sufficient rest periods will be provided between the trials.||Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures: The main primary outcomes will be intra-class correlation (ICC) and reliability coefficients (RC) to test the validity of the WRTF system. The other primary measures will be step length and time and their variability, arm swing, and upright posture. Also, correlations between cognitive status and balance control and ability to follow RTF will be explored.||Data and Statistical Analyses: For gait, mean values of step/stride length, asymmetry, variability in step length and time, gait speed, swing time, double support duration, and gait related items of clinical scores will be calculated. The posture control measures will include back angle during walking trials and time duration of maintaining different balance tasks during Mini-BESTest evaluation. Concurrent (criterion-related) validity between the two systems (WRTF vs. Vicon) will be analyzed with ICC (2,1) and RC. The effect of RTF (CF and ODF) on each primary measure will be assessed using paired t-tests. The difference in the degree of improvements between CF and ODF modes will also be compared by the application of paired t-test on the changes in gait and posture measures between respective feedback trials and baseline trials.

NCT02164162,"In Parkinson's disease, gait disturbances represent one of the most disabling motor symptoms, frequently associated with an increased risk of falls, loss of independence and a negative impact on quality of life. Patients with Parkinson's Disease, display an abnormal gait pattern (reduced gait speed, shortened stride length, and a longer double-limb support phase) and they are typically unable to generate a proper stride length and to maintain a steady gait rhythm. Therefore, improving gait ability is a primary goal of physical therapy in patients with Parkinson's Disease. Conventional Physiotherapy aimed at enabling patients to maintain their maximum level of activity and independence is often prescribed, but treatments for gait give only limited benefits. Promising reports have suggested that external sensory cueing (acoustic, visual, verbal cues), through an attention mechanism, may help to increase the deficient internal cueing in Parkinson's Disease, thus improving gait pattern.Treadmill training, which induces a constant horizontal movement, generates a rhythmic input for locomotion, coordinating the upper and lower limbs, offering a useful retraining modality that complements conventional therapy. In the last decade some researchers focused on the use of partial body weight support systems on the ground or with the combination of treadmill training (Body weight support-treadmill). These systems, which improves the ability to stand in an upright position with a redistribution of forces on the trunk, thus disengaging the girdle and upper limbs, suggests a greater improvement in motor performance and walking ability compared with conventional phisiotherapy. In recent years, the interest in automated robotic devices for gait training for Parkinson's Disease patients has grown. With their consistent, symmetrical lower-limb trajectories, robotic devices provide many of the proprioceptive inputs that may increase cortical activation and improve motor function while minimizing the intervention of a therapist. Moreover, proprioceptive inputs may share mechanisms that are common to external cues, thus stimulating the cerebellar-premotor pathway to improve gait. Besides,the preprogrammed walking pattern corresponds to normal gait kinematics including: gait cycle timing, inter-limb and inter-joint coordination, appropriate limb loading, and afferent signaling. A recent randomized controlled trial that compared a comprehensive rehabilitative program vis-à-vis robot-assisted gait training has shown that the latter displays some advantages. A pilot, non-controlled study explored the effect of robot-assisted gait training on freezing of gait.Still, despite recent interest in automated locomotion training, there is still very little evidence to support the superiority of this technique over traditional gait training. A computerized gait analysis represents an useful aid to study gait disturbances. The analysis sets objectives and defines quantitative data about gait changes occurred in a patient, in relation to the progression of underlying disease or th effectiveness of treatments administered (medication, surgery or physical). So the main aim of this study will be to analyze, through a clinical and an instrumental evaluation, the effectiveness of a Lokomat gait training in subjects affected by Parkinson's disease in comparison to a ground conventional gait training",Parkinson’s Disease

This use of the device (TENS unit) is investigational. While it has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of pain, it has not been approved for the treatment of freezing.

NCT01423565,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for neurological and psychiatric disorders, being one of the most important therapies in functional neurosurgery to date. Class I evidence shows that subthalamic nucleus stimulation (STN) for Parkinson's disease (PD) is more effective than the best medical therapy (1,2). Globus pallidus internus stimulation for primary dystonia has an improvement rate of up to 70%(4) and is considered the main surgical treatment for this pathology. Symptom improvement in essential tremor is well documented. Pain, epilepsy, psychiatric disorders such as Tourette syndrome, obsessive - compulsive disorder and depression are promising applications of DBS. Obesity, memory improvement, aggressiveness, drug addiction, minimal conscious state and hypertension are areas of continuing investigation as potential applications of DBS.||The clinical effects of DBS result from the delivery of electrical charge to brain tissue. The way this electrical charge is delivered depends on the electronics of implantable pulse generators (IPGs). IPGs apply pulses of electrical stimulation in which voltage or current increases from zero to a maximum value for a period of time (order of tens of microseconds) and then returns to zero.||There are two types IPGs , differing on whether voltage or electrical current is controlled (3).||Constant - voltage IPGs: in this type of IPG there is control over the maximum voltage associated with each pulse. The maximum current will vary depending on the impedance. A specific voltage is programmed. The amount of electrical current delivered with a constant voltage depends on the impedance of the tissue and the electrodes. Thus, the voltage will not indicate how much electrical current is given; the resistance will determine this parameter.|Constant - current IPGs: provide a specific electrical current and will automatically adjust the voltage depending on the impedance. The strength of stimulation will remain the same regardless of changes in the impedance. The difference in impedances on each electrode and the intersubject variability in impedances will not alter the electrical current by modifying the voltage.||Until fairly recently, only constant voltage IPG's have been available for use. A newer generation of IPG's have been available for more than a year that can provide either constant voltage or constant current according to physician and patient preference. There is no evidence yet to support the preferential use of one modality over the other.||IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY Following DBS electrode implantation, the impedances within the same patient can vary widely. Surgical implantation changes tissue impedance, being usually higher immediately after surgery. In this case the patient will require higher electrical currents. After the initial tissue reaction subsides, the reduction of impedance will generate an increase of the charge density. For this reason it is commonplace to wait at least 2 weeks after electrode implantation before programming the IPG.||Furthermore, different contacts on the same DBS lead can have widely varying impedances. Effects or side effects associated with stimulation of one electrode contact often cannot be applied to a different contact on the same DBS lead in the same patient because the impedances may differ.||The range of impedances that can be measured will depend on the choice of voltage. In some patients, the voltage used therapeutically may not be enough to allow an accurate measure of the impedances, causing confusion regarding the structural and electrical integrity of the IPG.||For all the above mentioned factors, the clinical results in patients with constant - voltage IPGs will depend on the experience of the operator to deal with the different aspects related to tissue and electrode impedances to achieve the desired current. The electronic properties of constant - current IPGs allows the system to make voltage adjustments in order to maintain the desired current and the subsequent clinical effect. This has been the theoretical background for the development of constant current IPG's; whether or not this theory is true in practice is the subject of this study.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT02953665,"This single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will enroll 57 participants with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD. Subjects enrolled in the study will be randomized to receive once daily self-administered injections of liraglutide (1.2 or 1.8 mg, as tolerated) or placebo at the same dose range in a 2:1 study design.||Liraglutide has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat adults with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and to treat obesity, but it is considered investigational in this study, as it has not been approved for use in patients with PD. Liraglutide belongs to a class of medications able to stimulate receptors of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a naturally occurring peptide found throughout much of the brain and able to increase the incretin effect in patients with T2D, stimulating the release of insulin. Liraglutide can reduce systemic and brain insulin resistance, an abnormality that could help drive PD pathogenesis. Indeed, impaired insulin signaling in the brain can cause or exacerbate many brain pathologies and behavioral abnormalities seen in PD. Another GLP-1 agonist, named exenatide, has been evaluated in patients with PD, showing significant improvement of motor and cognitive symptoms. There is reason to believe that liraglutide may prove superior to exenatide in treating PD.||Eligible participants will be followed for up to 14 months and will be expected to complete 9 in-person visits and 2 telephone visits. The study will measure liraglutide effects on motor (assessed by changes in the MDS-UPDRS part III) and non-motor symptoms of PD (assessed by the NMSS and MDRS-2) after 52 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcomes include measures of the association between liraglutide's effects on peripheral insulin resistance, PD symptoms and safety. Collection of blood and urine samples will be obtained to monitor drug safety.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT03582137,"Persons with PD have progressive disabling tremor, slowness, stiffness, balance impairment, cognitive deficits, psychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, fatigue and insomnia. Tremor may interfere with necessary daily and work functions. The disorder affects approximately seven million people globally. The total economic cost in the US is around 23 billion dollars. In addition to economic costs, PD reduces quality of life of those affected and their caregivers.||Cognitive impairment is a common feature and ranges from delayed recall in early stages to global dementia in up to 80% at end stage. PD with dementia has been associated with reduced quality of life, shortened survival, and increased caregiver distress. Community-based studies have estimated the point prevalence for dementia in PD to be 28% and 44%.||Depression, anxiety and psychosis are also common and are particularly disabling in PD, even at the earliest stages. These symptoms have important consequences for quality of life and daily functioning, are associated with increased carer burden and risk for nursing home admission. Anxiety affects up to 40% of patients with PD, and may predate motor symptoms by several years. The most common anxiety disorders in PD are panic attacks (often during off-periods), generalized anxiety disorder, and simple and social phobias. Psychotic symptoms vary in frequency according to the definition used. If mild forms are included, these affect up to 50% of patients. Visual hallucinations are the most common type. However, hallucinations occur in all sensory domains and delusions of various types are also relatively common. The impact of psychosis is substantial in that it is associated with dementia, depression, earlier mortality, greater caregiver strain, and nursing home placement. Thus, it is crucial to treat these symptoms in order to optimize the management of PD patients.||Generally, however, current therapies are inadequate. Medications have improved the prognosis of PD, but also have problematic adverse effects.||Since treatment of PD is often unsatisfactory and since cannabis has recently become legal and readily available in Colorado, persons with PD have been trying it. Patients have heard from the internet, support groups and other sources that marijuana is helpful. Most are doing so on their own, without the supervision or even knowledge of their neurologist. In a survey conducted in the spring of 2014 in University of Colorado Hospital Movement Disorders clinic about 5% of 207 PD patients, average age 69, reported using cannabis. In another study Katerina Venderova and colleagues reported that 25% of PD patients had taken cannabis in the General University Hospital in Prague. In the investigators clinics, about 30% of the PD patients have asked doctors during their clinic visits over the past 6 months about cannabis. In an anonymous web-based survey, 72% PD patients reported current or past using medical cannabis, and 48% reducing prescription medication since beginning cannabis use.||PD mostly affects the elderly, and affected persons often have cognitive, psychiatric and motor problems, such as being prone to falling. Cannabis is well documented to cause psychosis, anxiety, slowness and incoordination. Studies have also shown that chronic users have structural and functional Central Nervous System (CNS) alterations. Thus cannabis is expected to be risky in persons with PD. Further, there are many components of cannabis, and the cannabis preparations being sold in Colorado vary widely in composition. There are no definitive data regarding the benefits and risks in of these various preparations in PD. Studies on safety and efficacy are greatly needed to protect this fragile Colorado population.||Human trials report that CBD decreases anxiety and causes sedation in healthy individuals, decreases psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia and PD, and improves motor and non-motor symptoms and alleviates levodopa-induced dyskinesia in PD. Given the current literature regarding CBD: possible neuroprotective effect, good tolerability, anxiolytic and antipsychotic effects and general lack of information in PD, including its effect on tremor, the investigators feel that it is important to study its use in PD further. The investigators hypothesized that it would reduce tremor, anxiety and psychosis, and would be well tolerated in PD.||The Specific Aims are:||Primary Specific Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of CBD on motor symptoms in PD, specifically on the motor section of the Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).||Secondary Specific Aim: To assess the safety and tolerability of CBD in PD, and to examine the effect of CBD on severity & duration of intractable tremor, night-time sleep, rigidity, emotional dyscontrol, anxiety and pain in PD.||Exploratory Analyses:||To study the efficacy of CBD on cognition, psychosis, sleep, daytime sleepiness, mood, fatigue, impulsivity, bladder function, other motor and non-motor PD signs, restless legs syndrome and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder and quality of life.||The study is a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind parallel design with two treatment arms, each of approximately 2-3 weeks duration.

NCT03131817,"Depression, anxiety and impulse control disorders are among the most prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) that greatly impact patients' and caregivers' quality of life. However, the neural correlate underlying these symptoms is still largely unknown preventing the development of comprehensive treatment for these symptoms.||The aims of this study are to 1) Determine the neural correlates of non-motor symptoms, 2) Determine how cortical stimulation can reduce these symptoms and normalize the abnormal brain signals, 3) Develop closed-loop stimulation paradigms and 4) Teach patients how to voluntarily modulate the abnormal brain signals.||Ten PD patients undergoing deep brain surgery (DBS) implantation and diagnosed with mild to moderate mood disorder and/or impulsive behavior will be enrolled in this study. In addition to the standard therapeutic DBS electrode used to treat motor symptoms, a flexible electrode will be placed over the prefrontal cortex. Both electrodes will be attached to the Medtronic Activa PC+S pulse generator (and Medtronic Summit RC+S pulse generator as replacements), investigational devices that allows therapeutic stimulation and chronic brain recordings. At multiple time points, up to 2 years post-implantation, in our clinic or patient's home, brain signals will be recorded while patients are resting or performing emotion/cognition tasks. Symptoms will be assessed using validated questionnaires and tasks to allow identification of neurophysiological correlates of non-motor symptoms. There is also an optional sleep study included for better understanding of the brain's physiology. The investigators will then investigate the effect of cortical stimulation on both symptoms severity and brain signals that may be related to symptom expression. These signals will then be used to implement closed-loop controlled cortical stimulation and neuro-feedback controlled strategies.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT02731170,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms.||Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) is the standard treatment for the motor symptom of PD, however DRT does not reduce axial PD symptoms such as freezing of gait, postural instability and balance disturbances. Further, long-term DRT could negatively impact on cognitive and motivational functions and leads to different motor and behavioural side effects. Therefore, the pharmacological approach becomes less effective in the moderate and advanced stages of disease.||The investigators testing the hypothesis that this approach is effectiveness also in moderate and advanced stages of disease In according with Hoehn and Yahr scale (H&Y) we identified 353 parkinsonian patients on stage 3, 79 subjects on stage 4 and 7 subjects on stage 5.||Clinical scores were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks by neurologists and physiotherapists expert in movement disorders.

NCT00833690,"Background & Rationale:||Convergent epidemiological and clinical observations have identified urate - a major antioxidant and the end product of purine metabolism in humans - as the first molecular predictor of both the risk and the progression of typical Parkinson's disease (PD). Among some 1600 early PD patients enrolled in prior clinical trials, those with baseline serum urate levels in the highest quintile (i.e., in the upper normal range) displayed a 40% slower rate of clinical (disability) progression compared to those with baseline urate at or below the median (with p<0.000001 for trend across quintiles). Similarly, amongst those who underwent serial SPECT brain scans for changes in dopamine transporter (DAT) binding, those with higher baseline serum urate levels displayed a slower rate of radiographic progression (loss of striatal DAT). Moreover, urate levels in baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples also correlate inversely with rates of clinical progression. Although this link between urate and a slower decline in PD appears reproducible and robust, the critical question of causality remains to be answered by a well-designed clinical trial. The biological plausibility of neuroprotection by urate strengthens the rationale for expedient pursuit of a trial. The availability of established pharmacological approaches to elevating urate makes such a trial feasible. In particular, inosine, an orally bioavailable, central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant purine precursor of urate, offers a practical strategy as it can readily elevate serum urate, has been widely consumed as a nutritional supplement, and has been administered chronically in several multi-year clinical trials for multiple sclerosis. Before embarking on a neuroprotection trial of inosine for PD, careful assessment of the safety, validity and methodology of this approach in PD patients is warranted.||Specific Aims:||The main goal of the study is to determine whether inosine is suitable for phase III evaluation of its ability to modify the rate of disability progression in PD. Specific primary aims entail the determination of the safety and tolerability of oral inosine, and its ability to elevate urate levels in serum or CSF; and the selection of an optimal dosing regimen. Secondary aims entail the further optimization of a possible phase III study design.||Methods:||A placebo-controlled double-blind dose-ranging randomized trial of inosine will be conducted in early PD. Ninety untreated subjects diagnosed with idiopathic PD and with a serum urate below the population mean (~6 mg/dL) will be enrolled at 17 North American sites and randomized to one of three treatment groups (n=30): 1) placebo, 2) inosine dosed to produce a mild elevation in serum urate, and 3) inosine dosed to produce a moderate elevation. Tolerability, validity (urate elevation), dosage and symptomatic efficacy will be assessed after 12 weeks of treatment. Contingent on adequate tolerability and validity as assessed in this short-term analysis, the study will continue for 2 years total duration with 2 groups (placebo and a merged single inosine dosing group) or the original 3 to assess long-term tolerability and safety, which will focus on main known risks of urolithiasis and gouty arthritis and the theoretical risk of cardiovascular disease.||Significance:||This study will determine whether a phase III trial of inosine as a potential neuroprotectant in PD is warranted. If it is, then the present study could shorten substantially the lead time, and through optimization of key design features would enhance the likelihood of its safety and success.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT04730466,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. This disease is characterized by motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. Non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment, anosmia, sleep disorders, or depression are also part of the disease, and although their prevalence is very high, they are often underdiagnosed.||One of the cognitive characteristics in PD is the slowness in the processing of information, which includes deficits in processing speed and attention, cognitive inflexibility, and forgetfulness. These symptoms may appear from the initial stages of the disease.||Approximately 60% of PD patients fall once a year and 40% do so regularly. These falls may be correlated with the inability to achieve compensatory movements to regain balance when their center of gravity generally oscillates outside their limits of stability (LOS), which is reduced in this disease. Some authors point out that reaction times and processing speed may be a marker of postural instability since a reduced speed is associated with difficulty in making turns. This is in line with Pantall's findings, indicating that cognitive function and postural control normally progressively worsen with disease progression.||The relationship between cognitive impairment and postural instability in PD patients may be specific for tasks that assess the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and its frontal-subcortical connections. The main cognitive functions whose affectation would influence a worse balance and gait performance would be attention and executive functions. Varalta et al specified that balance is related to executive functions and attention, while functional mobility is more related to cognitive impairment, verbal fluency, and attentional capacity.||Some authors point out that within the executive functions the component with the greatest weight in this relationship would be the inhibitory control. Dual-task performance has also been established as a good indicator of falls in patients with early-stage PD and no previous history of falls. The studies that carried out a one and a half years follow-up of the participants concluded that the deterioration of executive functions acts as a predictor of future falls in patients with PD.||Cognitive rehabilitation through neurorehabilitation platforms and neuropsychological rehabilitation in patients with Parkinson's disease has shown to be effective in improving processing speed, attention, and executive functions.||Although the relationship between cognitive deficits and postural stability seems to be demonstrated we have not found studies that, through cognitive rehabilitation, seek a stability improvement.||Our working hypothesis is that the group that receives rehabilitation of the speed of information processing and sustained attention will improve their postural stability compared to the group that does not undergo any therapy.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT03175107,"The application of tasks in virtual reality and computer games for motoric exercise in patients with neurologic impairment is already quite widespread. It allows controlled workout and flexible gradation of difficulty of the task, which is essential for rehabilitation.

NCT00556764,"General Design and Methods The overall goal of this proposal is to validate ANAM-PD as an assessment tool for cognitive status in PD. We propose a comprehensive strategy to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of ANAM-PD in detecting cognitive changes in patients with a diagnosis of PD (n=50) and healthy controls (n=25). The specific testing domains of the ANAM-PD battery will be validated against standardized neuropsychological testing, described in detail below. The reliability of the ANAM-PD battery will be evaluated through a test-retest procedure in a subset of 50 subjects (25 PD and 25 HC). This strategy will enable us to evaluate the individual domains of the ANAM-PD computerized cognitive test and establish a battery as a standard test to efficiently measure cognitive changes in PD. We also propose to explore functional neuroimaging of the cholinergic system using [123I] IBVM and SPECT, a marker of vesicular acetylcholine transporter and a measure of the integrity of the cholinergic neuronal system. Identifying and validating ANAM-PD as an efficient tool for assessing cognitive changes in PD and exploring the cholinergic transporter system in PD through functional neuroimaging could predict sub-sets of PD patients 'at risk' for developing dementia and help elucidate the neurochemistry related to cognitive decline in PD",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT03263793,"Deterioration of speech and swallowing is a hallmark of Parkinson Disease (PD). There is emerging evidence that choral singing benefits people with PD across a range of modalities. Despite the increasing popularity of ""Parkinson's choirs"", rigorous study of these benefits is lacking. There is a large body of evidence that intense vocal training improves speech and communication for people with PD. However, the intense training places high demands on clinical and patient resources and, due to its individualized approach, lacks the potential psycho-social benefits of a group intervention.||It is hypothesized singing training program will increase vocal loudness, range of articulation, and prosodic variation during speech. Additionally, given existing evidence for neuroplastic transference of voice-related interventions to swallowing function, laryngeal components of swallowing function will also improve post-intervention.

NCT03716674,"BACKGROUND||Basal Ganglia dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease (PD) induces gait impairment such as shorter stride length, reduced gait speed, reduced arm swing and an increased randomness in stride duration variability of gait cycles. This increased randomness in gait variability is a typical symptom which can lead to falls, autonomy loss and reduced quality of life. Recently, the Long-Range Autocorrelations (LRA) assessment allowed to emphasize the deterioration of the temporal organization of PD patients' gait variability and demonstrated correlations with disease severity and balance status. These LRA involve a long-memory process which means that every stride depends on the duration of the previous near and far strides. Gait variability should be balanced and should stay in an optimal framework between randomness and over-regularity. This means that LRA should be balanced to keep the healthy adaptive capabilities of the system, to be in the ""Optimal Movement Variability"" which allows the person to move in a stable but still adaptive way. LRA measurement would therefore be the first quantitative biomarker of gait instability and risk of falling, which is of particular clinical interest.||It is now well known that PD patients have a greater gait variability with a decrease of the LRA. That means that PD patients are more likely to fall which lowers the quality of life. It is also well known that gait disorders do not respond well to dopaminergic pharmacological treatments. Therefore, it seems important to develop non-pharmacological treatments to improve LRA. Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS), by mean of a metronome, has been studied for years to improve PD patients' gait. Authors showed that the use of a fixed-tempo isochronic RAS reduced the stride duration variability, acting like an external rhythm generator and bypassing the basal ganglia that act like an impaired internal rhythm generator in PD patients. It is then suggested that a broader use of a isochronic RAS, by the mean of a metronome, should be beneficial in gait rehabilitation for PD patients' gait parameters, such as gait speed, stride length, stride duration variability and quality of life.||However, it has been demonstrated that the use of a isochronic RAS decreases LRA in healthy persons and also PD patient. Authors suggested that the cognitive load required by a isochronic RAS would be too elevated for PD patients, creating a dual tasking and diminishing its applicability in a cueing device. This RAS would compel patients to a stereotyped gait instead of an adaptive autocorrelated gait. Then the question is: Should clinicians continue to use an isochronic RAS by the mean of a metronome for PD patients' gait rehabilitation ? Or should clinicians use autocorrelated RAS to avoid loss of adaptivity but still get the beneficial effects of the metronome ? The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of 3 different RAS (isochronic metronome, autocorrelated metronome and random metronome) on PD patients' gait parameters and stride duration variability (magnitude and temporal organization).||METHODS||Patients||This study was unicentric. Nine PD patients participated in the study and were recruited from the department of Neurology of Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc (Brussels, Belgium). The study was approved by the local ethics committee. All patients gave informed written consent to the study. Eligibility criteria will be described in another section.||Procedure||Patients were asked to walk around 4 times (1 time for each condition presented below) on an oval indoor track of 42 m during 10 minutes each time to get 512 consecutive strides necessary to measure the LRA. The indoor track was chosen in order to collect data in a standardized way and to avoid bias linked to environmental conditions that could potentially affect patients' balance, such as terrain and/or weather conditions. Two unidimensional accelerometers were taped on patients' both lateral malleoli in the antero-posterior direction. These accelerometers were connected to a recording device (Vitaport 3 - Temec Instruments B.V., Kerkrade, The Netherlands) attached to the patients' waist. This system allowed to record at 512 Hz each positive acceleration peak that correspond to each heel strike. The peak of acceleration, detected by the software internally developed, determined the stride duration.||Four conditions were presented to patients in a randomized order. One condition consisted on walking without any RAS (Spontaneous Condition, SC). The three other conditions were respectively the Isochronic tempo RAS Condition (IC), the Random RAS Condition (RC) and the Autocorrelated RAS Condition (AC). Each of these three conditions consisted in walking with slight RAS which differ by their temporal organization. Each of them were composed with the software Matlab 2014R (Mathworks, M.A.) and adapted to each patient according to spontaneous gait speed determined by a 10m Walk Test achieved before the experiment. Consequently the IC, RC and AC respectively contained no RAS variation, random variation of the RAS and autocorrelated RAS organized in time and characterized by a Hurst (H) exponent = 0.80. To resume, even if these three RAS had the same mean of the interbeat duration, RAS differ from each other by the presence or the absence of rhythm variations (different H and alpha exponents). During the experiment, patients were listening to the RAS through earphones (Apple EarPods) by the mean of a MP3 player.||Before data collection, patients listened to the RAS and were asked to mark the rhythm with a finger tapping to see if the temporal structure of the RAS was accurately detected. After this, patients were asked to ""walk accordingly to the proposed rhythm"". A minimum of 10 minutes is necessary to get 512 consecutive gait cycles (number required for the application of the signal processing methods detailed below). The heading direction taken by the patients (clockwise or counterclockwise) was randomized between them but each patient kept the same heading direction after randomization. The experiment was always performed at the same time of the day for the same patient during ON phase of dopaminergic treatment to avoid drug effect. Furthermore, a maximum of two conditions were tested during one day with a minimum break of 5 minutes between each of the conditions to avoid a fatigue effect. Patients returned a second day to perform the other 2 conditions.||Functional assessment||Functional assessments covered the 3 domains of International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) : body functions and structures, activity and participation. Assessments will be described in another section.||Gait assessment||Data were extracted from 512 consecutive gait cycles which is required to measure gait variability.||Spatiotemporal gait variables||Mean gait speed, gait cadence and stride length were measured as follow:||Mean gait speed (m.s-1) = Total walking distance (m)/ Acquisition duration (s)|Gait cadence (#steps.min-1) = Total number of steps (#)/Acquisition duration (min)|Step length (m) = Gait speed (m/s)*60/Gait cadence (steps/min)||Stride duration variability||Stride duration variability can be assessed 2 ways: in terms of magnitude or in terms of organization (how stride duration evolves across consecutive gait cycles).||Magnitude of the stride duration variability:||To determine the effect of the RAS on the magnitude of the stride duration variability during 512 gait cycles, the mean, the standard deviation (SD) and the coefficient of variation (CV = [SD/mean] * 100) were assessed.||Temporal organization of the stride duration variability (LRA):||Three methods (Rescaled Range Analysis (Hurst exponent; H), Power Spectral Density (α exponent) and d relationship (d = H- [(1+ α)/2])) and the ""surrogate data tests"" were used to measure LRA. The presence of LRA can be shown with a high level of proof when these 3 conditions are met:||H is greater than 0.5|α is significantly different from 0 and less than 1|d ≤ 0.10 If an inconsistency appears between H and α, the Randomly Shuffled Surrogate Data Test is applied in order to reject null hypothesis of an absence of temporal structure in studied series.||Data were treated by the mean of CVI Labwindows (C++).||Statistical analysis:||Statistical analyses were conducted using SigmaPlot 13.0. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was applied to determine the presence or absence of effect of the various RAS on spatiotemporal gait parameters (gait speed, gait cadence, stride length) and on stride duration variability (linear measures (mean, SD, CV) and nonlinear measures (H exponent and α)). Another one-way repeated measures ANOVA was applied to analyze the variability of the inter-beat duration of the RAS (linear and nonlinear measures). When a significant difference between groups was detected with the ANOVA, a post hoc Tukey Test was performed to compare each mean with the other means to isolate the groups from each other. Spearman's correlation coefficient was measured to analyze the link between the nonlinear measures (H, α) of the stride duration and the inter-beat duration of the RAS. The results were considered statistically different for p-values < 0.05.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT03353688,"Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) can be remarkable for treating symptoms of Parkinson's disease, improvement varies across clinical trials, individual patients, and over time. A major limitation to the advancement of DBS therapy is that there are no established biomarkers to tailor stimulator settings in individuals. Emerging segmented (""directional"") lead technology allows current steering, a new opportunity to improve tolerability and efficacy by shaping the DBS electrical field. This novel lead design has 8 contacts rather than the 4 available with currently available leads. How do the investigators optimally adjust stimulation parameters when there are far more potentially useful settings than can be practically evaluated in clinic? How do the investigators know that DBS settings in a given patient are optimal or appropriate? The investigators have pioneered minimally invasive, rapidly acquired biomarkers to solve these important problems. Using electrocorticography, electroencephalography, and subcortical local field potentials, the investigators will measure whether resting or stimulus-evoked electrophysiology can serve as a predictive biomarker to guide activation and adjustment of a directional DBS system. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind crossover study is to measure the clinical efficacy of directional versus omnidirectional stimulation and to explore whether electrophysiology biomarkers can rapidly predict effective, well-tolerated contacts for directional DBS therapy.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT03974529,"There is growing volume of evidences support the positive effect of exercise and physical therapy to Parkinson's disease. Various exercise types have shown different positive effects. Gait training for 4 weeks showed a moderate improvement in balancing while balance training of 8 to 26 weeks decreased fall rate. Cued exercise would mildly increase the speed of the gait. Complementary exercises, such as Tai Chi and dancing, have shown improvement in balancing of the patients.||One of the main complaints of Parkinson's disease is rigidity. It is because of the musculoskeletal impairments which compromise the flexibility and stability of both axial structure (spine) and the extremities. Truncal stiffness and rigidity results in a stooped posture, which further undermines one's balance and agility. Flexibility training (stretching) is shown to be beneficial to all stages of patients with Parkinson's disease, in terms of improved both range of movement in joints and spinal stability. It is recommended that regular stretching should be the first step in one's exercise program to combat the muscle rigidity. High quality clinical trial and meta-analysis have demonstrated short term, and to a lesser extent, long term benefits in various outcome measures. To achieve positive effects, supervised progressive strength and aerobic endurance training program of 12 weeks was required. Extended progressive strength training improved muscle strength for up to 24 months. While aerobic endurance training would increase walking capacity up to 16 months.||There are data suggested a threshold of intensity of exercise to be reached for the positive effect. This overall body of evidence suggests that regular vigorous exercise should be accorded a central place in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.||In this study, the investigators are to investigate the effect of regular vigorous aerobic exercise training of running on motor and non-motor symptoms, and quality-of-life of people with Parkinson's disease.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT00044590,"While many pathophysiologic pathways may be involved in the neurodegeneration responsible for PD, genetic factors are likely to determine a general susceptibility to neurodegeneration. There are a number of genetic polymorphisms of genes such as those coding for the cytochrome p450 super-family of genes referred to as 'susceptibility genes'. However, they are generally not sufficient to cause disease unless a person encounters exposure to an environmental toxin: the disease is caused by a gene-environment interaction. Thus, it is imperative to assess genetic susceptibility in individuals exposed to a toxin. We will test the gene-environment interaction hypothesis by conducting an epidemiologic population-based case-control study of newly diagnosed PD patients from three rural California counties: Kern, Fresno, and Tulare. Over a four year period, we expect to collect 400 cases referred to us by local neurologists, farm worker clinics, and Parkinson's foundations. For each case, one population control will be selected at random from residential parcel maps and Medicare databases and, in addition, one unaffected sibling control and - when possible - affected siblings to avoid potential biases and inefficiencies inherent in the use of each type of control. For each study subject, an environmental and occupational pesticide exposure estimate will be derived using California pesticide-use reporting (PUR) data and information about pesticide application on crops in combination with crop patterns shown in satellite images and aerial photographs; in addition, extensive exposure interviews will be conducted with all study subjects. In a three-tiered approach to examine the effects of gene-environment interactions we will: 1) test for association (and linkage) of PD to selected loci associated with PD in earlier studies using multiallelic repeat markers and genotyping; 2) test for association using intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 50 candidate genes arrayed to create ""the PD array""; and 3) use future technical possibilities to screen for genome wide associations using array technology to scan 5,000-10,000 SNPs throughout the genome.

NCT02488395,"This project aims at better understanding the physiopathology of Parkinson's disease and the effect of the administration of the classical medical treatment. The main aim of this project is to evaluate the possibility of an early detection using a new original strategy. The investigators want to demonstrate the predictive value of the superior colliculus light responses as an early biomarker.||The investigators will perform functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI) to measure the BOLD light responses of the superior colliculus at different key stages of the normal medical follow up of Parkinson's patients by the neurologist (when diagnosed, when introducing the first treatment and when the treatment is stabilised).||Two groups of participants will be tested: a) a group of de novo patients, which have just been diagnosed and haven't started their treatment; b) a group of matching controls.||A first fMRI session (S1) will be performed to compare the light induced BOLD response of the superior colliculus between de novo patients and their matching controls.

NCT03866044,"BACKGROUND Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multi-system neurodegenerative disease affecting a subset of vulnerable cells in various brain structures, including brain stem nuclei. Selective degeneration of dopamine (DA) producing neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNc) is a key neuropathological feature in PD and gives rise to the classical motor symptoms which can be symptomatically treated by dopamine replacement therapy. Yet the link between DA and PD extends far beyond the motor system, pertaining to core aspects of cognition that are supported by dopamine signalling: For instance, there is converging evidence that reward computations and motivational drive are significantly affected by PD and its dopaminergic treatment. Noradrenaline (NA) producing cells of the pontine nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) are also affected in PD with early and severe degeneration. Although the LC is the main source of NA in the brain, and NA has been shown to be an important neuromodulator, it is unclear how neurodegeneration of the LC contributes to motor and non-motor symptoms in PD.||PD and the dopaminergic system Several midbrain nuclei contain cell groups that synthesize the neurotransmitter DA and project from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and SNc to cortical areas and the striatum. It has recently been suggested that VTA and SNc have distinct roles in reinforcement learning: dopamine bursts from VTA are thought to reinforce stimulus values, while the SNc is specifically important for action values. Since PD preferentially affects the ventral tier of the SNc leading to the motor symptoms, it has been hypothesized that dopaminergic treatment leads to an ""overdosing"" of the less impaired pathways from VTA to striatum.||PD and the noradrenergic system Parallel to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in SNc, noradrenergic neurons in the pontine locus coeruleus (LC) exhibit Lewy pathology and undergo a marked degeneration early on in PD which exceeds that of dopaminergic SNc neurons. The LC is the largest source of noradrenaline (NA) to the brain, and exerts neuromodulatory effects through extensive ascending projections to the entire cerebral cortex. The loss of NA neuromodulation associated with PD might contribute to both motor and non-motor symptoms and could potentially be a therapeutic target, however the effect and significance of NA deficiency in PD pathogenesis is to date not fully understood. The LC is thought to be involved in the modulation of attention and arousal and also in the processing of emotion. The role of LC neurodegeneration and the resulting decrease in noradrenaline levels to the pathophysiology of PD is not fully understood. However, a large number of studies in humans and animals support a double role of noradrenergic cell loss in PD; a contribution to motor- and non-motor symptoms as well as a facilitation of DA neurodegeneration.||AIMS The overall purpose of the study is to map structural and functional changes in the subcortical dopaminergic and noradrenergic networks that mediate cognition, attention and emotion in PD.||The study aims to:||Measure PD related neurodegeneration on 7T sMRI in ROIs corresponding to neuromodulatory brainstem nuclei: Substantia nigra pars compacta, nigrosome-1, ventral tegmental area & locus coeruleus|Predict disease severity by multivariate pattern of neurodegeneration measures in these areas.|Map the relationship between the autonomic arousal response to arousing stimuli, neural activity in the noradrenergic arousal network and the degree of neurodegeneration in noradrenergic brain regions.|Investigate the effects of neurodegeneration in the core dopaminergic nuclei (SNc and VTA) and dopaminergic medication on the midbrain striatal network mediating action-value and stimulus-value learning.||HYPOTHESES||Structural changes of SN and LC integrity:||Participants with PD will have significantly decreased signal on MTw-imaging in the SN and LC quantified as reduced contrast ratios in SN/cerebral peduncle and LC/pontine tegmentum.|SN and LC volumes, calculated as the sum of supra-threshold voxels in the regions of SN and LC, will be significantly decreased in participants with PD.|Accelerated iron accumulation in SN and nigrosome-1 will lead to an increased hypointensity of the SN and a loss of a distinct nigrosome-1 region on SWI, R2* and QSM.|R2* and QSM values in SN on Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping will be significantly higher in participants with PD.|Motor impairment (UPDRS-3 subscore) can be predicted by multivariate pattern analysis of MTw- and SWI-images of the SN.||Measures of LC structural integrity will correlate with non-motor symptoms, specifically apathy and depression.||Functional changes:||Participants with PD will have significantly decreased functional activation in a region corresponding to the LC when exposed to arousing stimuli.|Functional activation in the LC will correlate with LC structural integrity.|Autonomic arousal responses (pupil response and skin conductance response) will correlate with LC structural integrity and functional activation.|In healthy controls, there will be increased SN-dorsal striatal connectivity for action value learning, increased VTA-ventral striatal connectivity for stimulus value learning.|In PD patients off their medication, there will be reduced SN-dorsal striatal connectivity. This will impair action value learning while stimulus value learning will only be mildly affected.|Dopaminergic medication restores dopamine levels in the dorsal striatum and ""overdoses"" ventral striatum. Medication will restore (at least partially) SN-dorsal striatal connectivity and dorsal striatal activity which will lead to largely unimpaired action value learning. ""Overdosing"" will result in exaggerated VTA-ventral striatal connectivity and exaggerated ventral striatal activity. In subjects with strong ventral striatal ""overdosing"" inappropriate stimulus value learning might occur.||RESEARCH PLAN Part 1: 7T and 3T structural MRI to map structural changes in SN and LC and their clinical correlates in PD.||Participants: 60 patients with idiopathic PD (aged 18 or more), 20 age-matched healthy control subjects.||Ultra-high field MRI. All participants will be scanned using a research-only 7T Achieva MR System (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) located at Hvidovre Hospital. MR-scanning will be performed with a dual transmit, 32-channel receive head coil (Nova Medical Products), including a neuromelanin sensitive, magnetization transfer weighted (MTw) sequence at 0.4x0.4x1.0mm resolution, a susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) sequence at 0.4mm isotropic resolution and a multi-echo quantitative R2* sequence at 1.0mm isotropic resolution. Additionally, all participants will be scanned using a 3T Siemens Prisma MR system.||Additional examinations: Outside the scanner, motor and non-motor symptoms (UPDRS, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale & NMSS, Non-Motor Symptom Scale), cognition (MoCA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment), apathy (LARS, Lille Apathy Rating Scale), depression (BDI-II, Beck's Depression Inventory), impulse control disorders (QUIP, Parkinson's Disease Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders Questionnaire), impulsivity (BIS-11, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale), and handedness (EHI, Edinburgh Handedness Inventory) will be assessed.||Part 2: 7T fMRI to assess DA and NA dysfunction in PD Participants: A sub-group of individuals who participated in part 1 will be asked to participate in Part 2: It is expected that 20 patients and all the healthy participants are able to lie sufficiently still to cooperate in a fMRI experiment.||Participants will be scanned again with the 7T Achieva MR system using a reduced transverse field-of-view covering the SN and LC. Structural imaging will include a 1.0 mm isotropic T1w sequence for co-registration. High-spatial resolution functional Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) (fMRI) will be used to map the functional activations of SN and LC in two task-fMRI paradigms. For the assessment of NA activation, a paradigm utilizing auditory stimuli and visual stimuli with arousing content (IAPS, International Affective Picture System) will be administered in two separate sessions; first inside the scanner, and secondly outside the scanner, during which autonomic responses to the stimuli (pupil responses and skin conductance responses) are recorded. In the second paradigm, participants will be gambling on a virtual slot machine with two handle bars in two different colours where one of the handles can be pushed, the other pulled. Participants have MRI-compatible joysticks to pull or push the handles of the virtual slot machine. Depending on the block, the action performed (pulling or pushing the handles, irrespective of their colour) or the stimulus colour (yellow or blue, irrespective of whether they can be pushed or pulled) are predictive of reward and punishment (one option has a higher reward probability than the other, these have to be learnt via feedback). Reward probabilities are changing repeatedly and unannounced.||Patients will undergo the experiments twice on two separate days, on and off PD medication, in a randomized, balanced order. Healthy participants will also undergo the experiments on two separate days.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT02107638,"Annually, 60,000 people within the United States are diagnosed with PD.1 The cardinal features of PD include resting tremor, rigidity, asymmetric onset, and bradykinesia.2 These characteristics appear to affect balance. Balance is a complex system that involves maintaining posture, facilitating movement, and recovering equilibrium to control one's body within its limits of stability. Balance involves the coordination of vestibular, visual, auditory, motor, and high level premotor systems, many of which are compromised in PD.3 Previous research found that 46% of the PD subjects fell within a three month period, and that 21% of subjects had their first fall during the three month period.4 Postural instability is a hallmark sign of PD that compromises balance control and increases the risk of falling.5,6||Many falls in PD occur because of postural instability and their inability to organize sensory information. The SOT identifies abnormalities in postural control, somatosensory, visual, and vestibular sensory systems. It offers a composite score that is a percentage based on normal age controls. We recently presented an abstract at the World Parkinson's Conference in Montreal, Canada that showed individual's with PD (n=20) who were categorized as fallers, scored lower on the SOT than non-fallers with PD.7||The pathogenesis of PD is a progressive neurologic depletion of dopaminergic neurons from the basal ganglia which manifests as common motor or extrapyramidal signs: tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. As the severity of PD progresses there is frequently postural instability and further disability. There have been relatively few studies investigating the effect of OMM on PD patients. One previous research study demonstrated that a single session of osteopathic manipulative medicine protocol on 10 PD subjects improved gait compared to age-matched sham-controls, particularly stride length, cadence, and maximum velocities of upper and lower extremities.8 Other studies on non-PD subjects have shown that OMM can improve subject balance. In a pilot study 20 elderly subjects with OMM protocol applied weekly for four weeks showed an improvement in postural instability, as measured by changes in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway on force plate observations.9 OMM has also been shown to improve subjects with dizziness. The outcomes were measured using the SMART Balance Master©. It was found that the composite score on the SMART Balance Master© significantly improved immediately after intervention as well as one week later. (P<.001)10||OMM utilized in improving gait in PD patients addressed muscle hypertonicity and joint motion restrictions by using muscle energy and articulatory techniques for the spine and the extremities.8 OMM techniques that were used to address balance focused on removing muscle spasms and restrictions of the spine and cranium. Based on our experience of treating PD patients in our clinical practice and the improvement of symptoms in the forementioned studies we developed a PARK-OMM protocol to utilize in this study. The protocol starts with a CV4 technique, which helps to address cranial restrictions, and can potentially affect patient's autonomic function.11,12 The protocol then proceeds to address each major spinal region and the extremities by decreasing muscle hypertonicity and increasing joint range of motion with direct OMM articulatory and muscle energy techniques. These techniques were selected due to their document efficacy in improving joint mobility in the general population as well as in PD both in clinical practice and documented prior studies.13||Hypothesis: OMM treatments twice a week over a 6-week period on PD subjects using a defined OMM protocol will produce a prolonged improvement in motor function measured by the Movement Disorders Society's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and balance measured by the NeurCom SMART Balance Master© Sensory Organization Test (SOT) leading to a reduced number of falls. We are also going to screen for serum biomarker changes to investigate the potential effects of OMM. We expect that the OMM cohort will have significantly improved motor function scores, balance, and an associated decrease in falls. This would help to establish the role of OMM in the treatment of PD. Positive findings may also lead to additional studies investigating how OMM impacts the quality of life in PD patients. It could also promote further investigation on the potential mechanisms of OMM amongst the PD population.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT02760108,"One person in every 500 has Parkinson's and around 127,000 people are living with the condition in the UK. Unfortunately, it is a progressive disease that has no cure. Many treatments are available that can improve or maintain someone's quality of life, but the investigators would like to develop treatments that can be used much earlier in the disease process. These could slow down the disease or prevent it from progressing further.||For most people who develop Parkinson's there is no clear underlying cause. However, the investigators are particularly interested in the minority of people diagnosed with Parkinson's who have either early onset disease and/or other relatives affected with Parkinson's. The investigators believe that variations in inherited material (genes) can sometimes cause the disease, and this may run in families. This opens the door to a range of studies on the effects of gene variation at a nerve cell and brain level, which the investigators hope will lead to new targeted treatments.||It is already known that some rare gene variants can cause Parkinson's. Some of these are inherited in what is called an 'autosomal dominant' way i.e. each child of a person with this type of gene change has a 50% chance of inheriting it. However, it is also known that not everyone who carries the change will go on to develop the disease. Some people appear to be protected against developing the disease and the investigators would like to understand this better. Other variants, particularly important in early onset Parkinson's are ""recessive"", and in this form of inheritance there is a very low risk to parents and children.||The investigators are looking closely at the genetic makeup of people with Parkinson's in comparison with unaffected people and in comparison to unaffected and affected family members in order to find out more about which gene changes can cause Parkinson's.||Following the identification of genetic variation that causes Parkinson's, in collaboration with the NHS and other researchers, the investigators plan to: 1) develop new NHS tests of Parkinson's and 2) develop new disease model which can act as a testbed for new treatments",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT02930512,"Studies show that patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) have an increased risk of fracture, particularly hip fracture whose complications and postoperative mortality appear to be higher than in the general population.||This increased risk of fracture is due partly to an increased risk of falling, and secondly to an impairment of bone tissue with lower bone mineral density (BMD). A meta-analysis concluded that patients with IPD have lower BMD than healthy controls. Prospective studies also showed rapid bone loss in these patients compared with controls. The association between low BMD and IPD seems dependent on the severity and duration of the disease even if some data are contradictory. Various mechanisms may explain this bone loss including weight loss, malnutrition and a low level of physical activity. However, enrollments in these studies are often weak and it is difficult to conclude on the real impact of these factors on bone loss in the IPD. The main objective of our study is to assess and prioritize from these various bone loss mechanisms. Bone assessment by ""peripheral quantitative computed tomography"" (pQCT) will also assess the impact of various risk factors on bone strength parameters.

Although the stooped posture is a typical feature, more severe spinal misalignment (and deformities) can affect people with PD. These postural deformities include Pisa syndrome (PS), camptocormia (CP), antecollis (AC), scoliosis (S) and striatal deformities related to hand (striatal hand) and/or toes (striatal toes). The prevalence of these postural deformities is variable because several diagnostic criteria have been used to characterize each deformity.

Conventional physical therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) has traditionally avoided fatigue and high intensity workouts. Yet, in PD controlled studies have shown that: (i) an acute aerobic stress produces endogenous dopamine immediately after the exercise and (ii) short term (a few weeks) high intensity aerobic training enhances D2 striatal receptor density and cortical excitability and clinically improves walking, upper limb and executive functions; (iii) long-term (six months) high intensity aerobic treadmill training is associated with less deterioration of subjective UPDRS III score compared to a waiting list.

NCT04180865,"Rationale:||Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms, including cognitive decline. Mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is already present at time of diagnosis in 24-36% of PD patients. Cognitive impairment in PD is associated with both cholinergic and dopaminergic deficiencies in the brain. Although dopaminergic neuronal degeneration is quite well established in relationship to the motor impairment, the rate and extent of the cholinergic neuronal degeneration in the course of PD is unknown. It is also unclear how cholinergic and dopaminergic degeneration contributes to cognitive deficits found in early and more advanced PD and its role in the progression over time.||Objectives:||The primary objective is to establish the relationship between cognitive impairment and cholinergic neurodegeneration in de novo PD patients, by studying cholinergic imaging using [ 18 F]Fluoroethoxy-Benzovesamicol ([18F]FEOBV) positron emission tomography (PET) and neuropsychological performance over time.||Secondary objectives include: (1) the investigation of possible predictive factors using optical coherence tomography and (2) to determine the relative contributions of PD diagnosis and dopaminergic medication use to the changes in microbiota composition observed in PD patients.||Study design:||At baseline patients will undergo the following investigations and questionnaires: Demographics, detailed medical history, neuropsychological assessment, imaging including MRI brain, dopaminergic Fluoro-18-L-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) and cholinergic FEOBV PET, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and microbiota composition.

NCT04349865,"Pharmaceutical companies with LRRK2 kinase inhibitor programs are close to Phase 1 clinical testing. Phase II proof-of-concept clinical trials will need to be conducted in LRRK2 manifesting mutation carriers. This is currently a challenging task given the limited availability of this cohort.||While the LRRK2 G2019S mutation is the most common mutation present in Caucasians and certain ethic groups, the G2385R variant has been identified as a risk factor for sporadic PD in the Asian population (Chinese Han, Japanese and Korean). In fact, in these populations, the occurrence of this mutation is thought to be higher than (up to 4% of PD patients) the occurrence of the G2019S mutation in the Caucasian population. In contrast to G2019S, this variant has not been fully characterized. For example, there has been controversy regarding its kinase activity with some reporting higher and others lower activity. A systematic biochemical characterization of the G2385R is necessary to determine if this cohort may be useful in LRRK2 kinase inhibitor trials.||Although there were significant studies on the clinical characterization of LRRK2 risk variant carriers with or without PD, little is known which factor is more specific in predicting the conversion to PD and which biomarker can be used to measure the disease progression. Identifying these clinical phenotype and biomarkers will be critical for studying pharmaceuticals effective for PD.||Several lines of evidence point to a role of LRRK2 in the immune system. Particularly high LRRK2 expression has been discovered in macrophagic and monocytic cells, but not T-cells, leading to speculation of a functional role for LRRK2 in the innate immune system. LRRK2 is also expressed in toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)-activated microglia, brain-resident macrophage cells that have been implicated in the pathology of PD brain, and LRRK2 modulates proinflammatory responses in these cells via several immune signaling pathways. Moreover, enhanced neuroinflammation may contribute to neurodegeneration in PD patients carrying LRRK2 mutations. Further, recent genome-wide association studies highlight LRRK2 in the modification of susceptibility to the chronic autoimmune Crohn's disease and Mycobacterium leprae infection, raising the possibility that LRRK2 may contribute to PD through immunogenic mechanisms. Although neuroinflammation as a primary trigger or secondary process linked to PD remains unclear, the link between LRRK2 and the immune system provides an intriguing possibility for a potential pathogenic mechanism as well as aid in the identification of potential markers of LRRK2-related immune function that could inform therapeutic development and/or act as potential pharmacodynamic measures of LRRK2 activity.||This study will take advantage of the larger cohorts of LRRK2 G2385R variant carriers with or without PD established by the Chinese Parkinson Study Group in China.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT04694872,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a degenerative process that affects the basal ganglia, primarily substantia nigra, and other brainstem pigmented neurons, and its main clinical symptoms are resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural reflex disorder (1). These movement symptoms usually occur unilaterally and gradually affect the other side of the body. Gait disorders are quite common in patients with Parkinson's, and the most common disabilities during walking are reduced arm swing, step length, speed, step width, and postural control inadequacy (2). One of the characteristic movement disorders in PD is hypokinesia, in which there is a decrease in motion amplitude and speed. Hypokinesia can occur during movements such as walking, speaking, and writing. When individuals with PD try to perform or coordinate two motor tasks simultaneously, hypokinesia can occur during complex actions (3). Different exercise approaches, including musculoskeletal exercises, aerobic exercises, Nordic walking, repetitive task training, sensory cues, and balance exercises have been proposed for the treatment of movement disorders and gait in these patients (4). The LSVT BIG protocol, which consists of large-amplitude exercises for movement disorders, has been used in treatment in recent years (5). High-intensity motion amplitude training in PD was firstly implemented in the form of LSVT LOUD to improve hypophonia. The newly developed LSVT BIG treatment, derived from LSVT LOUD, aims to restore the normal range of motion by re-adjusting the patient's perception of movement and walking. Treatment focuses on intense exercise of large amplitude movements. The LSVT BIG exercise intensity was determined as 16 individualized 1-hour sessions, 4 times a week for 4 weeks. Each exercise is repeated at least 8 times and is performed with an effort of 80%, with rest breaks minimized as much as possible (6). LSVT BIG training consists of maximal daily exercises, functional component tasks, BIG walking and hierarchy tasks. The aim of the training is to readjust movement during all functional tasks in the clinic and to encourage the transfer of the newly acquired motion amplitude to all non-clinical tasks. As needed, the therapist provides visual and verbal feedback to increase the amplitude of the movement. The maximum daily exercises consist of 7 versatile standard exercises performed while sitting and standing. In the functional component tasks section, it performs 5 tasks selected according to patient goals and therapists' evaluation, these tasks are performed over and over again, focusing on increasing the amplitude of motion in each session. The BIG focuses on the patient stride length and the increasing amplitude of arm swing, and the distance is determined by walking speed and endurance. In the hierarchy tasks section, the therapist designs the functional task record form based on the patient's notification, a set of movements created based on the patient's notification, and hierarchical tasks are developed in accordance with the determined functional goals. Hierarchical tasks can be advanced by increasing the complexity of the environment. In addition, the patient is instructed to apply the acquired skills in the home environment in order to maintain the principles of this education in daily life activities (7). Although LSVT BIG treatment has been shown to have positive effects on walking speed and goal-oriented activities, its effects on freezing, balance, bed mobility and transfers during walking have not yet been specified (6). Although research on the efficacy of LSVT BIG treatment is limited, the European Physiotherapy PD Guideline recommends this exercise approach to improve walking, balance, transfers and physical capacity (8). In this guide, it is seen that exercise programs that include functional activities related to balance have an important place in the rehabilitation of PD. However, there are limited studies comparing the effectiveness of exercise types and exercise methods that can provide normal range of motion with similar intensity (9). Lack of dose-response relationships in LSVT-BIG treatment, access to the clinical environment of patients for 16 sessions and four weeks, and limitations on practical applicability of the treatment were emphasized (10). The determined standard protocol imposes a significant temporal and economic burden for outpatients (11). For this reason, it is thought that performing LSVT BIG treatment via video conferencing method and remote exercise monitoring with tele-rehabilitation, will increase the participation of patients. The implementation of remote rehabilitation interventions through telerehabilitation or communication technology is used in individuals with PD as a means of overcoming barriers and increasing compliance in many patient populations with good results. It has been shown that participation in telerehabilitation and walking exercises is higher in this population than in face-to-face exercises (12). In addition, it is stated that reduced physical exercise and increased psychological stress in the Covid 19 pandemic can worsen the symptoms of PD, and it is more important than ever to encourage home-based, adequate dose exercises. During this period, remote follow-up of individuals with PD is more reliable; It is clearly seen that online exercise, dance lessons or web-based applications for patients stand out (13). The aim of our study is to compare the effects of telerehabilitation-based LSVT-BIG protocol and telerehabilitation-based functional balance and mobility exercises in Parkinson's patients.||It is planned to include 50 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD) with a level of 1-3 according to the Hoehn-Yahr scale, who applied to the Neurology Clinic of Bakırköy Psychiatric and Neurological Diseases Hospital between August 2020 and September 2021.

NCT01380899,"Parkinsonism, the syndrome, is a common movement disorder, and Parkinson's disease, the most common cause of parkinsonism, is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease.||The clinical diagnosis of PD is based on the presence of the four common features: tremor when the limb is at rest, resistance to passive movement of the joints (rigidity), slowness and paucity of movement (bradykinesia and akinesia) and postural abnormalities.||Approximately 25 percent of patients who received an initial clinical diagnosis of PD are found to have parkinsonism as part of another disorder, such as one of the so-called Parkinsonism-Plus Syndromes (PPS) The number and complexity of PPS seem to be increasing. This, along with the lack of diagnostic tests, makes it difficult for the clinician to distinguish between disease types.||Some characteristic clinical features are used for the differential diagnosis, this manifestations include early and severe postural instability, falls in the first year of onset, abnormal eye movements, autonomic dysfunction, cerebellar signs and upper motor neuron signs. The PPS respond poorly to antiparkinsonian medications and have a worse prognosis than does PD. In spite of these suggestive features, not all PD patients have the same progression, in some cases it is impossible to separate typical PD from PPS, especially at the early stage. In this context, biological markers must be of great usefulness for the differential diagnosis of these entities.||Some reports have described early features of PD such as (SPECT) imaging of the dopamine transporter that demonstrated the reduction of dopamine transporter in the striatum body at the early stage of PD and degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve at the beginning of the disease process of PD; this occurs before neuronal cell loss is present in the dorsal vagal nucleus; This fact accounts for reduced cardiac uptake of meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a physiological analog of norepinephrine. However, these diagnostic methods are not often performed. Therefore, more sensitive methods are needed to help improve the accuracy of diagnosis of PD.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT03421899,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that is increasingly prevalent with age, with the incidence rising from approximately 4 people per 10,000 in their forties to 2 in 100 over the age of eighty. Besides motor symptoms, such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, PD patients often experience a variety of non-motor symptoms, such as fatigue, depression, sleep disturbance, and dementia.||Although symptomatic treatments exist to partially compensate for motor dysfunction, no neuroprotective treatment has yet been established to slow PD progression, which inevitably renders patients incapable of living independently. Compared to age- and sex-matched controls, PD patients are about 5 times more likely to require nursing home care and this care costs about 5 times more than average nursing home care. This, combined with the European demographic shift toward an increasingly larger fraction of aged individuals, creates a social and economic challenge to develop new medications to slow the progression of PD.||Our understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of PD has rapidly developed in the past two decades, but this has not yet translated into any clinically established neuroprotective treatment that slows disease progression. There is a growing consensus that the failure of previous efforts is mainly due to the aetiopathogenic diversity of PD and the estrangement of existing preclinical models from clinical PD. For example, it is known that mutations in mitochondrial genes can cause monogenic PD and biochemical evidence indicates that in a proportion of cases, idiopathic PD is associated with detectable mitochondrial dysfunction.||Therefore, the investigators focus is on monogenic forms of PD that involve mitochondrial abnormalities as a primary (e.g., Parkin, PINK1), or secondary (e.g., LRRK2, GBA1) phenomenon, in order to extrapolate to idiopathic PD (IPD) patients with and without mitochondrial dysfunction (Mito-IPD and Amito-IPD, respectively). Biochemical pathways focusing on, but not restricted to mitochondrial function, will be assessed using a variety of techniques including biochemical assays on blood, urine, CSF and tissue samples. The investigators will explore both the relevance and measurement of specific biochemical pathways in Parkinson's and related disorders||The main overall objective is to stratify PD patients based on dysfunction in biochemical pathways related to PD.

NCT03968133,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex condition that carries a high burden of neuropsychiatric comorbidities. About a third of individuals living with Parkinson's disease have one or more anxiety disorders, resulting in lower quality of life, greater care dependency, and increased caregiver burden. Gastrointestinal dysfunction is very common in Parkinson's. Constipation is experienced by the vast majority of patients and often manifests years before onset of motor symptoms, symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome are also commonly found in PD. Increased intestinal permeability has been demonstrated in PD. Impaired intestinal barrier function can lead to chronic systemic low-grade inflammation, which has been strongly associated with mood disorders. Several lines of evidence suggest a link between the gut microbiome and Parkinson's disease.||The microbiome has been linked to anxiety both in human and animal studies. Several studies have found beneficial effects of probiotics on mood disorders in non-PD populations, including stress and depressive behaviour in animal models, and sad mood reactivity and major depressive disorder in humans. Specifically regarding anxiety, probiotics have shown benefits in several animal models; human probiotic trials have demonstrated improvements in psychological distress and anxiety in healthy controls, in mothers experiencing postpartum depression and anxiety and in individuals afflicted with IBS-related anxiety without PD.||In summary, given the high rate of anxiety in PD, the growing evidence that probiotics may improve anxiety and mood disorders in non-PD populations, and the strong links between the gut microbiome and PD, we will carry out a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study into the use of a multi-strain probiotic to improve anxiety and Parkinson's disease.||Recruitment: Approximately 72 participants will be randomized to either the probiotic intervention arm or placebo treatment.

Using functional imaging it has also been shown that the grafted DA neurons can restore striatal DA release and provide a sustained re-activation of motor cortical areas, i.e. key areas that were underactive prior to grafting.||Post-mortem studies have shown excellent long-term survival of the grafted DA neurons, notwithstanding the observation that some of the long-term surviving transplants (at 12-15 years after grafting) have now been shown to contain signs of PD-related pathologies, i.e. neuronal Lewy-bodies and alpha-synuclein positive inclusions in the grafts. However, such changes have been observed only in some and not in all patients and when seen the extent of the pathology is limited to a small number of the grafted DA cells and the clinical consequence, if any, not known.||However, the outcomes of two NIH sponsored double blind placebo controlled trials, which published their main findings in 2001 and 2003, have raised major concerns. In both these trials the grafted patients did not show any significant improvement overall compared to sham-operated controls at 1 and 2 years post grafting. Furthermore, a significant number of patients in both trials developed GIDs, which in some cases were so severe that further neurosurgery was needed to remedy the situation.||The reasons for the variable, and overall poor, outcome in these trials, including the generation of GIDs, have been the subject of much debate but have recently centred on three key elements, with an additional possible fourth element:||The selection of patients in terms of clinical phenotype, disease stage and pattern of striatal dopaminergic denervation at the time of grafting;|The differences in immunosuppressive regimes and the risk that incomplete immunosuppression in combination with the use of solid graft methods may lead to the development of detrimental immune/inflammatory reactions at the graft site with compromise of the grafted dopamine cell function;|The mode of engraftment and differences in graft cell survival, and the risk for inhomogeneous delivery of dopaminergic neurons and the generation of potentially dyskinesia-inducing ""patchy"" innervations in the host striatum;|A final possible element is the composition of the grafted tissue and the ratio of serotoninergic to dopaminergic neurons within the graft. There is emerging evidence that serotoninergic neurons can release dopamine in a relatively unregulated fashion given they lack transporters for it, and as such may use L-dopa as a false transmitter which may not only underlie the development of L-dopa induced dyskinesia's but may also contribute to GIDs.||Failure of the NIH trials to demonstrate any overall clinical benefits in the grafted patients, and the unexpected and worrisome development of GIDs in a significant number of patients in these trials has represented a major hurdle for the future development of cell based therapies for PD and it is in this and related areas that this project seeks to move the field forward and go beyond the current state of the art for this treatment approach.||This project has gathered together all the available expertise in this area to resolve or reduce the risk of the previous complications seen with VM transplants in patients with PD. We will conduct a new round of clinical trials, involving a step-by-step optimisation of all technical aspects of the grafting procedure and patient selection and assessment, in order to improve clinical efficiency and consistency, in the absence of troublesome dyskinesia's.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT02869945,"Parkinson's disease onset is clinically defined as the appearance of motor symptoms including akinesia, tremor and hypertonia. Several studies have shown that motor symptoms occur when at least 50 % of dopaminergic neurons are lost. However, there are evidence suggesting that the level of dopaminergic denervation is not homogenous at the time of diagnosis. Some patients have a higher level of dopaminergic loss at disease onset indicating the existence of compensation mechanisms.||The aim of this study is to decipher how the metabolism of dopamine is involved in this compensation with a focus on the polymorphism of the COMT gene. This gene is expressed according to two variants: (i) COMT H that encodes a form of the enzyme with a high level of aactivity and (ii) COMT L that encode a form of the enzyme with a low level of activity. Thus, there are 3 possible genotypes in the population: (i) COMT HH associated with an increased degradation of dopamine, (ii) COMT LL associated with a decreased degradation of dopamine and (iii) COMT HH (intermediary between COMT HH and COMT LL).||The hypothesis is that this polymorphism of the COMT gene may participate to compensation mechanisms in early PD. Patients with COMT HH genotype may have an earlier motor symptoms onset than patients with COMT LL genotype.||To test this hypothesis, 51 patients with de novo PD will be included (17 patients for each genotype). Given the distribution of COMT polymorphism in the population, a maximum sample of 76 patients will be screened for inclusion of 17 patients for each genotype.||Only untreated patients will be included in the study in order to have a reliable assessment of motor severity without interference of dopaminergic drugs.||The study will be scheduled as follow:||At the first visit (V1), inclusion criteria will be checked and patients will sign the informed consent. COMT genotype of selected patients will be analyzed.|Result of COMT genotype will be obtained within 4 weeks. Only the 17 first patients with each genotype will continue the study|For these patients, an evaluation visit with clinical assessment including MDS-UPDRS, Non Motor Symptoms Scale, segmental symptoms scale, Montreal Cognitive assessment, MMSE, Frontal assessment battery and Parkinson's disease behavioral assessment scale (ECMP) will be performed..||All the patients will have a monophotonic emission tomography with I-123-Ioflupane in order to assess the level of dopaminergic denervation. An MRI scan with resting state study will also be performed to assess the compensation mechanisms at the networks level. Cerebrospinal fluid sampling will be optional and will allow direct measurements of dopamine metabolites.||The main outcome measure will be the level of dopaminergic denervation on I-123-Ioflupane scans according to COMT genotype with and without adjustment for age, gender and severity of motor symptoms on the MDS-UPDRS part 3.||Secondary outcome measures will include:||level of dopaminergic denervation compared across the 3 genotypes (COMT HH, COMT HL and COMT HH) with and without adjustment for age, gender and motor scores|determination of functional compensation at the networks scale assessed on fMRI resting state scan according to dopaminergic denervation|determination of CSF dopamine metabolite profile at the time of diagnosis (CSF sampling will be optional).||If this hypothesis is confirmed, this will allow to test the efficacy of COMT inhibitors in order to delay dopaminergic drugs initiation for PD patients.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT00153972,"The study is designed to measure the difference of dopamine turnover rate measured by Fluoro-Dopa-PET in the putamen between patients with Parkinson's disease treated with cabergoline and levodopa for 3 months.||The hypothesis for this study is that the dopamine turnover rate is a more sensitive marker for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease compared to the standard Fluoro-Dopa-PET measuring only the Fluoro-Dopa uptake into the striatum. The specific aim of the study was to estimate normal ranges and test-retest measures for various parameters characterising dopamine metabolism from a prolonged 18F-dopa positron emission tomography (PET) measurement using a reference tissue model and compare their value for the detection of early PD.||For the interventional part of the study, the hypothesis is that levodopa has larger effects on striatal dopamine turnover compared to dopamine agonists by providing more dopamine precursor. Enhancement of compensatory mechanisms for dopamine loss in early PD such as increased dopamine turnover could have several beneficial implications such as improvement or prolongation of symptomatic treatment responses, but might also produce therapeutic problems such as the development of levodopa-induced motor complications. The specific aim is to evaluate the effects of levodopa and the dopamine D2 agonist cabergoline on striatal dopamine turnover estimated as the inverse of the effective dopamine distribution volume ratio (EDVR) measured by 18F-dopa PET in de-novo PD.||The study protocol includes an initial Fluoro-Dopa-PET scan before treatment and after three months double-blind treatment with cabergoline or levodopa.

NCT01052831,"Impulse control disorders (ICDs), including compulsive gambling, sexual behavior, buying, and eating, are increasingly recognized as a significant clinical problem in Parkinson's disease (PD), occurring in up to 15% of patients. Dopamine agonist (DA) treatment is thought to be the primary risk factor for the development of ICDs in PD. ICDs often lead to significant impairments in psychosocial functioning, interpersonal relationships, and quality of life. The management of ICDs in the context of PD can be complex. Patients may be reluctant to discontinue DA treatment due to the motor benefits derived from treatment, so patients often have chronic symptoms. Thus, additional treatment approaches are needed.||A medication shown to be efficacious for the treatment of ICDs with minimal impact on parkinsonism would allow many ICD patients to continue on full-dose DA treatment. Naltrexone, a long-acting opioid receptor antagonist, helps in the treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence. In addition, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that it helps in the treatment of pathological gambling in the general population. Opioids regulate dopamine pathways in areas of the brain linked with impulse control disorders, and opioid antagonists block opioid receptors in these regions. In this study, 48 PD patients with an ICD will be treated either with naltrexone (50-100 mg/day) or placebo for a period of 8 weeks. The study will assess if naltrexone improves ICD symptoms in PD and is well tolerated.

NCT04467632,"Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder touching 1.5% of the general population over 60 year-old and featuring impaired mobility with high impact on daily living and quality of life of the patients and their caregivers. Fourty percent of the patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) report inconstant, prominent, spontaneous, transitory improvement in mobility occurring on morning awakening, before taking their first morning dose of dopaminergic medications. This apparently unpredictable, highly variable, sleep-related phenomenon has been named ""Sleep Benefit"" (SB) by the scientists.||SB is a promising track to follow to develop novel therapeutic strategies for motor symptoms in PD. An innovative approach could be to induce modifications of mobility by influencing sleep regulation in PD patients in experimental settings.||Sleep propensity and timing depend on the coordinated interaction of the duration of preceding wakefulness (homeostatic component) and on a circadian signal (circadian component). Reciprocal interactions between homeostatic and circadian processes preside to internal synchrony of many physiological processes. We hypothesize SB to depend on serendipitous optimal synchronization between circadian and homeostatic process on morning awakening. As SB shows high day-to-day, inter- and intra-subject variability, studying SB requires multiple, repeated assessment of mobility during several days. A home-based experimental setting would be optimal for this purpose in terms of cost-effectiveness and acceptability by the patients. Moreover, considering that the range and nature of SB has not been well characterized so far, and that the amplitude of its variability is unknown, a reliable, observer- and situation-independent, reproducible assessment method of SB is a pivotal requirement for further research in this area.||A recently developed technique associating machine-learning algorithms with wireless wearable sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) and software applications might be particularly promising to characterize the complexity and multiplicity of SB in PD. Thanks to this technique, repeated, multiple assessments of mobility can be performed at patients' home without the constant presence of an investigator.||The working hypothesis of this study is that motor performance in PD patients improves on morning awakening when optimal synchrony between circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep occurs. As first step, we envision to set up a home-based and technology-assisted methodology and to verify its scientific, technological and logistic feasibility.||The study will involve four work packages, for each of which specific endpoints are defined:||WP1: Definition of the logistics, setting, practices of the study procedures for home assessment;||WP2: Technological setup of:||IMU wearable sensors|SleepFit software application development|light therapy (included sham light therapy)|home polysomnography|chronobiological assessments (distal-proximal skin body temperature gradient; Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) from salivary specimens;||Two work packages (3 and 4) will require patients inclusion and interventions on patients:||WP3: Validation of mobility assessment by wearable sensors: accuracy of machine learning algorithm to predict patients' motor status based on the MDS-UPDRS-III total score and on the 3.14 item (global clinical impression of mobility);||WP4: Testing in real-life conditions at patients' home in a small group of subjects.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT01521117,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neuro-degenerative disease affecting about 2% of the adult population in the United States over the age of 65.

NCT03639064,"BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Pain is a common symptom in PD and is reported in up to 50 % of patients. Pain in PD has been classified as musculoskeletal, dystonic (particularly in OFF-periods), radicular and central pain, and is frequently associated with muscle rigidity, postural abnormalities and bradykinesia. Often, the presence of pain in PD is associated with the daily fluctuations in the motor symptoms of PD. In addition, some patients experience 'off-dystonia' which affects the toes and feet, with painful cramps and posturing. The treatment of pain in PD patients with such fluctuating symptoms involves optimizing the dose of levodopa or other dopaminergic drugs to treat the OFF periods. Frequently, the pain does not resolve on altering the PD medication and remains difficult to treat.||Cannabis Sativa (marijuana) and its major psychoactive constituent, delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol(Δ9THC) have been used for centuries to treat pain. The mechanism of action is likely mediated via cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in basal ganglia and spinal circuits. Because of these potential therapeutic properties, several synthetic and naturally occurring cannabinoid preparations have been manufactured. Cannabinoids have been demonstrated to alleviate allodynia or hyperalgesia in animal models of pain; the effect on pain modulation may be secondary to CB1 receptors in the amygdala, thalamus, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion. Several recent clinical studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of synthetic and naturally occurring cannabinoids in pain. Synthetic cannabinoids such as nabilone and nabiximols are now licensed as add-on therapy in multiple sclerosis and advanced cancer for relief of pain. A Canadian systematic review of randomized clinical trials of cannabinoids (cannabis, nabilone, dronabinol and nabiximols) for the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain (neuropathic pain, mixed chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia) concluded that cannabinoids are modestly effective. Other cannabinoids found in cannabis sativa include cannabidiol (CBD). CBD potentially lacks a psychoactive effect, and appears to act via non-CB receptor-mediated actions including ion channels and enzymes. Pre-clinical studies suggest anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-nausea, anti-emetic, anti-psychotic, anti-ischemic, anxiolytic, and anti-epileptiform actions. Thus, the advantage of CBD in PD is a potentially lesser risk of cognitive dysfunction and psychosis.||Currently, there is an oil preparation (CanniMed® Oil) in Canada, with the advantage of ease of administration. CanniMed® Oil is a mixed oil preparation that contains both Δ9THC and CBD, of varying proportions of Δ9THC (more psychoactive component) and CBD (18:0; 10:10; 1:20 respectively). Investigators of this study have experience in conducting trials using synthetic cannabinoids in movement disorders, including PD. Investigators have demonstrated tolerability, but limited efficacy, of short-term administration of clinically available oral tablet cannabinoids in idiopathic dystonia. More specifically in PD, investigators have assessed nabilone for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia with documented efficacy. Of interest to the current proposal, in this study, investigators also found an improvement in painful OFF-period limb dystonia in 2 out of 7 subjects. It is unknown if this effect is a specific analgesic effect or related with an anti-dystonia effect.||STUDY HYPOTHESIS Despite the major advances in understanding the pathophysiology of the endocannabinoid system, there are many unknowns in the use of cannabinoids for medical purposes. To date, clinical studies with cannabinoids in PD have been inconclusive and the use of cannabinoids remains controversial due to a lack of well-powered confirmatory clinical studies and obvious safety concerns. However, the known efficacy of cannabinoids in reducing pain suggests that PD-related pain may also be a reasonable target for cannabinoids. Combined with the potential rationale for reducing dystonia, we hypothesize that cannabinoids could reduce pain in PD, regardless of the PD-specific pain cause.||Primary Outcome||Safety:||Incidence and severity of adverse events|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)||Tolerability:||Ability to remain on assigned treatment|Withdrawal rates due to adverse events||Secondary Outcomes: Assess change from baseline in the King's Parkinson Disease Pain scale (KPPS).||Other Outcomes: Assess change from baseline in frequency and severity of pain, sleep, dystonia and PD motor symptoms, using the following measurement tools:||Visual Analogue Scale for Pain|MDS-UPDRS part III|UDysRS - Dystonia part 2 subscores|Clinical Global Impression of pain severity (severity and improvement)|Epworth Sleepiness Scale",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT02939534,"The role of the immune response in Parkinson's disease (PD) is controversial. Recent studies show that neurons can present MHC-I (major histocompatibility complex - class 1) molecules and therefore may be susceptible to an attack by immune cells. The investigators anticipate that the results of this study will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of immune mediated neuronal degeneration in PD. Initial results suggest that antigens are presented by neuronal MHC-I in PD, and that this could lead to T-cell mediated neuronal death. The most obvious antigen that could be differentially expressed in PD patients and controls would be alpha-synuclein (-syn): -syn oligomers appear in all Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites and are the hallmark of PD changes in the brain. This study will offer the opportunity to further characterize the immune mediated component of PD, and to continue elucidating the biology that underlies antigen presentation and T-cell cytolytic activity.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT01715727,"Currently there existed no specific diagnostic test of Parkinson's Disease. Accurate diagnosis is of great interest because of the reduction in health cost and disease co-morbidity, improvement in effective treatment course and avoidance of un-necessary intervention. Our preliminary result showed superior performance from diffusion kurtosis imaging, a new development in MRI since 2007, on the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease when compared to conventional diffusion MRI. The study proposes to validate the diagnostic value of diffusion kurtosis in major basal ganglia regions using a cross-sectional study and to assess the prognostic value through 3-year longitudinal follow-up. Furthermore, the iron content as well as global white matter involvement in both PD and PD plus syndrome patients will be assessed. The difference in MRI information between PD and PD plus syndrome patients will then be addressed in a comprehensive manner.||One hundred and twelve patients with Parkinson's Disease will be recruited in the first year and followed up for 3 years. Another 112 healthy controls will be included. This is to validate the diagnosis and assess the prognosis. Another 30 patients with Parkinson's Disease, 15 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and 15 patients with multiple system atrophy will be recruited in the 2nd year for differential diagnosis. The imaging protocol will include both diffusion tensor and diffusion kurtosis imaging. Susceptibility weighted imaging will be included for iron content estimation. The targeted anatomy will include regional changes in basal ganglia, midbrain as well as thalamus, and global white matter changes using tract based spatial statistics. The statistical analysis will use receiver operative characteristics to assess the diagnostic performance, Spearman's ranked correlation for correlation with disease severity and net reclassification improvement for differential diagnosis. The prognostic value will be determined by the decline rate and the quality of life.||The end points of the project are to differentiate patients of PD from PD plus syndrome, and to predict the clinical outcomes using diffusion MRI. Patent application will be filed in the first year.

NCT02267785,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), particularly of the executive function (EF) subtype, is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and transitions to dementia, increased fall risk, and poor quality of life. EF is a set of processes that include mental flexibility and attention that are needed to learn and optimize performance of complex cognitive and motor skills. Such skills include the ability to generalize task performance under different conditions (context processing) and to perform two tasks simultaneously termed dual-task (DT) performance. Deficits in EF lead to problems in daily functioning and loss of independence and create psychosocial and economic burdens on patients and caregivers and stakeholders including health care providers. There is currently no effective treatment in PD to address EF deficits. Our animal and clinical studies in PD demonstrate that skilled exercise facilitates neuroplasticity of the basal ganglia (BG), a brain region sub-serving EF and supports the hypothesis that exercise will reverse EF deficits in PD. Furthermore, recent studies in healthy aging support that skill-based exercise that specifically promotes motor skill fitness (MSF), compared with aerobic exercise that promotes cardiovascular fitness (CF), has a greater impact on EF and related BG circuits. The aim of this application is to compare and elucidate the effects of skill-based versus aerobic exercise versus control on MCI of the EF subtype in PD; we hypothesize that skill-based exercise will result in the greatest improvement in EF and lead to modification of underlying neural substrates.",Parkinson’s Disease

[123I]5-IA-85380 SPECT was applied in healthy volunteers (Fujita et al. 2002, Fujita et al. 2003, Ding et al. 2004, Mamede et al. 2004, Obrzut et al. 2005) and PD patients (Fukuyama et al. 2004, Bucerius et al. 2006, Fujita et al. 2006). These numerous previous studies proved that [123I]5-IA-85380 SPECT is a safe and effective method to visualize cerebral acetylcholine receptors.||We intend to correlate the density and distribution of cerebral acetylcholine receptors with the clinical parkinsonian cardinal symptoms tremor, hypokinesia and rigidity. The patients are out-patients who are treated by the Department of Neurology, Saarland University, D-66421 Homburg/Saar, Germany. The nuclear medicine measurement [123I]5-IA-85380 SPECT will be performed in the Department of Nuclear medicine of the University of Würzburg, D-97080 Würzburg, Germany.||This study should answer the following questions:||Does the density of acetylcholine receptors in putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus and pons correlate with the severity of the clinical symptoms hypokinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, postural tremor?|Do PD patients with the tremor dominant type, akinetic rigid type and equivalence type differ concerning their accumulation of 5-IA-85380 (=density of acetylcholine receptors) in the putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus and pons?||Study protocol:||This study will include 25 patients with Parkinson´s disease (PD), Hoehn and Yahr stage 1. 25 patients have to be included ,if a correlation coefficient r = 0.5, an error 1st order = 0.05 and an error 2nd order = 0.20 are assumed. In addition, the number of 25 patients was sufficient in previous studies to obtain significant results. Due to the stochastic risk of radiation-induced long-term side effects (for example neoplasms), which is higher in younger patients, the lower age limit of included patients is determined to 50 years. The upper age limit is 75 years, since vascular cerebral changes increase exponentially in the higher age. The antiparkinsonian medication - except anticholinergic medication - can be continued during the nuclear medicine examination because previous studies excluded any interference between antiparkinsonian medication - except anticholinergic medication - and 5-IA-85380 SPECT.||The severity of the clinical parkinsonian motor symptoms hypokinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and postural tremor are quantified by means of the motor part of the UPDRS (Unified Parkinson´s Disease Rating Scale). The UPDRS is measured in the ""Off""-state; ""Off""-state means that the medication was interrupted for at least twelve hours. Further the Mini Mental State-Test and DemTect are measured. Healthy controls are not included since there exist norm values in the literature (Fujita et al. 2002, Fujita et al. 2003, Ding et al. 2004, Mamede et al. 2004, Obrzut et al. 2005).||The tracer [123I]5-IA-85380 is produced in the laboratory of radiochemistry and radiopharmacy of the University of Würzburg at the day of examination. This laboratory has the official permission to produce radiotracers. After informed consent by the patient and thyroid gland blocking with perchlorate, the radioactively marked tracer [123I]5-IA-85380 (185 MBq) was given intravenously. Cerebral SPECT imaging was performed 2-3 hours after intravenous injection of the radioactive substance [123I]5-IA-85380. A triple-head gamma camera equipped with low-energy high-resolution collimators was used. Data was acquired in a 128 x 128 matrix covering 120 degrees per camera and head, 50 seconds per view. A total of 120 views was acquired.||Statistical analysis:||The correlation between density of acetylcholine receptors (= uptake of [123I]5-IA-85380) in different brain regions is correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms.

NCT03808675,"Parkinson's disease (PD) culminates in dementia, immobility, and death at a huge societal cost. Even early in the course, motor and cognitive dysfunction impairs instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Non-motor symptoms due to fatigue, mood, sleep, and autonomic disorders further reduce quality of life (QoL). DTI shows progressive decline in brain tissue integrity. Usual care of PD centers on medical and surgical treatments relieve motor symptoms, but these cause side effects and lose efficacy over time. Usual treatment for non motor manifestations with pharmaceuticals (e.g., antidepressants) is symptomatic and not specific for PD. Acetylcholine esterase inhibitors exert modest symptomatic benefits on dementia, but there is no approved treatment for mild cognitive impairment. Physical Therapy is usually prescribed in later stages when mobility impairment ensues. There is no approved standard exercise regimen for PD. There is no cure or disease modifying treatment. Thus, there is a critical need for treatments that provide broad spectrum of benefits and slow PD.||Preliminary research suggests that aerobic exercise has potential to meet this need. However, aerobic exercise is demanding and carries some risks. It is unknown if aerobic exercise is more beneficial than usual care in PD in long term due to gaps in the investigators knowledge about the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on brain tissue integrity, motor function, cognition, IADL, QoL, and disease progression. Limitations of current studies include short duration, small sample size, lack or inadequacy of controls, lack of outcome measures for cognition and IADL, and lack of biological markers to measure progression. The objective in this application is to fill the translational gap by determining the biological, clinical, and functional effects of long term aerobic exercise (LTAE) in PD.||The overall hypothesis is that LTAE improves brain tissue integrity and slows down PD. The FIRST AIM is to determine the effects of LTAE on clinical features and functional abilities in PD. The investigators' prior 6-month, uncontrolled trial showed preliminary evidence that aerobic exercise improves aspects of motor function, cognition, and QoL in PD, but long term outcomes and implication for functional abilities are unknown. The investigators hypothesize that LTAE will provide sustained improvement in motor function, cognition, and non-motor symptoms with translation of benefits to QoL and IADL. The investigators will test this with a one-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compares the effects of moderate aerobic exercise vs usual care. The investigators will use driving as the outcome for IADL. Driving represents an important symbol for independence, and depends on integrity of cognitive and motor systems. The SECOND AIM is to determine the mechanism of LTAE effects in PD. CRF reflects complex improvements in vascular, cardiac, and metabolic health from aerobic exercise. There is preliminary evidence that higher CRF is associated with better brain health and motor/cognitive function, and that aerobic exercise improves these outcomes. For example, the investigators' preliminary study showed improvement of microtissue integrity in the striatum and white matter on DTI, but it is unclear how these changes counteract PD progression over long term. The hypotheses are: 1) LTAE will improve brain tissue integrity as indexed by DTI, 2) LTAE effects on motor and cognitive function are mediated by changes in brain tissue integrity on DTI, and 3) physiological processes leading to improved CRF from AE are critical to the benefits on the brain tissue integrity and motor/cognitive function. The investigators will test these hypotheses determining the effects of LTAE on CRF and DTI, and the association between individual differences in training related changes in motor and cognitive function, DTI, and CRF.||In summary, the investigators' proposal leverages the diverse interdisciplinary team, strong preliminary data and past work, and unique infrastructure to determine if LTAE slows down neurodegeneration and clinical disability in PD.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT04434898,"Currently, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are diagnosed mainly by neurologists, based on clinical symptoms. However, there are no objective criteria available for their diagnosis. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often employed in conjunction with clinical judgement, the images are mostly used to eliminate other diseases, rather than to confirm the diagnosis. Other imaging methods, such as Position Emission Tomography or Computed Tomography, may help in the diagnosis of AD and PD, but have harmful effects on the human body.||Diffusion MRI, and in particular Diffusion Tensor Imaging, are often employed in the evaluation of changes in connectivity in the central nervous system. As it is non-invasive and does not involve radiation, diffusion MRI is suitable to be used for longitudinal studies. It has been used for the evaluation of fiber density and cross-section in many diseases, including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumours, with good results. Several measurements can be obtained from diffusion MRI, including fractional anisotropy and mean, radial and axial diffusivity. Changes observed in diffusion MRI are related to changes in water content inside and outside of cells, so an increase in the diffusion coefficient could reflect an increase in cell membrane permeability, which may be attributed to cell death and rupturing. A higher diffusion coefficient may be indicative of more neuronal death. Therefore, using diffusion kurtosis, the investigator may be able to improve diagnoses of PD.||From research on AD, the investigator found that the diffusion coefficient of patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD is significantly higher than control patients. The investigator will carry out analysis on 90 brain regions, including the fusiform gyrus, hippocampus, parahippocampus and cingulum. The listed regions have been observed to have differences in mean diffusivity for AD patients and those at risk for AD, as compared to normal controls. In previous studies, overlaps were observed between areas where the mean diffusivity increases and areas where brain regions shrink, but there are more regions and larger areas where the diffusion coefficient increases. Therefore, the mean diffusivity may be a more suitable clinical index than the current method of brain volume. In addition, there is a correlation between increased mean diffusivity and the severity of mild cognitive impairment or AD. Amyloid deposition is consistent with disease progression, further supporting that mean diffusivity can be used to reflect the progression of mild cognitive impairment and AD.||The investigator plan to use Compressed Sensing to increase the speed of diffusion MRI. This includes image preprocessing, acquisition of Compressed Sensing observations, rebuilding the model, and reconstructing the algorithm. The investigator also plan to overcome the current limitations of region-of-interest analysis. One way of achieving this is by voxelwise analysis, however it has limitations caused by normalization of the image to a template space, and possible problems in tractography caused by rotation or distortion of the image. Furthermore, the use of a study specific template prevents the results from being available in Brodmann or Talairach coordinates. Most importantly, voxel analysis is not based on brain regions, so it is difficult to determine the properties of each region, and according to our algorithm, a large amount of voxel data would greatly reduce the resolution of the statistics and cause problems in statistical analysis. Therefore, the investigator have to use a common standard space, and develop a suitable imaging technique.||The investigator choose to use Automatic Anatomical Labelling (AAL), as this is a commonly used system used in neuroscience research. The investigator also use the Montreal Neuroscience Institute 152 Template (MNI152) as out standard template. In the imaging and processing of the whole brain, the investigator use Affine Transformation, as this is commonly used for MRI and diffusion MRI. This includes Camino, FSL, and SPM. The investigator will study how the aging of a healthy brain changes the diffusion MRI and make comparisons between aging in males and females.||The investigator will also use Deep Learning to increase the sensitivity and specificity and to improve the accuracy of classification and diagnosis, by data set sample allocation data preprocessing, and deep neural network design.||Using AAL, whole brain parcellation will be performed to obtain diffusion MRI information of regions in the brain. Affected regions will be identified and analysed. The investigator hope that diffusion MRI using whole brain regions can be used for differential diagnosis and for identifying regions that have high correlation with clinical severity, and for accurate disease diagnosis and prognosis, to serve as a reference for clinicians.||The investigator aim to use diffusion MRI to assess cognitive function and evaluate if it deteriorates in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the investigator hope to use diffusion MRI to determine the disease severity and prognosis. Worsening of neurodegeneration and cognitive ability brings about increased mortality and poorer quality of life. The relationship between diffusion MRI results and disease severity may provide an objective method allowing clinicians to diagnose these diseases with greater confidence and earlier on in disease onset, before the worsening of symptoms.||The study will be completed in three phases, over three years. In the first year, the investigator hope to establish an optimal high-quality imaging compression sensing scheme and image data restoration process for diffusion MRI. The investigator also hope to develop an optimal method for brain parcellation, and to use deep learning to improve diagnosis of patients with mild cognitive impairment.||In the second year, the investigator hope to establish a process for predicting the prognosis of patients with typical and atypical PD, using deep learning. The investigator also hope to complete our evaluation of using deep learning for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment.||In the third year, the investigator aim to complete the development of a method for predicting the prognosis of patients with typical and atypical PD. The investigator will also establish and complete our method of using deep learning to evaluate if patients with mild cognitive development will develop AD.

NCT04164043,"The purpose of this project is to evaluate a currently active community-based Recreational Therapy (RT) Wellness Recovery Program (WRP) for individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) to determine the efficacy of the treatment intervention. Since PD is a progressive, degenerative neurological disease, it is critical that individuals with this diagnosis remain as active as possible to slow down the progression of the disease, improve balance and strength, and increase health-related quality of life. The overall goal of this project is to determine the efficacy of a neuroplasticity physical activity program in terms of improving balance, improving health-related quality of life, reducing stress, and increasing satisfaction in exercise including social connectedness of group exercise. There is evidence that the neuroplasticity model may be a more effective type of intervention than traditional exercise programs in improving symptoms of PD. The neuroplasticity approach requires repetition of complex tasks that are high intensity and present a novel challenge. This type of intervention has been shown to improve motor and cognitive behaviors which are critical areas of decline for those with PD. The WRP program uses a comprehensive neuroplasticity-principled program that integrates exercise and wellness. The PI, Julie Bradwell, LRT/CTRS is a Certified Instructor for Parkinson Wellness Recovery Power Moves. The RT Wellness Recovery program at Wake Forest Baptist Health is modeled on the Parkinson Wellness Recovery Power Moves. Components within the program include the Parkinson Power Moves and the exercise 4 Brain Change. This study will be a 14-week study with the first two weeks of collecting baseline data and immediately following with a 12-week intervention program to increase balance, health-related quality of life, and satisfaction in exercise in individuals with PD as well as reduce stress. Most research on RT interventions for this population are in traditional settings (inpatient or rehabilitation settings). When discharged from these settings, many individuals become less active, have few social interactions and lose the benefits of exercise and physical therapy they gained while in these programs once they are home. The WRP community-based program at Wake Forest Baptist Health has the potential to prevent secondary complications as well as slow down the progression of the disease for participants. If the outcomes of this project suggest this type of intervention will improve the functional skills, quality of life, and/or satisfaction in exercise for individuals with PD and reduce stress, it will provide the RT discipline with evidenced based practice intervention for this population",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT04277247,"Dystonia-associated pain, particularly in the lower limbs is the second most common type of pain in Parkinson's disease (PD).

PD is a disorder whose primary disability stems from motor dysfunction including balance. Recent studies have shown that the risk of falling in the elderly can be reduced through the practice of the Chinese complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) such as T'ai Chi Chuan (TCC). This finding may be highly significant to PD. Although a recent report from Emory suggests PD patients can do well with aerobic (walk-run) exercise training (AET), it is still unclear whether the potential anti-Parkinsonian effect of such modalities is secondary to improved physical fitness (CRF), motor control or both. CAM interventions such as TCC may offer a unique opportunity to examine these fundamental questions.||In PD we hypothesize that exercise training will reduce primary and secondary disability and that some of these changes represent adaptive reprogramming of central motor pathways. We will conduct a controlled double-blind, 16-week dose-response study of exercise based on caloric expenditure and thus on the cardiorespiratory fitness effects of exercise (CRF). The treatments will be Qi Gong (minimal caloric expenditure), TCC (low expenditure), and walk-cycle AET (moderate expenditure).||We will examine exercise-induced change in motor control using quantitative measures of motor disability, including dynamic gait stability measures. We will also examine exercise effects on central and peripheral indices of Parkinsonian motor disability.||A caloric ""dose-response"" effect of exercise would suggest CRF is a major determinant of the anti-Parkinsonian effects of exercise. If the Chinese modalities are as effective or superior to AET however, this would suggest that other mechanisms such as change in central motor programming may be playing a role (e.g. relaxation effects, reinforcement of central motor programs?). A better understanding of exercise-induced neural plasticity and motor control would offer a significant, and heretofore unexploited rehabilitative potential in PD.",Parkinson’s Disease

NCT00909545,"There is solid scientific rational and preclinical data supporting a clinical trial of isradipine CR as a potential disease modifying agent in early PD. Human pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve the serum concentrations in humans that were neuroprotective in preclinical models with the FDA approved dosage range. Pilot data demonstrate acceptable tolerability of isradipine CR in the PD population. Tolerability is inversely proportional to the dosage dependent. Considering that tolerability of isradipine CR is inversely proportional to the dosage exposure, it is essential to proceed with the dose selection tolerability study in preparation for the future efficacy trials.||The tolerability, defined as the ability to complete the study, of three dosages of isradipine CR relative to placebo in subjects with early Parkinson's disease will be examined first.

NCT04675398,"This study will allow the investigators to evaluate the efficacy of an adaptive stimulation paradigm in deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat motor-related behaviours and motor skill learning in Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkinson's disease patients will be implanted unilaterally or bilaterally with a totally internalized bidirectional neural interface, Medtronic Summit RC+S.||While current DBS therapy improves motor symptoms of PD, it does not address problems with acquiring additional motor skills (i.e. adapting gait patterns to avoid falls)) in PD, therefore, limiting benefits of physical rehabilitation programs aimed at improving mobility. Motor skill learning is critical in acquiring any new behaviors related to motor function. The overall objective is to identify personalized electrophysiological signatures of motor skill learning in PD patients and use adaptive control algorithms to enhance these signatures. The study will discover new ways to rehabilitate the disease brain circuits using adaptive neuromodulation.||In a small, double-blinded trial, ten patients with idiopathic PD and motor fluctuations will be implanted with unilateral or bilateral RC+S devices, each connected to a standard quadripolar DBS lead implanted in the basal ganglia, along with a 4-contact paddle type electrode placed subdurally over the motor cortex. The investigators will compare the overall efficacy of closed-loop and open-loop paradigms in terms of behavioral performance improvements in validated motor skill learning tasks and measurements from wearable devices. During this chronic adaptive DBS phase, adaptive DBS and open-loop stimulation settings will be randomized for 30-day periods and motor skill and gait related measurements will be obtained from a combination of computerized motor tasks and wearable devices that track movement kinematics. Patients will participate in daily, if possible, motor learning and gait tasks at home with triggered stimulation settings and recordings.||The investigators expect to successfully develop a prototype adaptive DBS algorithm based on cortical and / or basal ganglia LFPs (local field potentials). The investigators hypothesize that an adaptive paradigm will provide improvements in motor skilled learning compared to the conventional, open-loop paradigm, in which stimulation parameters remain constant until changed by the patient or clinician using an external programmer.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT02655315,"This is the new concept of ""conservative iron chelation"". We recently demonstrated (for the first time) the feasibility, efficacy and acceptability of the conservative iron chelation approach in pilot translational studies in Parkinson's disease with a prototype drug: deferiprone (1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one) (in the FAIR-PARK-I project led by the applicant and funded by French Ministry of Health). The only available blood-brain-barrier-permeable iron chelator deferiprone is approved for treating systemic iron overload in transfused patients with thalassemia. Deferiprone has been on the European Union market since 1999, with a favourable risk/benefit balance at dose of 75 to 100 mg/kg/day. The investigators shall adopt a repositioning strategy by using deferiprone at a lower dose of 30 mg/kg/day in this new indication for local iron overload in Parkinson's disease. Deferiprone will be the first-in-class drug for this novel therapeutic strategy. On the basis of the preclinical and clinical data from (FAIR-PARK-I), the present (FAIR-PARK-II) project should constitute a model for future cytoprotection strategies in neurodegenerative diseases; if deferiprone treatment is associated with significant slower disease progression, it would be the first non-dopaminergic drug to have a proven disease-modifying effect in Parkinson's disease.",Parkinson’s Disease
NCT04249245,"Olfactory dysfunction is frequent in Parkinson Disease (PD) and may be present years before the motor symptoms appear. The early olfactory dysfunction could result from environmental factors acting through the nasal cavity such as microbial communities. Local inflammation induced by a nasal bacterial dysbiosis (microbiota imbalance) could lead to early neuronal dysfunctions in the olfactory system propagating in all the brain, thus inducing motor, cognitive and emotional manifestations in PD, in keeping with the Braak's stage hypothesis. We propose a translational project aiming at investigating the potential influence of nasal dysbiosis in PD pathogenesis. First, we will analyze both olfaction and nasal microbiota in a large series of PD patients and test the link between olfactory deficits and nasal dysbiosis. Then, we will take advantage of studying two populations of subjects with a very different environmental exposure (in mainland France and French West Indies) to isolate the abnormalities of the nasal microbiota that could be specific for PD. The study will be performed in 160 patients and 160 healthy volunteers. Patients will be enrolled in two investigators sites of which different environmental exposure: 1) Guadeloupe Hospital, French West Indies and 2) Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France.

NCT01401582,"The ""Dementia: life- and person-centered help in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (DelpHi)"" trial was a pragmatic, general practitioner (GP)-based, cluster-randomized intervention study with two arms, an intervention group and a care as usual (CAU) group. T The design, eligibility and inclusion criteria, intervention and baseline characteristics of the trial have been described in detail elsewhere.||To reduce the risk of contamination across groups, GP practices were the unit of randomization and determined the patients´ group status. At the beginning of the study, a total of 854 GPs in 5 municipalities of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania were invited to participate by mail. GPs expressing an interest in the study were visited by the investigators to convey additional detailed information about the study. Finally, 136 GPs (16%) gave written informed consent (IC) to participate and agreed to adhere to the DelpHi-study protocol. There were no restrictions regarding the GPs' treatment of patients.||GPs systematically assessed the eligibility of patients for the trial during routine care (eligibility criteria for screening: age >70 years, living at home). Patients were screened using screening procedure. This individual interview-based instrument is widely used for dementia screening in GP practices in Germany. Patients who screened positive were informed about the study by their GP, invited to participate and asked to provide written IC. If the patients listed a caregiver, he or she was asked to participate as well. When patients were unable to provide written IC, their legal representative was asked to sign the consent form on their behalf. The study physicians received allowances for performing the screening (10€ per patient) and study enrollment (100€ per patient).||Identical, standardized, computer-assisted face-to-face interviews with all participants were conducted at the participants' homes by specifically trained nurses over an average of three separate visits (1) immediately after study inclusion (baseline) and (2) 12 months later (follow-up). To minimize participant burden, the assessment sessions were restricted to one hour.||Dementia Care Management is a complex intervention that aims to provide ""optimal care"" by integrating multi-professional and multimodal strategies for improving patient- and caregiver-related outcomes. DCM individualizes and optimizes dementia treatment and care within the framework of the established health care and social service system. It was developed according to current guidelines targeted at the individual participant level and delivered at participants´ homes by 6 nurses with dementia-specific training. Nurses were supported by a computer-based intervention-management system (IMS) to improve systematic identification of patients' and caregivers' unmet needs and the subsequent recommendation of interventions to address these needs. The training as well as software are described in more detail elsewhere.||The primary outcomes pertain to the individual participants: (a) Quality of life, measured by the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease instrument (QolAD); (b) Caregiver burden, measured by the ""Berlin Inventory of Caregivers' Burden with Dementia Patients (BIZA-D)""; (c) Behavioral and psychological symptoms, measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI); (d) Use of pharmacotherapy with antidementia drugs, which included the following substances recommended by relevant guidelines: donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine; and (e) Use of potentially inadequate medication (PIM), evaluated using the Priscus criteria..||Sample size: No previous data on the main outcome measures were available to use for sample size calculation. Therefore, sample size was estimated based on theoretical assumptions. In the design, the minimally important difference (MID) for determining the efficacy was considered to be of at least a small effect, defined by Cohen's d (d = 0.2 48). Comparing two groups at a significance level of α = 0.05, assuming a statistical power of 80% and an intra-class correlation with clustering by GP practice of zero a sample size of 310 persons per group would have been sufficient 48. Considering the longitudinal design, we accounted for a loss over time of 35% (death, withdrawal of IC) and determined that 477 persons per group with complete datasets would have been needed to be included in the study. We estimated that GPs would identify n=1,000 participants over the course of 2 years. Recruitment turned out to be slower than expected. Thus recruitment was prolonged from two to three years. The sample size achieved allows to detect a medium effect size (Cohen´s d=0.5) 48.||Randomization/allocation We used simple 1:1 randomization without stratification or matching. This procedure was sufficient due to the high number of expected clusters in our study 49. GPs were not informed of their randomization status. However, due to the type of intervention, GPs became aware of their status throughout the course of the study. Participants were recruited and enrolled by participating GPs but allocated to the study group by study center. Since baseline assessment and delivery of intervention needed to be performed by the same nurses, a blinding was not possible.",Dementia
NCT04258358,"The CASCADE ways of working draw on the person's strengths to optimize safety and independent living in their community. The ways of working incorporate learning and development for all stakeholders to enhance interactions with people living with dementia; use of technology to improve access to specialist care as well as safety in the community; and holistic care tailored to the needs of the person to improve and maintain well being. These elements work in tandem to enable people living with dementia to engage in meaningful leisure and activities of daily living.||The evaluation study aims to explore the benefits of the CASCADE model of care (ways of working) on service users (people with dementia and their caregivers), staff and service providers. The evaluation comprises elements of outcome and process evaluation. The outcome evaluation involves quantitative measures of health, well being and cost benefits while the process evaluation explores intervention implementation procedures to find out what worked and how it worked. The CASCADE model of care assumes that using the person's strengths to guide holistic personalized dementia care is a sustainable approach to safe meaningful independent living and improving public perceptions.||Investigators will use a quasi-experiment to assess quantifiable benefits (health and well being outcomes and cost benefits) of the CASCADE model for people with dementia. This means, investigators will compare two groups of people with dementia including one that will receive care under the CASCADE model (intervention group) and the second group will not. The anticipation is that comparing the two groups will make benefits of people receiving care under the CASCADE ways of working more observable. Participants will not be allocated randomly to the study arms because service use will be dependent on assessed need for referrals and need and affordability for self-referred users. This implies there is no opportunity to randomize participants to either the intervention or control groups. Time point measures will include pre-intervention (T0), and two follow up points (T1 and T2).||It is anticipated that 160 people living with dementia will take part in the study (respite intervention group n= 50; respite control group n=50; long term care intervention group n= 30; long term care control group n= 30). Other participants will include family or informal carers (n= 20) and staff delivering care (n=70).||The residential mode of the intervention will minimize cases of missing data.

It is unlikely that data will be Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), but data Missing at Random will be assessed using appropriate statistical procedures such as analysis via the patterns command to determine patterns of missingness and their frequency and to examine variables predictive of missing data. Investigators will eliminate dropouts or noncompliance from analyses, if missing data are more than 20%. Similarly, if data are not Missing at Random, investigators will use last observation carried forward (LOCF) method particularly for participants in long term care to maintain the sample size and minimize confounding effects of noncompliance or attrition.",Dementia

These questionnaires will be provided by the research team to the potential participants, identified by care home staff, together with the information pack and consent forms.||A music listening session will be arranged where the resident and their informal carer/Consultee/attorney will be played 30 seconds excerpts of each of the tracks (in 15 minute blocks over a period of up to 1 hour). The resident will be asked to wear a monitor on their wrist, similar to a watch, in order to monitor movement and pulse rate. The session will be filmed to enable analysis of emotional responses to music using machine learning analysis of changes in facial expression, as well as directly observed movements of hands, feet and/ or head. Where necessary the music listening session can be split into multiple shorter sessions to accommodate resident or care home requirements. Responses to the 30 second excerpts will be used to generate a refined personalised playlist for each participant, anticipated to be between 10 and 20 tracks.||The refined personalised playlists will be played to residents in music listening sessions throughout the duration of the study. How long music is played for and how frequently will, for the feasibility study, be determined by the resident, care home staff and/or informal carers. Different delivery methods for delivering personalised music will be tested including use of wireless headphones, smart speakers or other wireless speakers and their effectiveness and ease of use assessed through feedback from residents and focus groups and interviews with informal carers and care home staff. Duration and frequency of music listening sessions will, where possible, be logged through the listening history in the music app used and/or through data recorded by care home staff or informal carers.||A short training session will be provided in each participating care home to train staff and informal carers on delivering personalised music listening and collecting observational data (e.g. on timing of listening and observed effects on mood and behaviour). Fidelity, acceptability and appropriateness of the interventions will be assessed by the research team through the observation of selected personalised music listening sessions.||Approaches to assessing responses to the music that will be used include analysis of facial expression changes and movement in video footage, heart rate changes and qualitative information provided in reports from a member of the research team, residents, care home staff and/or informal carers. Impacts on well-being of residents over time will be assessed using scores derived from inventories for behavioural and psychological symptom assessment as a proxy, e.g. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH), including for depression/apathy and anxiety/agitation. The Health-Related Quality of Life Measure for people living with dementia (DEMQOL) and DEMQOL-Proxy (administered with the informal carer/Consultee) will also be completed. It is expected that these tools will be used before the intervention and between 1 and 3 further times for each resident participant at appropriate intervals during the period of the study.||For this study the use of qualitative and quantitative assessment tools is for the purpose of developing and testing the appropriateness of personalised music listening and assessment methodologies rather than to draw conclusions about efficacy or otherwise of the intervention itself (which would be the subject of further studies subject to subsequent ethical approval). The quantitative data generated, therefore will only be used to supplement qualitative assessments to help infer/indicate factors for further investigation in subsequent feasibility studies and a longer-term larger scale intervention study i.e. to inform the design of those studies. Therefore, in this feasibility study, analysis of the quantitative measures is not intended to produce statistically significant data (the statistics involved will be mostly descriptive and, in some cases, inferential). Together with subsequent feasibility studies, it is intended to inform the design of the larger scale intervention study in which the sample size will be calculated to produce statistically significant results.||The study will trial the use of facial expression change through automated analysis of video footage. The initial pilot showed a strong correlation between the scores, indicating that, after further calibration, absolute thresholds can be derived to classify a track as either high or low response. Deep-learning facial expression change analysis will be developed to determine the feasibility or otherwise of using automated analysis of facial expression change in video footage. This will involve:||Acquiring videos at 30 frames per second while music is played, extracting 1 image per second and generating 3 features for each.|Performing face detection using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Application Programming Interface (API) and extracting an emotion score from the facial expression in 8 categories: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise. The research team will then form a secondary score based on a linear combination of these expressions and assign it to each frame.|The research team will then aggregate the values of all frames acquired while a track was played to form a total response score by assigning different weights to the frames and deriving first-order statistics from the resulting distribution. The researchers can then compare the scores to subjective observation.||The views of care home staff and informal carers/Consultees/attorneys about the intervention will be sought throughout the study, via the means of focus group discussions and interviews. These focus group discussions and interviews will be conducted with care home staff and families in order to explore their views of how personalised playlists have an impact on residents including their impressions of the effect of variables such as timing of listening or the impact on difficult care situations. Direct feedback will also be sought from participating residents themselves, where feasible.||Informed consent for participation will be obtained, including for participation by informal carers/Consultees and care home staff, as well as residents. If anyone participating in the study, in any way indicates that they do not want to take part or in any way indicates that they are unhappy or distressed, then their participation will be paused (e.g. a different track played or a different question asked) and if the distress persists, the session will be stopped.||Informal carers/Consultees/attorneys will provide qualitative assessments of any benefits or disbenefits to them arising from the impact of personalised music listening on the behavioural and psychological symptoms of their relative/friend (e.g. improving relationship with carers and family). These assessments will be provided through participation in structured focus groups. Informal carers/Consultees/attorneys will participate in up to 3 focus groups, conducted by a member of the research team, experienced in qualitative research, once the refined personalised playlist is completed, between 2 and 4 months later and at the conclusion of their participation in the study.||Care home staff will provide qualitative assessments of any benefits or disbenefits to them arising from the impact of personalised music listening on the behavioural and psychological symptoms of the resident, for example:||improving relationship with carers and family;|improved quality or ease of care provision such as easing of distress caused by difficult care events.; and|ease of incorporation of personalised music therapy into the usual working practices of the care homes.||These assessments will be provided through participation in structured focus groups.

NCT04175977,"As the population ages, the incidence rate of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (dementia) is expected to triple. The National Alzheimer's Plan recognizes that while the number of persons with dementia (PWD) is increasing substantially, the healthcare and long term care systems are unprepared to provide high quality, effective and efficient care to the PWD and their caregivers. PWD often have many behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) including agitation, depression and sleep disturbances that affect both the quality of life (QOL) of the PWD and the caregiver. Unfortunately, due to a lack of programs to insert evidence-based care into the community, and hospice system specifically, PWD receive inappropriate and even harmful care.

NCT00459784,"Background Early diagnosis of dementia benefits both patient and caregiver. Nevertheless, dementia in primary care is currently under-diagnosed in developed countries. In several countries educational interventions were developed to improve dementia diagnosis and management in primary care. Some of these interventions were successful in increasing the number of dementia diagnoses and in changing attitudes and knowledge of health care staff. However, none of these interventions focussed on collaboration between GPs and nurses in dementia care. We developed a Dementia Training Program (DTP) aimed at stimulating collaboration in dementia primary care. We expect it to increase the number of cognitive assessments and dementia diagnoses, as well as to improve attitudes and knowledge of GPs and nurses.||Methods/Design The DTP is a complex educational intervention and consists of 2 workshops, a coaching program, and case-based consultations either face-to-face or by phone or e-mail, access to an internet forum, and a Computerized Clinical Decision Support System on dementia diagnostics and management. 100 duos of GPs and nurses will be recruited, from which 2/3 will be allocated to the intervention group and 1/3 to the control group. The effects of implementation of the DTP will be studied in an assessor blinded cluster-randomised controlled trial. Primary outcomes are the number of cognitive assessments and dementia diagnosis in a period of 9 months, starting after workshop participation of the duos. Secondary outcomes are measured on GP and nurse level: rate of adherence to national guidelines for dementia diagnosis, attitude, confidence and knowledge regarding dementia diagnosis and management; on patient level: number of emergency calls, visits and consultations and patient satisfaction; and on caregiver level: informal caregiver burden and satisfaction. Data will be collected from GPs' electronic medical dossiers, self registration forms and questionnaires. Statistical analysis will be performed by using MANOVA-method. Also, exploratory analyses will be performed, in order to gain insight into barriers and facilitators for implementation and the causal relations between the rate of success of the intervention components and the outcomes.",Dementia

NCT00291161,"Background:||Dementia affects the entire family by negatively impacting multiple domains including physical health, emotional health, social relationships, and legal and financial issues (Gurland, 1980; Kunik, Snow, Molinari, Menke, Souchek, Sullivan et al, 2003; Schulz, Visintainer, & Williamson, 1990; Wright, Clipp, & George, 1993). Particularly challenging is accessing the range of services needed to address the care needs of both the individual with dementia and the primary family caregiver. Common issues include: obtaining adequate diagnostic testing; understanding treatment options and medications; difficulties with memory and behavioral symptoms; and care- and illness-related strain (Mitnick, Leffler, & Hood, 2010). Additionally, many unmet care needs are the result of service fragmentation and inadequate communication among different medical providers, medical providers and consumers, and medical providers and community services (Reuben, Levin, Frank, 2009).||Built upon two prior studies: the Cleveland Alzheimer's Managed Care Demonstration (Bass, Clark, Looman, McCarthy, & Eckert, 2003) and the Chronic Care Networks for Alzheimer's Disease (CCN/AD) (Maslow & Bass, 2003; Maslow & Selstad, 2001), PDC was a 5-year research investigation that tested the effectiveness of a telephone-based, innovative care-coordination intervention designed to address the unmet care needs of Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers across all dementia stages. PDC was implemented through formal partnerships between the VA medical centers and local Alzheimer's Association (AA) chapters. Essential features of PDC included: 1) formal partnerships between VA medical centers and Alzheimer's Association Chapters; 2) a multidimensional assessment and treatment approach, 3) ongoing monitoring and long-term relationships with families; and 4) a computerized information system to guide service delivery and fidelity monitoring. For a complete description of the PDC intervention protocol please see Judge, Bass, Snow, Wilson, Morgan, Looman, McCarthy, and Kunik (2010).||Objectives:||The primary objective of this investigation is to rigorously test the impact of PDC on a number of outcomes for Veterans with dementia, family caregivers, and healthcare providers. Within VA Medical Centers, the focus will be on improving dementia care in primary care clinics, including geriatrics.||Two specific research objectives and corresponding hypotheses will be addressed:||To test the impact of PDC on three categories of outcomes: psychosocial well-being outcomes (patient and caregiver effects); healthcare service use (patient effects only); and health care cost (patient effects only).||Hypothesis 1: PDC, compared with usual care, will improve psychosocial well-being, including depression, health status, adequacy of care, and quality of care for patients with dementia and their caregivers.||Hypothesis 2: PDC, compared with usual care, will reduce healthcare service use for patients with dementia, including hospital admissions, emergency department visits, nursing home admissions, and physician visits.||Hypothesis 3: PDC is preferred to usual care, based on cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses.||Hypothesis 4: The PDC intervention will be more effective than usual care in improving psychosocial well-being and reducing health care service use for patients and caregivers dealing with more severe patient impairment (e.g., cognitive status, functional status, and level of problem behaviors).||To evaluate the impact of PDC on role and intra-psychic strains caused by dementia and its care (patient and caregiver effects).||Hypothesis 5a: PDC, compared with usual care, will decrease patient role and intra-psychic strain, including embarrassment about the illness, emotional strain, relationship strain, and social isolation.||Hypothesis 5b: PDC, compared with usual care, will decrease caregiver role and intra-psychic strain, including role captivity, work care-related strain, relationship strain, emotional and physical health deterioration, and caregiving efficacy.||Hypothesis 6: The PDC intervention will be more effective than usual care in decreasing role and intra-psychic strains for patients and caregivers dealing with more severe patient impairment (e.g., cognitive status, functional status, and level of problem behaviors).||Methods:||The proposed study was a 55-month, controlled trial of PDC. The project was conducted at two intervention sites and three comparison sites matched on organizational, provider, and patient characteristics.||Partners in Dementia Care was compared to usual care. Both groups received educational materials about dementia at the start.||PDC Intervention The Chronic Care Model (Bodenheimer, Wagner, & Grumbach, 2002; Bodenheimer, Wagner, & Grumbach, 2002) was used as an overarching framework to implement PDC and included the following components: 1) Formal linkages between medical centers (the VA) and community agencies (the Alzheimer's Association); 2) Organizational support from key leaders and broad-based training about PDC; 3) Delivery system redesign and decision support systems; 4) Self-management of dementia as outlined by the PDC intervention protocol; 5) The development of the PDC Care Coordination Information System (CCIS) as the clinical information system.||PDC had four primary ways of assisting families: 1) providing disease-related education and information; 2) offering emotional support and coaching; 3) linking families to medical and non-medical services and resources; and 4) mobilizing and organizing the informal care network. Two key staff members implemented the intervention: a VA Dementia Care Coordinator (VA DCC) in VA medical centers and an Alzheimer's Association Care Consultant (AA CC) in Alzheimer's Association Chapters. VA DCCs primarily focused on veterans' medical and non-medical needs and assisted families with effectively using VA resources; AA CCs primarily focused on needs of informal caregivers such as care-related strain and accessing non-VA resources. The intervention protocol consisted of: 1) Assessment of Care Needs across medical and non-medical care issues that addressed 23 domains for Veterans and 14 domains for caregivers; 2) Development of Care Goals that matched the priorities of Veterans and caregivers; 3) Development of Action Steps which were concrete behavioral tasks intended to help families move toward goal achievement (e.g., individual responsible for completing each task, expected completion date); 4) On-going Monitoring of Action Steps on a regular basis to ensure timely completion of tasks, address potential barriers, modify or add action steps, and identify new goals.||Analytic Plan With one exception, measures of ""objective"" characteristics, including community and support-service use, service knowledge, number of informal helpers, and Veterans' impairments, were based on information reported by caregivers. The one exception was a measure of impairment based on scores from a standardized mental status test that was administered to Veterans over the telephone (i.e., the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test; Katzman et al., 1983). Additionally, a small number of Veterans (approximately 5%) with mild dementia did not have a caregiver; ""objective"" characteristics for these individuals were self-reported by the Veteran. Information used to construct measures of ""subjective"" characteristics, such as feelings about or perceptions of the quality of care and care-related strain, came directly from the individual whose feelings or perceptions were being represented.",Dementia
NCT03208517,"The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded Well-being and Health for People with Dementia (WHELD) programme, An Optimized Person Centred Intervention to Improve Quality of Life for People with Dementia Living in Care Homes. This optimized intervention is based on a factorial study and qualitative evaluation, to combine: training on person-centred care, promoting person-centred activities and interactions, and providing care home staff and general practitioners with updated knowledge regarding optimal use of psychotropic medications for persons with dementia in care homes. Using a train-the-trainer model, the intervention was delivered by trained therapists, who trained 2 lead care staff members (WHELD champions) within each care home to implement the intervention over a 9-month period.||The primary objective of this study involving 24 care homes, with approximately 240 care staff, is to determine whether an online version of the optimized WHELD intervention, with or without supervision support, confers significant benefit in terms of improving attitudes of care staff caring for people with dementia and quality of care of residents with dementia living in care homes.||There is considerable interest in e-learning and dementia. Significant investment has been made into the production of resources for care staff but to date there appears to be no, or very limited, evaluation of the effectiveness of e-learning in either raising awareness amongst care staff, or increasing outcomes of care for people with dementia. In spite of the lack of evidence, e-learning remains popular with care home providers and managers, as they are perceived to be low-cost, can be delivered to staff on-site or even at home, and with minimal disruption to staffing routines and schedules.||The e-learning programme is based on the aforementioned WHELD RCT programme, which included over 80 care homes and 1000 participants in the study, and has already shown significant benefits in improvements in quality of life and agitation. This study will provide pilot testing to evaluate the effectiveness of an e-learning version.||Key secondary objectives will be to determine the specific impact of the e-learning intervention on a range of outcomes including quality of care, quality of the interaction of care staff with people with dementia, person-centered practice, staff knowledge about dementia and staff general health, work stress and experience working with residents with dementia.||The investigators hypothesize that the intervention (in particular with supervision support) will significantly improve several key outcomes.

NCT03001232,"Background:||In the Netherlands, an estimated number of 70.000 patients with dementia are institutionalized. This number is expected to increase rapidly in the coming years due to the aging population. Loss of independence in activities of daily living (ADL) is an important predictor for institutionalization and an important determinant for the quality of life. Once institutionalized, independence in ADL tends to decline even more rapid.This rapid decline may be due to insufficient stimulation of the patients' remaining abilities. Underestimating the patient's abilities may contribute to the inactive lifestyle in nursing homes. An inactive lifestyle negatively affects multiple disease outcomes. In the present study, movement-oriented dementia care (MDC) is implemented on psychogeriatric wards of a Dutch nursing home. MDC focuses on the integration of physical activity in the daily lives of nursing home residents with dementia. The key element of MDC is the multidisciplinary approach to ensure physical stimulation at all times. The following disciplines are involved in MDC: nursing staff, department heads, paramedics (physiotherapists and occupational therapists), psychologists, geriatrics specialists, activity leaders, volunteers and family caregivers. The primary aim is to evaluate the effect of MDC on ADL independence and quality of life. Additionally, the effect on mood, behaviour, cognition, and physical fitness is investigated.||The present study was a non-randomized 12-month longitudinal study with two parallel groups. The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Exam Committee (METc) of the VUmc.||Participants were residents from five psychogeriatric wards of two locations of nursing home Solis in Deventer. All participants were diagnosed with dementia.||Recruitment: In the first place, the staff of Nursing home Solis was informed about the intervention. Consequently, an initial selection of suitable clients took place. Clients receiving palliative care did not participate in the study. Suitable clients and their caregivers were informed about the study by means of an informative presentation as well as an informative letter in which clients and their caregivers were asked to give informed consent.||Randomisation:Two locations of nursing home Solis were non-randomly allocated to the experimental or control condition. Participants living at the experimental location received movement-oriented dementia care (MDC), while participants living at the control location received care as usual.||Procedure: Movement-oriented Dementia Care was given to as many residents as possible from the psychogeriatric wards of the intervention location. In order to properly implement movement-oriented care, nursing staff, activity leaders and living room staff were offered a schooling aimed at increasing awareness of the importance of movement, as well as providing tools for stimulating movement in elderly with dementia. Caregivers and volunteers received information about movement during an information meeting. The execution of the movement-oriented care differed per discipline. Nursing staff continuously encouraged clients to function as independently as possible. This regards activities such as getting dressed, preparing meals, pouring coffee, and toilet use. Paramedics coached the nursing staff by specifying medical and physical limits of each participant. Additionally, they gave advice on how to handle specific situations. They also informed and coached caregivers on how to safely stimulate movement with clients. Based on these advises, a plan was created for each resident to determine the daily routines that they are capable of performing, as well as how to stimulate the participants to engage in physical activities. Activity leaders were informed on how to include movement interventions in their activities. In addition, activity leaders constructed a leisure-care calendar focusing on general activities based on personal preferences and potentials. Family caregivers and volunteers were encouraged to stimulate physical activity of the patients in general.||Nursing staff were trained by an expert in MDC (three sessions of three hours), in order to increase awareness of the importance of physical activity, as well as the role of physical activity in ADL. Additionally, paramedics received a two-hour meeting informing them on their role in advising nursing staff. Volunteers and family caregivers were informed about the benefits of an active lifestyle during several open meetings.||The outcome variables were measured 5 times, i.e. at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of the intervention. Trained physiotherapists performed the measurements with participants, while nursing staff and caregivers were asked to fill in questionnaires. The test battery administered by the clients had a maximum duration of 30 to 45 minutes, in which the client was free to take breaks.||To ensure compliance to the intervention, one staff member at each psychogeriatric ward became an 'ambassador' of MDC, responsible for implementation at their ward. Process evaluations were administered for nursing staff and caregivers every three months to measure the extent of implementation. These process evaluations consisted of structured interviews and questionnaires. Questionnaires were completed by nursing staff and family caregivers every three months. Structured interviews were conducted with members of a multidisciplinary focus group after three and nine months. The focus group consisted of 12 professionals; nurses, activity leaders, heads of the departments, 'ambassadors', a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist. The process evaluations focused on the following elements:||To which extent did staff and family carers prepare to provide MDC?|Which aspects of MDC are applied?|Is MDC applied according to its core principles?|To what extent are participants stimulated to be physically active?|Are the staff and family carers satisfied with the execution of MDC?|What barriers are experienced?||The following demographic data was registered per participant: subtype dementia, birth year (age), sex, education, severity of dementia, comorbidities, cardiovascular risk factors and medication use.||The severity of dementia was determined using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The scores ranged from 0 (severe cognitive impairment) to 30 (no cognitive impairment). The recommended cut-off point of 24 was applied, with a score of 23 or lower indicating dementia.||Comorbidities were derived from the medical charts of the participants and were categorized according to the Dutch translation of the Long-Term Care Facility Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI), section I disease diagnosis. The section consists of 44 subcategories that belong to eight categories. The sum of the subcategories was used as a comorbidity score. Information regarding cardiovascular risk factors was derived from the medical charts of the participants.",Dementia
NCT03160027,"Photobiomodulation (PBM) describes a kind of light therapy that uses red or near-infrared light to stimulate, heal, regenerate, and protect tissue that has either been injured, is degenerating, or else is at risk of dying. Human cadaver studies have shown near-infrared wavelengths can penetrate 40-50 mm through the scalp and skull. Saltmarche et al. (2017) recently reported that 12-weeks of transcranial treatment with a commercially available PBM device (i.e., the Vielight ""Neuro "") benefits cognitive function in patients with mild-to-moderately severe dementia. Specifically, Saltmarche et al. reported improvements on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE, p< 0.003) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog, p< 0.03) in 5 dementia patients after 12-weeks of PBM treatment.||The first aim of this trial is to replicate Saltmarche et al' s findings that the effects of 12-weeks of PBM treatment can improve cognitive function in older adults with dementia. Because the Vielight Neuro device targets nodes of the default mode network (DMN), which is dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the second aim of this pilot study is to investigate whether 12 weeks of PBM therapy with the Vielight Neuro device improves DMN connectivity in older adults with dementia. Finally, because there is suggestive evidence that PBM therapy enhances blood flow, the third aim of the trial is to examine whether 12-weeks of PBM therapy improves cerebral blood flow (CBF) in older adults with dementia. The trial will also explore the effects of PBM treatment on quality of life in older adults with dementia and on caregiver burden.||Ten older adults with dementia (i.e., the primary study participants, PP) and their caregivers (CG) will be enrolled in a randomized, wait-list control trial.

NCT04443621,"A. Introduction to project, current state of art As the population ages, an increasing number of people will be diagnosed with dementia. At present, there are some 47 million people living with dementia worldwide. In Czech Republic, there are about 156,000 people suffering from dementia. Regional estimates of dementia prevalence in people aged 60 years and over now range from 4.6% in Central Europe to 8.7% in North Africa and the Middle East. It is estimated up to 131 million people with dementia will live in the world by 2050. Thus, there is a need of sensitive and specific cognitive assessment tools to detect cognitive impairment. It enables to provide timely intervention to delay the disease progression, prolong independence, and enhance the quality of life (QoL) and personal dignity of the individual with dementia.||Dementia is neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive, irreversible and still incurable cognitive decline. People suffering from dementia retain their positive personality traits and character. However, as the illness progresses, symptoms such as memory loss, speech impairment, disorientation, difficulties with activities of daily living, and self-neglect are common. This leads to a significant interference with everyday social and work activities and has a negative impact on subjective perception of dignity. At present, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is used in the Czech Republic to diagnose dementia. Due to copyright issues with the MMSE (similar to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] questionnaire), there is a need for another valid tool to be free available in the country. Currently, the most frequently used tool in the world is the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III), which is composed of five domains: orientation and attention; memory; fluency; language, and visuospatial function. The ACE-III-J is a sensitive and specific screening test to diagnose dementia, and it was better than the MMSE in accuracy for identifying dementia.||Dignity is described as an integral part of QoL. Similarly to QoL, dignity can also be understood as a multidimensional concept including: dignity of identity (self-worth/worthiness, integrity, trust); dignity as a human right (equality, freedom of choice); and dignity as expression of autonomy (independence, control. There are three main dimensions essential for constituting dignity: A historical dignity-dimension, acknowledging one's own life projects and history; an intrapersonal dignity-dimension, recognizing one's own human worth, and living according to individual values; and an interpersonal dignity-dimension, experiencing being part of a caring and confirming society.||Jacobson (2007) says that dignity exists in two complementary, yet disparate forms. It is understood as a dualistic concept incorporating absolute and relative dignity, objective and subjective dignity, and personal and social dignity. Personal dignity is a type of dignity that is subjectively perceived by an individual and is linked to a sense of worthiness. However, personal dignity is also contingent and contextual, and can be influenced both by an internal aspect, which is the worth and self-respect one ascribes to oneself, as well as by an external aspect, which is the worth and value ascribed to the individual by others.||Patients with a severe chronic disease (such as neurodegenerative) experience existential concerns related to changes in the self because of the disease, as well as the social consequences of the disease (e.g. embarrassment, role changes, loss of independence, and stigmatization), which can severely affect the sense of personal dignity.||Older adults with dementia (OAwD) are often experiencing an ongoing loss of personal dignity, value and security, and experiencing cognitive decline can be a threat towards self-respect and the sense of dignity. The key element of the dementia experience is the effort to preserve one's identity or sense of self and to preserve a meaningful life. Multiple personal losses and changes such as increased dependency, loss of autonomy and gradual loss of abilities or competencies can have a negative impact on the sense of self and the self-esteem of dementia sufferers. Thus, OAwD are in risk of personal dignity loss due to both impact of the disease on their identity and self-esteem, and indirectly through negative social interactions and experiences. Before entering the stage of severe dementia individuals are aware of the progressive decline in their abilities and actively try to cope with this decline. A sound sense of personal dignity is essential to the individual's overall experience of well-being and his/her QoL. Investigation of the factors that maintain and strengthen personal dignity needs to incorporate data collected from those afflicted. However, research how having dementia may impact personal dignity into person's subjective experience of mild to moderate dementia is only very recent.||Pilot data The proposed grant project builds on results of a previous project Trajectories of quality of life by the elderly in in early-stage dementia (No. 16-28628A). The findings of the project confirm that OAwD assess their QoL better when they have a greater sense of personal dignity. The validated Czech version of Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI-CZ) created and tested in our project No. 16-28628A will be used in the proposed project.||B. Project objectives, project timeline and description of methods and approaches To define the factors that pose a threat to personal dignity gives an opportunity for a deeper understanding of these issues. This can subsequently assist healthcare staff with choosing the optimum interventions supporting QoL amongst OAwD. The proposed project responds to a society-wide need to identify and solve psychosocial needs of an ageing population with emphasis on neurodegenerative diseases.||The objective of the project is to investigate the changes in the perception of personal dignity of OAwD. The opportunity to define risk factors threatening personal dignity over the course of dementia will contribute to a deeper understanding of patients' needs. This will help healthcare workers choose the optimum psychosocial interventions in accordance with Evidence Based Practice and thus protect dignity of OAwD as a major component of QoL. This may have a positive effect on the psycho-social dimension of QoL amongst OAwD and may lower the frequency and length of hospitalizations as well as save costs on healthcare and social services.||The main aim is to ascertain how the subjective perception of personal dignity in OAwD changes throughout the course of this disease (trajectory of personal dignity perception) and which factors affect it. Because different types of dementia might have different perceptions of personal dignity related to specific disturbances of cognitive domains, post-hoc subgroup analysis in different forms of dementia will be performed. For the assessment of cognition and diagnosis of dementia, the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III), POBAV, and ALBA questionnaires will be used. For this reason, we need to create and validate a Czech version of the ACE-III as the first stage of the project.||In order to achieve the main aim, five sub-aims were identified which should make it possible to ascertain subjective perception of personal dignity and factors which affect in amongst OAwD:||to create a Czech version of the ACE-III and to conduct a psychometric validation;|to ascertain how the assessment of personal dignity changes over the course of 2 years;|to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors perceived as a threat to dignity;|post-hoc subgroup analysis of results among the different types of dementia;|to define the differences in the perception of personal dignity among OAwD when using quantitative (PDI-CZ) and qualitative (in-depth interview) methods.||C. Methodology In order to reach the set aims, a mixed methods research design (quantitative survey first follow by qualitative interview) will be used to carry out a longitudinal, prospective study.||In the quantitative phase of the project using a battery of standardized questionnaires (3 stages). Research nurse gave QAwD the questionnaires and explained how to complete them. The questionnaires will be completed on project enrolment and then two more times at a 12-month interval.||In the qualitative phase of the research, individual in-depth interviews with OAwD on the topic of dignity (two interviews with each respondent at a 12-month interval) will be conducted, recorded, and transcribed with a subsequent interpretative phenomenological analysis. Two psychologists will be undertaking the interviews, in order to ensure that the interviews are conducted in the most sensitive manner. Informed consent will be secured before each interview. This will be carried out throughout project lifetime.||Questionnaire battery will be included: Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III), Amnesia Light and Brief Assessment (ALBA), POBAV, Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI-CZ), Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS-CZ), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and a batch of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics (including age, sex, level of education, living arrangement, social life, frequency of social visits, telephone contact with relatives/friends, and the daytime spent alone, illnesses, medication, etc).||Sample The sample will consist of community-dwelling (i.e., living at home) older adults. They will be addressed together with their family caregivers in neurologic and geriatric outpatient offices.||Sample size:||First sample (quantitative research) will comprise of 500 respondents (310 OAwD for the longitudinal, three-stage study and 190 older adults for the validation study ACE-III).||Second sample (qualitative research) - after evaluating the 1st stage of the quantitative research, we will select 10 OAwD from the sample group with high level (average scale more than 3) and 10 OAwD who have low level of dignity to understand the different perspectives of perception of personal dignity. The exact number of respondents will depend on the thematic saturation in the course of interviewing.||Data from the quantitative research (validation study, and longitudinal study) will be gathered using a questionnaire from 310 OAwD (longitudinal study) and 190 older adults (half with dementia and half without dementia; validation study ACE-III) in neurologic and geriatric outpatients' departments in four regions of the Czech Republic. All data will be inserted into CASTOR database, from which they will be exported for statistical processing.||Data from the qualitative phase will be gathered using in-depth interviews with 20 OAwD. These respondents we will select after evaluation the 1st stage of the quantitative research (10 OAwD with high and 10 OAwD with low levels of dignity to understand the different perspectives in perception of personal dignity). An interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) will be applied. The IPA is an approach of a qualitative research, which is used to examine how people make sense of their major life experiences. The method is often used to study patients' lived experience. The data will be coded in NVivo 12 software for analysis. To assure reliability of the analysis, two researchers will code the interviews independently and they will confront their results for similarities and differences.",Dementia
NCT04179721,"We will evaluate whether dementia care training improves the perceived ability of PES staff (intervention) and nurse assistant staff (control) to care for hospitalized persons with ADRD. We will use survey methodology in a repeated measures design to evaluate within and between-group differences in attitudes, experience, and satisfaction toward managing patients with ADRD. Measures will be completed at baseline (T1), immediately following training (T2), and at end of the intervention period (T3). This study will utilize a repeated measures design to capture the impact of dementia care training on the experience of PES (intervention unit) and NA (control unit) staff to care for patients with dementia. Measures will be completed at baseline, prior to dementia training (T1: baseline), immediately after completion of the training program (T2: 3 months post-baseline) and following the completion of the 1-year intervention period (T3: 12 months post-training).||A 3 month dementia training program will be implemented on both the intervention and control units.

NCT02271750,"Introduction Dementia The estimated prevalence of dementia in Denmark is 85.000 (2011) and the global prevalence is close to 36 million (2010). Furthermore the number is predicted to double in the next 20 years, primarily due to the demographic ageing. The costs of dementia accounts for 1% of the world's GDP - a perspective that will challenge the current healthcare systems and national economies (1,2,3).||Dementia includes a number of progressive degenerative brain diseases. Dementia is characterized by progressive deterioration in cognition, function and behavior that is sufficiently severe to compromise social and occupational functioning. Dementia is characterized by loss of episodic memory, difficulty in naming and word finding, apraxia, executive dysfunction and changes in personality and mood. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (4, 5, 6).||The pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia remains elusive. For many years the pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimers dementia has been the toxicity caused by the accumulation of the proteins amyloid-beta in plaques and phosphorylated tau associated with neurofibrillary tangles. However, this theory is based on the genetic ""early-onset familial Alzheimers"", which is a less frequent inherited type. Currently, the hypotheses on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer actually disagree with that of the amyloid-beta theory. Thus, there is a need to increase our understanding of the mechanisms leading to the most common forms of Alzheimer's disease. A better understanding of the disease may enable an earlier diagnosis and importantly, a causal treatment of Alzheimer as opposed to the merely symptomatic options available to day (4, 7, 8, 9).||IGF-system One of the main areas of recent research in dementia is the role of neurotrophic support, a research area which embraces insulin and the insulin-like growth factor system. Insulin and the IGF system are important in normal somatic growth, development, tissue repair and regeneration throughout life. Earlier studies have indicated that impairments in cerebral glucose utilization and energy metabolism represent very early abnormalities that precede or accompany the initial stages of cognitive impairment. However, type 2 diabetes, which is often characterized by insulin resistance, has not been established as a cause of Alzheimer although there is a correlation between insulin resistance and cognitive dysfunction.||The cellular signaling pathways of IGF-I and IGF-II overlap to a great extent with the pathways used by insulin, and all three proteins bind to the same receptors though with different affinities. Several studies have shown that the ratio between the concentrations of IGF-I in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma (the CSF/plasma ratio) is reduced in Alzheimer patients. Interestingly, IGF-I seems to promote amyloid-beta clearance.||IGF-II has been less studied but it is expressed in the brain both during development and in adulthood and declines with ageing. In the brain the relative concentration is highest in the hippocampus. (10-14). Furthermore, our group has novel data indicating that in CSF, IGF-II is the most important growth factor when it comes to activating the IGF-I receptor (Mia-Maiken Kallestrup et al., manuscript in preparation).||Memory Memory is a question of consolidation whereby newly learned labile information becomes stronger and resilient to disruption. This process depends on de novo RNA and protein synthesis and the function of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and the CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), both of which are transcription factors. Former studies have shown that there is a binding site for C/EBP in the promoter region of the IGF-II gene in liver and other tissues (10).||IGF-II and memory To solve the puzzle of dementia it is important to explain early changes in biomarkers in early stages of dementia and thereby possibly reveal the pathogenesis and possible treatments. An experiment with rats and memory might already have taken the first step towards this. It has been demonstrated that administration of IGF-II to rats significantly enhances memory retention and prevents forgetting. Furthermore inhibitory avoidance learning (a paradigm in which the subject learns to associate a particular context with the occurrence) leads to an increase in the hippocampal expression of IGF-II. Finally, yet importantly, injections of recombinant IGF-II into hippocampus after training or memory retrieval significantly enhance memory retention and prevent forgetting (10).||Neurotrophic growth factors:||The human adult brain is able to generate new neurons even though it has a limited capacity. Possibly this capacity depends on sufficient neurotrophic growth factors. The neurotrophic factors include nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).||BDNF is important in neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity and memory, which along with the tendency of increased levels of BDNF in early stages of Alzheimer's indicate a connection. The increase of BDNF in early stages of Alzheimer's could be a reflection of compensation for the neurodegeneration. During the progression of Alzheimer's the level of BDNF is decreasing to a level of healthy elderly people.||NGF induces growth of neurons and maintains neuron proliferation interacting with other growth factors. Levels of NGF in serum, CSF or brain do not seem to differ from Alzheimer's patients to normal elderly patients but seem to vary between different brain regions. Finally the expression pattern of BDNF and NGF highly correlates with amyloid concentration (15).||Cluster of differentiation 163(CD-163) CD-163 is a scavenger receptor, which recognizes and uptakes macromolecules for the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex and its levels in an indication of monocyte-macrophage activation. The soluble form of the receptor is called sCD163 and is found in plasma. Plasma sCD163 levels are up-regulated in a large range of inflammatory diseases (16).||Hypothesis Patients with dementia have a deregulated concentration and/or activity of IGF-I, IGF-II, NGF, BDNF and sCD-163 in cerebrospinal fluid.||Purpose To define the concentration and biological activity of IGF-I, IGF-II, BDNF, NGF and sCD-163 in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum in patients with Alzheimer's compared with controls (patients with unspecified neurological symptoms or disease).||Method Study population All participating patients must be over the age of 18 years old. They are excluded from the study in case of acute bacterial neuro infection and acute bleeding The study population of this project will include all patients with established or suspected dementia, who will undergo a lumbar puncture at the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital as part of their diagnostic work-up.||Controls include patients with unspecified neurological symptoms or diseases who will undergo a lumbar puncture at the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital as part of their diagnostic work-up irrespective of this study.||The patients will receive information about the research project and will be asked to give their content to participation. The participation implies extraction of 2-3 ml extra of spinal fluid and an extra blood sample(10ml), which will be used for analysis of IGF system components and neurotrophic factors. Participants will not receive any form of payment, but can receive compensation for transportation.||At all times during the diagnostic work-up and consequently in the research project we will take the patients mental and physical condition into consideration. The research project will be carried out according to the Act on Processing of Personal Data.||At the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital, the Dementia Clinic use lumbar puncture as a diagnostic tool in approximately three patients per week. It is estimated that about 1/3 to 1/2 of these patients will end up with the diagnosis Alzheimer and these patients will ultimately be included in the project during a period of 36-40 weeks. Overall during the study period this will enable inclusion of 50-60 patients.||Analysis The spinal fluid and the serum will be analysed at the Medical Research Laboratory. The spinal fluid and blood samples will be deposited in a research biobank at Aarhus University Hospital. The plan is to carry out all the biochemical analyses at the same time when all samples are collected. In case of knew knowledge in the field we intend to deposit the samples for 5 years after this project. If the samples are to be used for another project The National Committee on Health Research Ethics and the Danish Data Protection Agency will demand an application once more.||The immunological concentrations of IGF-I and IGF-II are measured by validated in-house analyses. Furthermore, Aarhus University Hospital has a unique technique, whereby it is possible to measure the bioactivity of IGF-I and -II in the cerebrospinal fluid. The technique is based on a cell-based in-house bioassay developed in 2003. This method takes in to account that a large part of the IGF-I and IGF-II is bound to proteins and thereby to be considered biological inactive. The bioassay is able to measure the ability of both serum and cerebrospinal fluid to stimulate IGF-IR in vitro which makes the method much more specific. Pilot investigations from our group have shown that it is possible to measure the biological IGF-IR activity in cerebrospinal fluid. It has been proven that:||i) The biological IGF in vitro activity of cerebrospinal fluid primarily comes from IGF-II ii) The biological activity is far higher than expected as compared to simple measures of concentration owing to the low concentrations of IGF-binding proteins.||The immunological concentrations of the IGF-binding proteins will be measured by commercial or in-house developed immunoassays and ligand blotting techniques.||The concentrations of NGF, BDNF and sCD-163 in spinal fluid and serum will be analysed by already established techniques and the spinal fluid will be examined with spectrometry.||Clinical examination The clinical examination will be performed as a natural part of the examination of dementia. This includes medical history and an objective examination, CT scan and cognitive tests including MMSE (mini-mental state examination) and ACE (Adenbrooke´s Cognitive Examination). In the case of doubt a more extended examination will be performed by a neurophysiologist. Information from the clinical examination in form of medical record will be used to evaluate the possibility of dementia as diagnosis including the progression of the disease and thereby to evaluate the possible deregulated concentrations and/or activities of IGF-I, IGF-II, NGF, BDNF and sCD-163 in cerebrospinal fluid.||Power The bioactivity of IGF in cerebrospinal fluid in patients with dementia have not earlier been determined. Pilot data indicate that bioactivity from IGF-II in healthy people(n= 9) is 57 ± 13 ng/ml(mean ± SD). If the difference in a patient group is set to 26ng/ml ( ̴ 2 x SD) then inclusion of 10 persons per group give the project a power of 90% by use of ANOVA and a significant level of 5 %. It has therefore been chosen to include 15 patients in the project.||Statistic The program ANOVA will be used for statistical analyses. Parametric or non-parametric tests will be used depending of the normal distribution of data. In all statistical analysis a 5% level of significance will be used.||Perspective As earlier mentioned the costs of dementia already account for 1% of the world's GDP and the prevalence of dementia is expected to double within the next twenty years. The progressive nature of the disease means that estimated 43% of cases with dementia need a high level of care (equivalent to a nursing home). Therefore, it is obvious that prevention, delayed onset, slowed progression and potential curability are crucial factors for not only the well-being of patients and relatives but also for the economy of the health care systems. (2,17) This research project is based on the recent theory of dementia as a disease in the IGF-system, but as opposed to other studies we are able to measure concentrations as well as bioactivity. This will potentially open up for further knowledge about the dynamic of dementia and thereby potentially reveal further understanding of the pathogenesis and medical targets of dementia.||Ethical consideration Ethical considerations in general The tests performed on the patients involved in this research project are lumbar puncture and blood samples. Both of these tests will be performed as part of the diagnostic workup irrespective of this study.||It involves some risks to perform a lumbar puncture, which include post lumbar puncture headache with a incidence of 12 %, but is most common in younger patients. Most frequently, the headache has a short duration and it may be cured with application of a blood-patch. The use of a needle to the lumbar puncture can cause temporary lumbar pain and an accumulation Ethical considerations for patients with dementia The concerned patient group causes an extended ethical consideration. As mentioned earlier the symptoms of dementia causes memory loss, difficulty in finding the right words and understanding what people are saying. As such it is questionable whether the patients are able to make an independent decision on whether to participate in the project (6).||All of the dementia patients will have all the tests performed as part of the standard diagnostic work up for dementia. Therefore this study does not introduce any additional investigation defending the ethical aspect of this study. In consideration of the low risk involved in this project, the mild dementia forms and the high prevalence and seriousness of the disease we evaluate this project to be ethically acceptable. Furthermore it is of great importance to examine the pathogenesis and possible targets of dementia.||Aim Positive, negative as well as inconclusive results from this study will be published. The results will be the foundation of a research year report and an article for publication in an English written peer reviewed journal.",Dementia

NCT04154254,"Simultaneous measurements of PET and MR together as is recently became possible have allow spatial and temporal correlation between the two modalities opening a window of opportunities that was not available so far. The first practical advantage is because most neurological patients should go through both MRI and PET scans. Allowing both scans in the occasion significantly increase patient comfort. Furthermore, the simultaneous scans in contrast to sequential scans allow correlation between PET and MR informaiton without the concern of pathological brain modifications between the scans. Currently PET is performed combined with CT, which is superior to MR in the field of brain images. MR high soft tissue resolution as well as extra information it may provide regarding brain perfusion, diffusion, metabolic parameters etc., make the MR a far better modality for brain imaging than CT. In addition, the combined tool allow leveraging MR data to improve PET data quantification. PET issues such as motion correction, partial volume effect and correct localization of the tracer in the brain anatomy that cause PET image degradation and lower accuracy and robustness of PET quantitative parameters, can be solved by integrating MR data into the analysis. Several recently published articles have demonstrated different correction approaches for motion correction and partial volume effect showing an improvement in the PET images both visually and quantitatively . PET attenuation correction using MR data have also been studied, however this matter still need to be resolved. PET/MR for neurological conditions, in general, and specifically for conditions resulting in dementia, is a promising application with a large variety of research opportunities and its abilities need to be explored. Optimization of the acquisition protocols and even more so, the analysis and quantification protocols still need to be performed and will be the focus of this study.",Dementia
NCT02549872,"Dementia is a clinical syndrome with insidious onset that is difficult to diagnose in its earliest stages. Presentation to healthcare depends not only upon the rates of disease progression, but also on social support, recognition by clinicians, and patients' and carers' fear of diagnosis. Maintaining complete follow up in cohorts of patient with dementia is difficult, because patients with dementia are frequently lost to follow up.||Most patients with dementia in the UK use their local hospitals and general (family) practices throughout their illness. Linked electronic health records from primary care, hospital and death certificates records should therefore provide useful information about the diagnosis and prognosis of patients who develop dementia with minimal loss to follow-up rates and improved completeness of diagnosis.||Demonstrating that patients with recorded dementia have an earlier onset of typical symptoms, functional impairment and death than patients in the general population would support the veracity of diagnosed dementia recorded in electronic health records and its use as an outcome or exposure in cohort studies and for evaluating policy. Previous studies have found that dementia is poorly recorded in routine clinical practice in comparison to face-to-face studies, although this varies by setting and region. However, ascertainment may be improved by examining linked, longitudinal resources. Comparing the lifetime risk of dementia calculated from linked electronic health records with lifetime risks from other sources will also be a useful information to support the use of linked electronic health records in dementia research.||Electronic health records contain information on important health transitions in patients with dementia: from the earliest stage of the illness (depression, anxiety, memory complaints); the development of cognitive impairment that manifest as loss of capacity or missed appointments; and significant functional impairment, with admission to nursing homes or hospital admission. In this study, we will assess the validity of dementia diagnoses in linked primary care, hospital and death records, by examining the timing of important health transitions in patients with recorded dementia, and estimate the lifetime risk of recorded dementia in different age and sex groups.",Dementia
NCT00479271,"Service development for older people with dementia in India needs to take account of the fact that dementia tends to be a hidden problem. Thus, dementia is generally perceived to be part of normal ageing, and not a health condition, and families rarely present to health services, who are generally ignorant of most cases in their community. Health services are often ill-equipped to meet the needs of older persons. Health care, even primary care, is clinic-based; the older person must attend the clinic or hospital, often involving a long journey and waiting time. The assessment and treatment that they receive is orientated towards acute rather than chronic conditions. Thus, home-based interventions provide a practical alternative to clinic-based interventions for persons affected by dementia.||The probable cases of dementia will be identified with the help of key informants (doctors, priests, health workers, local leaders) in two of the most populated talukas of Goa (Bardez and Tiswadi,). All probable cases will be examined by a trained clinician to confirm the diagnosis of dementia. Cases will be randomized to receive the intervention or placed in a waiting list group who will receive the intervention after 6 months. The intervention will be delivered by a trained community Home Care Advisors (HCA), supported when required by the Principal Investigators and clinical consultants. The principal outcomes being evaluated are carer burden and mental health, behavioral problems in the person with dementia, and costs of illness.||Objectives||The project has two specific objectives:||To adapt and apply a flexible, stepped-care intervention designed to improve the awareness and knowledge of family caregivers regarding dementia, to maximise their caregiving resources and to improve their caregiving skills.|To evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the intervention in reducing carer burden, improving behaviour problems in elderly persons with dementia and reducing the costs of illness.||The intervention is designed to provide family caregivers with information about dementia syndrome, assistance in setting up local support groups with other caregivers, and training in strategies to better manage common behavioural problems in the home setting. This package would form the basis of the community intervention to be delivered in the proposed project. The third group of carers are medical personnel. Some patients with dementia suffer from behavioural or psychiatric problems which may improve considerably with the judicious use of psychotropic medication. The use of such medication requires the assessment and evaluation by a physician who has had basic training in the use of sedative medication in elderly people.||Baseline interview:||The baseline assessment of the demographic characteristics of the family, the background information about the Principal carer and the subject, costs of caring for the person with dementia, behavioural problems in the subject, perceived burden and the impact on the carers mental health. This information will be made available to the HCAs before they initiate the intervention.||Randomisation and Intervention: All subjects will be allocated a study number and randomised into two groups by a person at the central office. The person involved with the process of randomization will be blind to the status of the subject. Random number table will be used for the process. The HCA will then be informed of the family allotted to them for intervention.||After randomization the families will be divided into the following two groups:||Intervention and control||The medical intervention followed a treatment protocol.||Intervention||Following suitable training, the Home Care Advisors will apply a flexible home-care program tailored to the needs of the individual and the family. The components of the intervention will include:||Basic education about dementia (what is the disease, its course, its features etc)|Education about common behaviour problems and how they can be managed|Support to the carer, for example for an elderly carer living alone with the patient, in activities of daily living|Referral to specialists when behaviour problems are severe and warrant medication intervention (sedatives).||Instruments used for evaluation:||Socio demographic characteristics of the person with dementia and the caregiver|Everyday Abilities Scale for India (EASI): This questionnaire consisting of 12 questions, has been developed and widely used to test the functional abilities of daily living relevant to Indian subjects[11]|Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory (NPI) Questionnaire: This instrument consists of two parts; the first measures the severity of the problem behaviours associated with the condition on a scale of 1-3 (NPI- S); the second measures the perceived distress of the problem behaviours by the caregiver on a scale of 0-5 (NPI -D)[12].|Zarit Burden scale (ZBS): This is the most widely used scale in the studies of caregiver burden and encompasses the physical, emotional and financial burden as perceived by the caregiver[13].|General Health Questionnaire (GHQ): The 12 question GHQ is used to measure the psychological impact on the caregivers' mental health.||Control Group This group will be put on a waiting list to receive the intervention after 6 months. Families will be free to choose any health care they desire during the waiting period.||The broad outlines for the sessions for the intervention are as follows:||Understanding the Family Support system:||In this session the Home Care Advisor ( HCA ) will try and identify the principal carer, the family structure and the pattern of informal care provided to the person with dementia. They will try and identify stressors in the family like unemployment, alcoholism, financial constraints, etc. They will try to understand the possible ways to restructure the informal support system if required.||Explaining what is Dementia :||This session will first begin with accessing the carer's knowledge about the disease and help the carer understand the diagnosis and prognosis. The HCA will also give the family an overall idea of the prevalence of the disorder in the community.||Identifying and managing caregiver burnout:||The success of the stepped care model depends on identifying the stress in the carer and help them effectively manage it. A carer who is emotionally disturbed will not be in a position to gain new knowledge or learn new skills. In a nuclear family the caregiver is most likely to be the daughter in law who will have a number of other responsibilities which she carries out at the cost of her mental and physical health. Over the years her role becomes a routine and often a thankless job. The HCAs will try and create an environment which is supportive and sensitive to the needs of the carer.||Stress Management and Relaxation:||During this session the HCA will train the carer in stress management and relaxation techniques. If the non pharmacological methods do not work, they will advise and arrange for a visit to a psychiatrist for appropriate management.||Managing Problem Behaviours:||In this session the HCA will try and identify the problem behaviours like wandering, repetitive behaviours, hallucinations, screaming episodes, clinging, incontinence etc. They will help carers understand them and provide practical tips on management of problem behaviours at home. The case will be discussed with the counselor and the clinical consultants for their inputs.||Structuring a Day:||The HCA will give the carer tips on how to structure a day so as to make it easier for the subject and the carer to manage time and adjust to the changes taking place.||Nutrition:||Nutrition is often the major concern of the carers. The HCA will advise the carer on how to improve the nutrition of the subject and the family.||Management of Associated Disorders:||The Home Care advisors will be equipped with knowledge on the ailments that the person with dementia is likely to have. The subject being old may have a number of disorders like Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Ischemic Heart Disease, renal failure which are neglected as the disease progresses. The Home Care Advisors will try and find out if any of these conditions exist and advise the appropriate referral for the management so as to improve the quality of life.||Meeting with the Clinical Consultants and Counselor; The Home Care Advisors will meet the clinical consultants every week to discuss the progress of the case and the arrange for a visit whenever required. The Clinical consultants will also provide the appropriate advise for the management of the subject. They will meet the counselor every fortnightly to discuss the social and emotional aspects of the intervention.||Networking:||The HCAs will try and arrange a meeting of the carers and encourage them share their experiences with each other. Group sessions, film shows and lectures will be arranged at the meeting. They will be encouraged to meet and form support groups.",Dementia

NCT04620083,"Stage 1 - The development of the integrative learning program||Delphi technique was employed to gain consensus in the best possible therapeutic interventions for old people with dementia among members of the expert panel. The panel consisted of 8 health professionals including a gerontic care nurse, a registered nurse, an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, a Chinese medicine practitioner, a mindfulness practitioner, a nutritionist, and a neuroscientist. They all had more than 10 years of experience in their own disciplines.||A research team member explained to the experts individually the purpose of having the Panel and the importance of opinion sharing and idea exchange. Subsequent exchanges covered the conceptual framework, needs of people with dementia, components of the program operation and the intervention protocol. The experts did not meet but to provide their views through emails or audio recordings. Research members organized, collated the views, presented the aggregated views iteratively to each expert for consideration. The exchange on each topic terminated when all experts reached total agreement on their analysis and views were exhausted. Upon completion of each round, a summary was sent to all experts for accuracy checking. With this iterative approach, 12 rounds of exchange were necessitated to develop the complete integrative learning protocol.||To dispel any unrealistic expectations and facilitate learning, training in goal setting skills is needed in the integrative learning program. It was agreed among the experts that people with dementia have different needs and expectations, and various levels of difficulty and ability to meet them, be it basic (novice) or advanced (expert). Hence the Panel formulated a list of developmental needs which are necessary and essential for quality living of people with dementia. The goal of development of each need was also identified based on a novice-expert continuum and the conceptual framework of neuroplasticity and learning.||The Panel reviewed some common dementia management programs used in local institutions. Although these programs have included many contemporary treatment modalities, the results were not marked. The Panel also commented that the treatment modalities could have been sufficient but the piece-meal approach might undermine their efficacy. They concluded that an integrated and structured multi-modality approach together with emotion management should be adopted for the integrative learning program. The multi-modality treatments in the program were structured sessions that employed physical, cognitive, social, and emotional stimulations to intervene dementia. The modalities selected for the program included reality orientation, daily living skills training, reminiscence therapy, multisensory stimulation, fall prevention program, mindfulness activities, Meridian exercise, brain health program (Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar which referred to zither, go, calligraphy and painting) and health education. It was also agreed that case managers, caregivers, and participants were free to choose these treatments or could be assigned to a treatment regime on a 'mix and match' basis to suit their personality traits for improving their abilities to meet their own needs.||Based on the outcome of the above Delphi exercise, the experts brain-stormed the contents and details of each, followed by discussions before resolutions were made by consensus. Consensus was reached for the duration of a standard 3-day protocol and 5-day protocol. The 5-day protocol was an extended version of the 3-day one which allowed the participants to practice more in a designated time. Table 2 shows the 3-day integrative learning protocol. Interventions using the protocol were carried out by case managers who could be nurses, occupational therapists, or other health professionals. These case managers were independent of the research team. To ensure the competency of the case managers, each one had to attend a 3-day training workshop, with one day on theories, another day on practical training by 3 members of the Expert Panel (the gerontic care nurse, the nurse, and the occupational therapist) and the final day on quality assurance.||Stage 2 - Proof of concept: The evaluation of the implementation of the developed program by using a mixed method approach||i) Quantitative Method The study was held in three community care centers run by the same non-profit organization (NPO) and their routine and care provided were the same across their centers. Two types of services were provided in community care centers, residential and day care. The centers were located in different districts where residents were in public housing. Three centers were randomly drawn from the NPO by drawing lots. Eligible older people with dementia from the centers were recruited by convenience sampling. All participants continued with their daily routines and medications during the research period.||Having received consent from both the eligible older people and their relatives, the research team randomly allocated them to the control group (Con), Experimental 3-day normal group (Exp-N) and Experimental 5-day intensive group (Exp-I). For the control group, the participants received conventional therapy which included group activities for reality orientation, reminiscence therapy and activities organized by occupational therapists one hour a day, five days a week. In addition to conventional therapy, the two experimental groups also joined the integrative learning program. For consistency, Day 1 and 3 of the 3-day protocol were replicated as Day 4 and Day 5 of the 5-day protocol.||Allocation concealment was done to avoid selection bias while blinding was done to research assistant who performed data collection. Data were collected before the start of the program (T0) and upon its completion (T2 - at 6th month) for all 3 groups. For the two experimental groups, there was a mid-intervention evaluation (T1- at 3rd month). During the intervention, the trained case managers evaluated the conditions of the participants on a monthly basis until the completion of the program. They joined the monthly case conferences held by the respective centers listening to progress of the participants reported by center staff.||With the adoption of the mixed method approach, quantitative data were collected using 10 validated clinical test instruments while qualitative data were based on the verbatim transcripts of the monthly case conferences.||ii) Qualitative Method For the qualitative data, the verbatim transcripts of the case conferences were used for thematic analysis. These verbatim records were transcribed and coded for content analysis, based on the conceptual framework of the integrative learning program. The research assistant first identified words /segments in each transcript and then condensed them into meaningful units. Two panel members abstracted all the condensed meaning units into subthemes.",Dementia

NCT00385684,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the Low-Dose Opiate Therapy for Discomfort in Dementia (L-DOT) project was to determine whether low-dose opiates are effective and well tolerated for the treatment of pain (as manifest by discomfort) in patients with advanced dementia.||RESEARCH DESIGN: This study was a two-week double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of low-dose hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Lortab) for discomfort among veterans with a dementia, followed by six weeks of open-label therapy for patients who tolerated treatment during the first two weeks (eight weeks total treatment on study).||METHODOLOGY: After consent, patients over age 55 with dementia residing in a nursing home care unit (or at home who receive care) at Tuscaloosa VAMC who demonstrate significant discomfort (as measured by the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia - PAINAD) were randomized to one of two groups, using a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either hydrocodone/acetaminophen 2.5mg/250mg q8hrs scheduled with placebo q8hrs PRN or placebo q8hrs scheduled with hydrocodone/acetaminophen 2.5mg/250mg q8hrs PRN. After one week's treatment, patients were crossed over to the other (opposite) regimen, for a total of two weeks of blinded treatment. Patients who tolerated treatment with hydrocodone/acetaminophen were eligible for a six-week, open-label continuation phase. The primary outcome measure was pain/discomfort. Preliminary sample size calculations indicated that 42 patients (48 patients accounting for dropouts) would be needed to be enrolled over three years to detect a difference between treatments with power of .80 and two-tailed alpha of .05.||SIGNIFICANCE: There is evidence that pain is both under recognized and undertreated in long term care settings. This study hoped to make a significant contribution to the evidence base for a common and problematic situation among veterans with advanced dementia. Advances in pain and symptom control are central to the improvement of palliative care intervention for dementia patients. Low-dose opiates are the logical next category of analgesics to consider, but have been rarely studied for this purpose in this population.",Dementia
NCT02667951,"The illness course and symptoms of dementia is usually very long and characterized with behavioral, psychological and physical changes. Family caregivers' stresses change during the illness trajectory as well. Thus, the needs of the elderly persons with dementia and their family caregivers differ in different stage of dementia, and the services they require are multidimensional. According to the researchers' previous 2-year study, behavioral problem management and service utilization were found to be the most difficult and least prepared caregiving activities and the family caregiver's needs for assistance of these two caregiving activities differed in different stage of dementia.The purpose of this study is to compare the costs and effectiveness of two care models- home-based caregiver-training program model and routine care model for dementia elders in Taiwan.",Dementia
NCT02630446,"The in-home respite intervention group will receive in-home respite care also called ""Baluchonnage"". During that period, lasting at least five days (24/24hours), an internally trained or experienced care worker for persons with dementia takes over all caregiving tasks while the caregiver takes a break. This care worker also writes down his/her observations in a diary. The content of this diary enables the caregiver to validate their perceptions, provides strategies to deal with difficult situations, and let them feel that somebody can truly understand their daily challenges. The control group receives usual care (standard dementia care).||Participants of the in-home respite intervention group will be recruited by Baluchon staff when asking for a first or a new period of in-home respite care. First, Baluchon staff will describe the study to the dyads and ask them about their preparedness to participate. When they give their verbal consent contact information will be forwarded to the research team who will then contact them by phone. During this call a home visit will be planned to sign the informed consent and complete the baseline assessment. Participants in the control group will be recruited from several general practitioners spread over the different regions in Belgium. Potentially, in a later phase, control group participants will also be recruited via Memory Clinics in Belgium.||Similar to the recruitment of the intervention group, the physician will give some information about the study. When verbal consent to participate is given to the physician, caregivers will be contacted by phone by the research team to check eligibility. This will be done by listing different support strategies (including ""Baluchonnage"") and ask the caregiver if they would be interested to receive this type of support. Also previous use of Baluchonnage will be questioned because this is not allowed in the control group. When caregivers appear to be eligible the research team will plan a home visit to sign the informed consent and complete the baseline assessment.||Data collection of caregiver and care-recipient characteristics and research outcomes will be gathered at several assessment moments. The baseline assessment will be conducted during a home visit by a member of the research team. Background characteristics and baseline values of the research outcomes will be gathered during this assessment. For the intervention group this will be in the week preceding the respite period. For the control group this will take place after inclusion. A second assessment will be done in the intervention group two weeks after having the intervention. A third assessment moment will be done 6 months after inclusion and a last follow up assessment will be conducted after 12 months. To fulfill the assessments after the baseline assessment, caregivers will be contacted by telephone. All questionnaires will be available in Dutch and French for use in Belgium. When no valid translation of a certain questionnaire exists in Dutch or French for Belgium a back-forward translation method will be performed.||For caregivers the researchers will obtain the following background characteristics: age, gender, region, marital status, ethnicity, educational level, relationship with the care-recipient, employment status, living situation and time spent in caregiving. In both study groups the reason for (potential) use of respite will be asked. Earlier use of Baluchonnage will also be questioned to intervention group participants. Time spent in caregiving (measured twice) will be calculated using the RUD instrument (Resource Utilization in Dementia). For the care-recipient the following background characteristics will be collected at baseline: age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, region, National Registration Number, educational level, being on a waiting list for long-term nursing home placement, dementia-specific medication use, and severity of dementia. The National Registration Number of the person with dementia will be gathered. This will allow us to trace study participants in the IMA database (Intermutualistisch Agentschap) and gather information on resource use and date of placement in a nursing home over a longer time period than the trial. ADL (Activities of Daily Living) functioning will be measured using the Belgian Katz scale and severity of dementia with the Global Deterioration Scale. Both will be measured twice (baseline and after 6 months).||Sample size calculation is performed using SPSS SamplePower 3®. First, literature was searched to determine the needed effect size and standard deviation (SD) allowing to distinguish a statistical significant and clinical relevant difference in the primary outcome, i.e. burden. Based on the findings of a similar high quality intervention study an effect size of 0.4 was used in the analysis, which implies a difference of six points on the ZBI scale (Zarit Burden Interview), and a SD of 15. Also, an average drop-out rate of 20% was taken into account, a power of 80% and a significance level at 0.05. Based on these values a total of 124 caregiver/care-recipient dyads will be needed for the intervention group. To reduce selection-bias inherent to quasi-experimental studies an allocation ratio of 1:2 will be used to allow matching techniques. As a result 248 caregiver/care-recipient dyads will be needed in the control group.||When appropriate, i.e. if the intervention demonstrates an effect in the study endpoints, within-trial and modeled cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted in a separate economic evaluation plan. First the analysis will be performed from the perspective of the health care payer taking into account direct health care costs for the government's health care budget (RIZIV/INAMI) as well as patients' co-payment. Assuming that policy makers would consider reimbursement of in-home respite in the future the daily cost of Baluchonnage will thus be included in the analyses. Alongside the costs of Baluchonnage other costs of healthcare resource use including hospital and community care will be included. Additionally, also a full societal viewpoint will be undertaken not only including potential health care costs for the health care budget and patients, but also all other direct and indirect costs for caregivers and patients. Because in this viewpoint everyone affected by the intervention should be considered, caregiver time and costs (i.e. time spent in caregiving and productivity loss) as well as resource use and costs of other sectors (f.e. food delivery) should be included. Based on the KCE (Belgian Health Care Knowledge Center) guidelines for health economic evaluations in Belgium future costs will be discounted at 3% and future QALY's at 1.5%. Health utilities or QALY's of caregivers from both intervention arms will be derived from the Belgian public preference list based on scores on the EQ-5D (general utility instrument). Decision analytic modeling will be carried out to extrapolate effects of the intervention found in the trial to a longer time horizon. The model will be based on results from the trial as well as existing data from literature. Assumptions, hypotheses and sources of information will be represented in a transparent and clear way. Finally, the model will be validated by experts.||Data on resources used by the care-recipient of each study group will be obtained by an adapted version of the RUD instrument at baseline and after six months inclusion. This RUD instrument attempts to include all resource use including: health care resource use containing hospital resources (in-patient and out-patient attendances,…) and community care resources (general practitioner visits, nurse visits,…), caregiver and patient resources (time spent in caregiver,…), and resource use in other sectors (social worker visits, home help visits,…). Duration and frequency of the used services will be multiplied by each unit cost of the corresponding service. These unit costs will be obtained from the Belgian Reimbursement scheme using standard fees for regularly insured patients and other publicly available sources. Time spent in caregiving will be calculated at baseline and after six months using the recall method for which also a part of the RUD instrument will be utilized. Next, the amount of time spent in caregiving will be monetized using the opportunity cost method which estimates the value of lost informal caregiver benefits due to spending time on providing informal care. For informal caregivers not active on the labor market wage rates of similar people will be imputed. Basically, productivity loss should be included but given the average high age of informal caregivers it can be expected that productivity loss will have a negligible impact on costs because most of them are retired. Nevertheless, based on the results of mean age and employment status of the included caregivers the researchers will decide to whether or not include productivity loss as a cost. The costs of the intervention will be obtained from the current unit cost per day of Baluchonnage and multiplied by the amount of days the in-home respite care was delivered. Currently the daily cost of Baluchonnage is set at 350€/day covered by charity and 65€/day direct cost for the patient. Additional costs above the fixed daily tariff for Baluchonnage will also be included such as: travel expenses during the respite period and having a pet (5€ extra per day). Additionally, willingness to pay for one day of in-home respite care by Baluchon will be obtained from both study groups using the contingent valuation method (CVM). This method can be defined as a stated preference method for eliciting a monetary value to a health care program. In this trial a closed response format will be used. Finally, for use in the decision analytic model, costs of nursing home placement will be derived from the average daily cost for staying in a nursing home in Belgium at the time of completing secondary endpoint.||Descriptive statistics will be represented to draw a clear profile of the characteristics of study participants. Therefore the mean, percentages and the standard deviations of all continuous variables will be displayed. To determine possible baseline differences between the groups, mean values of baseline characteristics will be compared using independent sample t-tests for continuous variables if normally distributed or by performing Pearson's chi-square test for categorical variables. To help control for bias and confounding statistical techniques such as propensity score matching will be used. Propensity score matching can be seen as a tool to simulate a RCT setting. In this way the observed effect can be considered an unbiased estimate of the real effect. To investigate possible effects of the intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes, analysis of variance will be conducted if the outcome variables are normally distributed. A P-value of 0.05 will be considered as significant. All analyses will be based on intention to treat also taking drop-outs into account and avoiding overestimation of respite care effects. When the intervention is effective a cost-effectiveness analysis in a separate economic evaluation plan will be performed. Also ICERs (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio) will be calculated for the mean and upper and lower confidence levels of the costs and consequences. To explore uncertainty one-way-sensitivity analysis will be conducted around the ICER and illustrated in a Tornado diagram. Additionally, on all input variables a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, also called Monte Carlo analysis, will be conducted to test robustness of the model. These results will also be illustrated. Finally, the results and the willingness to pay threshold of the Belgian Health Care System will be presented in a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. To compare time to nursing home placement of persons who use respite care to those who don't, the researchers will use Kaplan-Meier survival curves to illustrate association between the comparison groups. By additionally conducting a log-rank test statistical difference between the groups in time to placement can be found.",Dementia
NCT01892579,"Over 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia, a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative condition, affecting also close to 15 million family caregivers (CG). A hallmark of the disease and one of the most significant challenges in dementia care is neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of which agitation is the most disabling and frequently occurring. It is associated with increased health care costs, reduced life quality, heightened caregiver burden, disease acceleration and nursing home placement. Treatment typically involves pharmacologic agents; however, these are at best modestly effective, carry serious risks including mortality, and may not reduce family distress. Recently issued position statements from medical organizations suggest nonpharmacologic strategies as first-line treatment. Nevertheless, nonpharmacological strategies for agitation remain understudied. We propose a Phase III efficacy trial to test a novel 8-session patient-centric intervention, the Customized Activity Program (CAP). We will test CAP using a randomized two-group parallel design of 250 people with dementia (PwD) and their CGs (dyads) who will be randomly assigned to CAP or a control intervention of equivalent in-home attention and social contact. CAP assesses PwDs' preserved capabilities, deficits, previous roles, habits, interests and home environment from which activities are developed to match PwD profiles. Families are trained to implement activities and modify them for future decline. A pilot phase with 60 dyads showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in agitation, with no adverse effects. Our primary study aim evaluates the effect of CAP at 3 months on agitation (Hypothesis: PwD in TAP will have lower caregiver rated agitation compared to the control intervention condition. Three secondary aims evaluate: 1) 6-month effects of TAP on agitation and quality of life in PwD (Hypothesis: PwD in CAP will manifest lower caregiver rated subscale frequency and severity scores at 6 months and better quality of life compared to PwD in the control intervention); 2) Immediate effects of CAP at 3 and 6 months on CG wellbeing, and time spent providing care (Hypothesis: CGs receiving CAP will report enhanced wellbeing and less time caregiving compared to the control intervention (3 and 6 months); and 3) Cost effectiveness of CAP expressed as an incremental cost outcome achieved in the form of CG burden reductions and willingness to pay for burden reductions (3 and 6 months; Hypothesis: CAP will be cost effective compared to the control intervention at each test occasion). Five exploratory aims will evaluate treatment effects on psychotropic medication use and other troublesome behaviors, if effects differ by cognitive status, if CGs receiving CAP use activities at 6 months and with what frequency, how time gained is spent, and if frequency/duration of treatment and activity use affects outcomes. If proven efficacious and cost effective, CAP has potential to transform clinical practice by offering a proven nonpharmacologic treatment for agitation of PwDs at home. This trial addresses a critical clinical need and public health priority identified by recent legislative activity.||Objectives||Our primary study aim evaluates the immediate effect of CAP on agitation at 3 months. Our hypothesis is that PwD receiving CAP will manifest a lower caregiver rated frequency and severity score on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-(NPI) subscales of agitation+aggression (21 items), compared to those in the control intervention.||Three secondary aims are to evaluate: 1) effects of CAP at 6 months on agitation and quality of life in patients. Hypothesis: Patients receiving CAP will manifest lower caregiver rated frequency and severity scores on the NPI-C agitation + aggression subscales and better quality of life in comparison to patients receiving the control intervention from baseline to 6 months; 2) effects of CAP at 3 and 6 months on CG wellbeing, (burden, skill acquisition, efficacy using activities), and time spent providing care. Hypothesis: Caregivers receiving CAP will report enhanced wellbeing and less time caregiving compared to those in the control intervention at 3 and at 6 months; and 3) cost effectiveness of CAP expressed as an incremental cost outcome achieved in the form of CG burden reductions and willingness to pay for burden reductions at 3 and 6 months. Hypothesis: CAP will be cost effective compared to the control intervention at each test occasion.||To further understand treatment effects and enhance translation, we propose exploratory aims to evaluate: 1) Impact of CAP on psychotropic medication use in treatment and control conditions at 3 and 6 months by comparing proportion of PwD who require dose increases or incident use of psychotropic medications (negative outcome) and proportion of PwD who reduce or eliminate medication use because agitation improved (positive outcome); 2) Whether treatment effect on agitation differs at 3 and 6 months by cognitive status; 3) Whether CAP reduces total NPI scores as rated by CGs at 3 and 6 months, 4) If at 6-months CGs receiving CAP are using prescribed activities and with what frequency; and how CGs use any personal time gained; and 5) Extent to which treatment receipt and enactment (frequency/duration of sessions and use of activities) affects NPI-C scores. If proven efficacious and cost effective, CAP has potential to transform the current paradigm of dementia care that relies primarily on the pharmacologic management of agitation. It will offer clinicians and families a proven nonpharmacologic approach to enhance quality of life that can be replicated, has reimbursement potential, and resonates with medical treatment guidelines and health care reform efforts aimed at reducing pharmacologic use and helping older adults be cared for at home.||Background||This proposed trial specifically builds upon and extends the pilot phase testing of the proposed intervention with 60 dyads (NIMH R21 grant # R21 MH069425). This pilot phase evaluated program acceptability, identified behaviors most responsive, and evaluated magnitude of change for NPS and CG burden. Dyads were interviewed at baseline, randomized to intervention or wait-list control, and then reassessed at 4-months. After 4-months, the wait-list control group received the intervention and was reevaluated at 8 months (within group comparison 4 to 8 months). Main outcomes: At 4-months, a statistically significant treatment effect was found for frequency of NPS overall (p=.010; Cohen's d=.72) using the 16-item Agitated Behavior Inventory for dementia. Specifically, 77% of CGs in treatment reported improvements in NPS compared to 40% in the wait-list group; 23% in treatment reported worsening of NPS compared to 60% in wait-lists. As untreated agitation worsens over time in a significant proportion of patients, our pilot data suggests that worsened agitation was less common in the intervention group; the intervention also appeared to help reduce likelihood of worsening in patients whose agitation was destined to worsen without treatment. It appears unlikely that the intervention caused an adverse effect of worsening. However, as this is a possibility, it is listed in the consent form as a possible risk. Reductions for intervention group also occurred for specific behaviors reflecting agitation and behaviors of most concern to this CG sample; shadowing (p=.003, Cohen's d=3.10), and repetitive questioning (p=.023, Cohen's d=1.22), with slight increases (worsening) found for the control group. As shown in Figure 2, we also found a statistically significant reduction in prevalence of caregivers reporting agitation (p=.014, Cohen's d=.75); 14.8% in treatment vs. 44.8% in control reported PwD agitation at 4 months. A similar pattern was found for argumentation (p=.010, Cohen's d=.77). Also, CG in treatment reported that PwD demonstrated better engagement (p=.029, Cohen's d=.61), more pleasure (p=.045, Cohen's d=.690), and improved ability to keep positively busy (p=.017, Cohen's d=.71). Equally significant were reductions in CG objective burden as measured by NIH REACH vigilance items hours ""doing things"" for PwD (p=.005, Cohen's d=1.14); and hours ""on duty"" (p=.001, Cohen's d=1.01) with those in intervention reporting 5 hours less and those in control reporting spending 3 hours more on duty. Control group participants demonstrated similar benefits from 4 to 8 months. Medication Use: Of 60 PwD, 78.3% were on an anti-dementia medication (cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine), 32% were on psychotropic medication for NPS, and 45% were on antidepressants at study entry. Use of medications did not impact the primary outcome (e.g., frequency of behavioral symptoms). In separate regression analyses, we entered baseline use/non-use of 3 medication-types (e.g., anti-depressant, other psychotropic medication, and anti-dementia medications) as a predictor and found no impact on treatment outcome or effect size. This shows that medications are common, yet NPS persist. It also suggests the importance of assuring that PwD are on a stabilized dose prior to entering a trial so that treatment effects are not confounded by medication use. Cognitive Status: We found no difference in treatment effect by cognitive status: both high (>10) and low (< 10) MMSE groups benefited similarly with regard to the reduction of behavioral frequency. However, the high MMSE group also showed a reduction in the number of behaviors occurring at 4 months (p=.028). Cost: We also calculated preliminary incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), expressed as cost to bring about one additional unit of benefit measured by CG hours per day ""doing things"" and hours per day ""being on duty"" and decision tree and Monte Carlo analyses tested robustness of economic models. Average intervention cost was $941.63 per dyad. ICER showed that CGs in treatment saved one extra hour per day ""doing things"" at a cost of $2.37 per day; and one extra hour per day ""being on duty"" at a cost of $1.10 per day. Monte Carlo showed that the intervention was cost-effective 79.2% of the time for ""doing things"" and 79.6% of the time for ""being on duty."" Varying cost assumptions did not change cost-effectiveness. In summary, this pilot phase demonstrated proof of concept; high acceptability by PwD and CGs, preliminary positive outcomes, preliminary cost effectiveness, and that benefits were for PwD agitation and no adverse events. It also provides guidance for trial design considerations including importance of assuring dyads on medications have a stabilized dose prior to study enrollment and evaluating relationship of cognitive status to outcomes. Our proposed trial advances this pilot phase by: a) testing efficacy with a larger, diverse sample that will be well characterized as to diagnosis, disease severity, and behaviors using standard clinical assessments, b) comparing CAP to a control intervention condition receiving equivalent attention and social contact, controlling for unknown effects of empathy, validation and attention provided in CAP; c) examining cost effectiveness prospectively from a societal perspective, and d) evaluating a broad range of other outcomes and moderators (dose, intensity, activity use) to support future translational efforts.",Dementia
NCT00596284,"Dementia is an illness that causes memory problems; changes in behavior; and difficulty with thinking, making decisions, and carrying out daily activities. Many people with dementia also have anxiety, and yet very little is known about effective treatment strategies for anxiety in this population. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that is commonly used to treat anxiety. CBT involves teaching patients skills to help them manage their anxiety, such as relaxation, changing their thoughts, and problem-solving. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of CBT in treating anxiety in older adults with dementia. In addition, the study will determine the effect of the treatment on patients' families and friends, and how families and friends may be able to help patients manage their anxiety. All study participants will name a family member or friend who will also participate in the study.||All participants in this study will answer a preliminary set of questions about anxiety and memory and will then complete a number of activities that involve learning and memory. These evaluations will take approximately 45 minutes. Participants who are selected to continue in the study will answer a second set of questions about mood, memory, concentration, and how they are doing in certain areas of life. These interview questions will take place during 2 sessions and will last a total of approximately 3 hours. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either enhanced usual care (EUC) or 8 to 10 sessions of CBT over a period of 10 to 12 weeks. Each CBT session will last about 1 hour and will include meeting with a study staff member to discuss anxiety and how to cope with it. Participants will also complete practice activities at home for about 20 minutes per day. EUC will consist of regular ongoing care from healthcare providers and phone assessments at 1-month and 2-month. Following the 6 month assessment, participants in EUC will be offered a Cognitive Behavior Workshop. Following in-person meetings, CBT participants will receive weekly phone calls for 3 months, followed by biweekly phone calls for the next 3 months.

NCT03354819,"Background:||Caring for people with dementia (PWD) poses many challenges which may cause high levels of caregiver stress. Mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) is a newly adopted psychosocial intervention through an integration of the mind and body to reduce stress of the participants. A systematic review was conducted with five studies (four RCTs and one quasi-experimental study) to investigate the effect of MBI in stress reduction in the family caregivers of PWD. Of these, three trials involving 144 participants were eligible for the meta-analysis. The result showed that the stress levels dropped significantly after an 8-week MBI in the family caregivers of PWD with a moderate aggregated effect size of 0.57 (95% CI [0.23, 0.92], overall effect Z= 3.25 at p= 0.001). While MBI's immediate effect was found, the long term effect was unclear. Besides a limited number of clinical trials and several limitations (such as poor study design and small sample size) were also identified in this review. It signifies that more studies are still required to examine the effects of MBI for family caregivers of PWD. Since MBI is a new intervention for stress management among the family caregivers of PWD, a feasibility study was conducted between 2016 and 2017. It found that the family caregivers could master the mindfulness skill after the mindfulness sessions with a low attrition rate of 3.8%. A modified Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) protocol was also validated in the study to fit the local need and address the limitations identified in previous studies.||Objective:||This study aims to investigate the effects of a modified MBCT for stress reduction in the family caregivers of PWD in Hong Kong.||Methods:||A prospective, single-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 76 family caregivers of PWD will be recruited and randomized to either the MBCT or the control groups. The MBI groups will receive a seven-week, group-based MBCT training whereas the control group will receive social interactions and routine education on dementia care program of a frequency and timing similar to those of the MBI group. The primary outcomes (stress) and secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, burden, quality of life, resilience) will be measured at immediate post-intervention (T1) and at 3 months follow up (T2) which will be compared with the baseline (T0). Mixed repeated measure MANOVA will be performed to assess the effects of time, group, and time-group interaction on all outcome measurements. Both per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be performed in order to find out more factors affecting the use and effectiveness of MBCT such as non-compliance and acceptability. To understand the therapeutic components and identify the strengths, limitations, and difficulties of the MBCT program, process evaluation will be conducted through focus group interviews with 15 participants from the MBI group. It is hypothesized that the MBCT group will have a significantly greater reduction of stress (primary outcome) and improvement in the secondary outcomes, namely anxiety, depression, burden, quality of life, and resilience at T1 and/or T2 than the control group.||Significance and Value:||Reducing the caregiving stress level can promote the well-being of the family caregivers to maintain their sustainability in terms of providing daily care for their family members with dementia for a longer period of time. Evidence shows a minimal and short term effects of other psychosocial interventions (such as respite care, mutual support group) for reducing caregivers' stress. On the other hand, the MBCT is found effective in stress reduction in other populations. This finding is also supported by a feasibility study of using the MBI in family caregivers of PWD. The results of this study may be able to provide us with evidence for using MBCT as a standard supportive intervention for the family caregivers of PWD.",Dementia

To examine the experience of Play Intervention by people with dementia, every alternate session will be videotaped for analysis.||Participants Participating centres will recruit and screen the eligibility of participants. After obtaining initial consent from the potential participants and their next of kin, his/her eligibility will be verified by the research assistant.||Participants are community dwelling, at the age of 65 or above with a medical confirmed diagnosis of any type of dementia (such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, etc.). He/she is at the stage of early to moderate dementia, at the stage of 4-6 screened by Global Deterioration Scale, and able to sit independently and participate in table activities; and physically stable.||There was no empirical research conducted on play intervention for dementia. As play intervention is regarded as a general cognitive stimulation activity in this study, sample size will be estimated with reference to related literature. Based on the systematic review of cognitive stimulation on cognitive functions, moderate effect size is found (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.25, 0.57), with the significance level of 0.05, power 0.8. Assuming of 20% attrition rate, 188 participants / group will be needed. This study is a feasibility study, and therefore only 10% of main study will be recruited, i.e. 19 participants/group, 38 participants in total.||Intervention The Play Intervention for Dementia was developed by Prof A. Ka Tat Tsang of the University of Toronto and his research team in 2013. It was based on the Strategies and Skills Learning and Development (SSLD) model, for promoting the quality of life of individuals with dementia. According to the SSLD model, human actions are driven by unmet needs. Maslow (1943) stated that people are motivated to achieve the needs, including physiological needs, safety needs, belonging needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs. People with dementia also have these needs, but they have difficulties to satisfy the needs because of the diminished cognitive abilities. Despite of the neuropathological changes caused by dementia, in play intervention, needs of belonging can be satisfied through social interaction in the group activities; needs of esteem can be contented through playing with toys independently in their own way and being respect throughout the process; and needs of self-actualization are fulfilled by realizing one's ability and creativity.||The PID programme has been piloted in Yee Hong Geriatric Centre, Toronto, Canada and Yan Oi Tong Day Care Centre of Hong Kong. Other than the intended outcomes (i.e. mood and quality of life), general improvement in cognitive functions (including attention, memory, quantitative ability, responsiveness, verbal expression) was noted by the family relatives and the researchers.||This study will replicate the intervention conducted in the previous trials. Each group will consist of 12 - 20 elderly, who will be further divided into three to four subgroups. They will participate in a 12 weekly session for 45 - 75 minutes. In each session, the participants will have warm up activities and play with toys with the other members in the subgroup. The toys have different characteristics that would stimulate gross/fine motor skills, proprioception, neuro-corporeal integration, sensory-motor coordination, cognitive capacity, and emotional expression. Examples of these toys are Jenga, Domino, Board Games, beach ball and plush toy. The session will conclude with playing a percussive music instrument. Play assistant (trained elderly volunteer) will facilitate the play intervention by setting up the play area, encouraging participation, offering assistance with minimal instructions, providing attention, and ensuring safety. They will transfer toys between subgroups every 8 - 10 minutes. It is because Mayer and Griffin (1990) found that people with dementia would show considerable interest on toys and engage in stimulus-seeking and exploring behavior within 10 minutes during unstructured active play. Play assistants will be trained by a Play Specialist. Participants will remain seated at the same table. The intervention fidelity will be monitored through the programme by a Play Specialist.||The Play Specialist possesses a professional qualification in one of the human service professions by licensing or regulatory authorities (e.g. registered nurse, registered social workers), and has successfully completed at least 30 hours of SSLD and Play Intervention training in a recognized or accredited programme.||Wait-list control condition The control group will receive standard care only until the last data collection was conducted in the experimental group. Standard care consists of medical and personal care, provision of basic needs, and activities carried out as usual.||Measurements Demographic data including age and gender, socioeconomic and educational background, medical history, living arrangement and marital status will be collected.||The global cognitive functions of the participants will be assessed with the Hong Kong version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment which has excellent inter-rater reliability and good discriminatory ability. It consists of 11 questions and takes around 15 minutes to complete.||Fuld Object Memory Evaluation (FOME) will be used for evaluating memory functions of encoding, storage, and recall across five recall trials and a delayed recall trial. This instrument has been validated in the Hong Kong Chinese population with good test-retest reliability, convergent validity, and discriminative power, and independent to educational background. Verbal fluency will be assessed by the Modified Fuld Verbal Fluency (MVFT). This instrument is modified from the original Fuld Verbal Fluency Test with cultural adaptation, which is a part of the FOME. The FOME and MVFT will take only 15 minutes to complete.||Semi-structured interview||At post-intervention, semi-structured interviews with staff will be conducted to explore their perception of play intervention and its effects on participants with the intervention group. Responsible programme workers or social workers from two study sites will be invited. The questions will be but not limited to:||Do you think play intervention can have a positive or negative effect on the participants?|Have you seen a change in participants' symptoms or well-being since they start receiving play intervention?||Video-taped The engagement of participants in the play intervention will be analyzed by watching the videotapes and filling in a log-sheet by the play assistants. In the log sheet, (a) total time spent, (b) names of all the activities participants engaged in and time spent on each toy, (c) level of engagement, (d) assistance participants needed, (e) participants' verbal and nonverbal reactions, and (f) barriers to engagement in activities will be recorded.||Data collection procedure A trained research assistant will be responsible for data collection and the semi-structured interview. He/she will be blinded to group allocation.||Ethical considerations Ethical approval will be sought from the University and participating organization. The participation will be entirely voluntary. Verbal explanation and information sheet will be given to the participants and their next of kin. Written consent will be sought from next of kin. Staff to be interviewed will also be explained about the study, and their informed consent will be sought too. Participants and their next-of-kin, and staff are free to withdraw anytime of the study without any penalty. Before each session, participates will be invited to join the play intervention. If he/she declined twice, his/her decision will be respected, but the play assistant and centre staff will invite again in the later session.||The play intervention is regarded safe and no side effect has been reported. However, if there is emotional upset or any other adverse reaction, the participant will be brought away from the venue and referred to the centre social worker for follow-up. The participant may choose to continue or withdraw from the next intervention session. The questions being asked by the research assistant during data collection are neutral and should not arouse any negative feeling. However, if emotional upset is observed, the research assistant will try to comfort the participant and refer to the social worker immediately. All the data collected will be kept confidential, while only the research team can retrieve. Individual identity would not be revealed in any published materials.||Data analysis strategies||The statistical software SPSS 23.0 will be used for data entry and analysis. As this study will adopt cluster randomization, characteristics of participants from the same centre may be correlated. The Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model will be used to conduct the repeated measurement analysis and correct the within cluster correlation. In all analysis, 5% significance level will be used. 95% Confident interval will be calculated.||The interviews will be audio-taped, transcribed and then subjected to thematic analysis by two researchers to elicit concisely described patterns and themes.",Dementia
NCT02269956,"Currently, basic training programs do not adequately teach nursing home (NH) staff to handle behavioral symptoms at mealtime that typically accompany dementia. When persons with dementia (PWD) exhibit mealtime symptoms (e.g. turning away of the head, pushing food away), these symptoms may be interpreted as lack of interest in eating, and feeding attempts ceased. This misinterpretation poses serious health risks to PWD including under-nutrition and increased risk for more aggressive medical treatment (e.g. feeding tube). The Aims of this study are to: 1) Identify the adaptive leadership challenges of NH staff for alleviating mealtime symptoms for PWD; 2) Determine NH staff evaluation of a dementia feeding skills training program that combines adaptive leadership approaches with technical approaches to mealtime symptoms; and 3) Conduct a 12-week feasibility study implementing this dementia feeding skills training program with NH staff, linking training to resident outcomes. Focus groups will be conducted in four NHs during which NH staff will describe adaptive challenges around: mealtime symptom recognition, communication patterns, typical responses to mealtime symptoms, and feelings when interventions are met with success or failure. Focus group interviews will be transcribed and content analysis conducted. Findings from the focus group interviews will be used to revise a dementia feeding skills program. The revised training program will be evaluated by NH staff to determine how NH staff perceives the coaching intervention, and if case scenarios are realistic and compatible with current workplace practices. The training program will be implemented in two skilled NHs over a five week period. NH staff outcomes include mealtime knowledge and self-efficacy. Through meal observations, NH staff will be assessed for time spent assisting with feeding and feeding skill behaviors; and PWD outcomes assessed by quantifying meal intake and aversive feeding behaviors. Findings from this study will describe adaptive leadership challenges for NH staff, revise and implement a training program teaching NH staff adaptive and technical interventions for alleviating mealtime symptoms for PWD in the NH setting.",Dementia

Randomization will be done at institutional level. Before randomization all patients in the participating nursing homes should be screened for dementia. This will be done by interviewing the registered nurses in the nursing homes using the Clinical dementia rating scale (CDR), Neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI-Q), Cornell scale for depression in dementia (CSDD). In addition information from the records will be used. Diagnosis of dementia will be made according to ICD-10 criteria, using a diagnostic algorithm that is evaluated in an ongoing nursing home study.||The nursing homes will be randomized in tree groups. Group A - Applying the VIPS- framework to develop Person Centred Care (PCC) and milieu therapy. The staff will be introduced to the model for applying the VIPS-framework to promote PCC in the daily care. A manual including films with information and examples will be distributed to all staff. Two auxiliary nurses are appointed as resource persons (RP) from each ward and one registered nurse (RN) from each nursing home will be trained as coach. The RPs and the leading registered nurse (RN) will plan and lead weekly consensus meetings with the staff in the ward using the VIPS-framework in discussions of concrete care situations. The researches will receive monthly written standard reports on attendance and contents of the consensus meetings from the RPs and can be contacted for support when necessary.||Group B - using Dementia Care Mapping (DCM) developing Person Centred Care and milieu therapy All staff and leaders in the nursing home will be introduced to the DCM- process in a presentation of the method and person centred care as a value base for DCM.

NCT04548089,"Background: Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to irreversible decline in one's cognitive and functional capacity, identity, and personhood. In Singapore, the number of persons with dementia is expected to soar to 187,000 by 2050. Hence, it is imperative to render comprehensive support to dementia sufferers, and especially their family caregivers. While local initiatives have raised public awareness and developed services for dementia care, they do not adequately address the psycho-socio-spiritual needs of family caregivers, as caregiving stress can greatly impede one's mental and emotional health. International research for dementia family caregivers has thus focused on developing multicomponent interventions that accentuate holistic support to promote healthy and sustainable caregiving.||Objective and Methods: Building on the established MCAT protocol (Ho et al., 2019), this study will adopt a wait-list randomized controlled trial design to test the efficacy of the refined version of Mindful-Compassion Art Therapy for Dementia Care (MCAT-DC) among 102 dementia family caregivers in Singapore. This study aims to: 1) develop a disease-specific version of MCAT for Dementia Care (MCAT-DC); 2) assess MCAT-DC's effectiveness in reducing caregiver stress and burden; 3) assess MCAT-DC's effectiveness for reducing caregivers' depressive symptoms and psychophysiological distress, while enhancing resilience, hope, spirituality, meaning and quality-of-life; and 4) assess the feasibility and acceptability of a standardized MCAT-DC protocol for large-scale implementation.||Significance: MCAT is an effective psycho-social-spiritual intervention for reducing stress and promoting holistic wellbeing among professional caregivers. It has received wide recognition and distinction among palliative care and research communities for its clinical innovation and effectiveness. Given the robust evidence on MCAT's positive impact on professional caregivers, it is anticipated that a refined version of MCAT will have similar, if not greater, benefits for family caregivers. The study findings will form new knowledge to advance both theory and practice for sustainable dementia family caregiving in Singapore and around the globe.",Dementia
NCT01394328,"It is well known that persons with dementia are at increased risk of developing delirium or acute confusional state. Further, current evidence suggests that delirium may worsen the prognosis of dementia, may alter the clinical course and trajectory of cognitive decline, and may be associated with substantially worse long-term outcomes. This study was a prospective cohort study design involving 165 hospitalized subjects with dementia who were 65 and older and included a three month follow up period. Aims for the study included: 1) to identify risk factors for DSD, and 2) to describe post-hospital outcomes and the trajectory of cognitive decline for DSD, which will justify the development of appropriate preventative and management strategies for delirium in patients with dementia. Delirium was assessed daily from admission to discharge and then at one and three month follow-ups. The potential risk factors being examined were 1) polypharmacy (central nervous system-active medications, number of medications, new medications added), 2) physical stressors (urinary tract infection, pain, dehydration), and 3) environmental stressors (bedrest, restraints, room changes).

NCT04289389,"Introduction There are currently no valid estimates of the occurrence of dementia in Norway. Estimates in use range from 70.000 to 104.000, with the highest estimate being 50 percent greater than the lowest. This makes it difficult to plan today's health services and estimate future needs.||To enable good planning of services to people with dementia, it is important that people with dementia to be evaluated and diagnosed for their illness. An early diagnosis seems to improve prognosis for the course of the disease. The proportion of undiagnosed people with dementia differs in the studies done on this and it is unclear which factors that may explain why many remain undiagnosed for their dementia disease.||The aim of this study is to provide knowledge that is crucial for planning good health and care services for older people with cognitive impairment and dementia. We will make valid estimates for the prevalence of dementia and the most common subtypes of them in Trøndelag and transfer these figures to estimates to Norway as a whole, by age, gender and severity of disease. We will investigate whether there are differences in dementia prevalence between males and females and educational groups. Furthermore, there will be made a survey of the proportion of people without dementia diagnosis among those with dementia, and examine the factors associated with a lack of diagnosis.||Method The data collection was a collaboration with the Health Survey in Nord-Trøndelag when this was carried out for the fourth time (HUNT4) in the period 2017-2019. All persons over the age of 70 living in 23 municipalities in Nord-Trøndelag and a district in Trondheim municipality (Trøndelag) were invited to an assessment at a field stations or by home visits (including institutionalized care), in the study parts called HUNT4 70+ and HUNT4 Trondheim 70+. The participants were offered a survey of cognition and function in everyday life. To get more information on cognitive function an interview with next of kin were made for participants with possible cognitive impairment.||A diagnostic work-up group of scientific and clinical experts (geriatrics, old age psychiatry or neurology) assessed the cases and made the research-based diagnosis. Standard diagnostic criteria according to the DSM-5 was applied for all the dementia diseases. The new estimates from Trøndelag will be used to estimate the occurrence of dementia in Norway as a whole, by age, sex and severity of dementia. Furthermore, the proportion of people without dementia diagnosis among those with dementia will be examined. Information about known dementia diagnosis from dementia assessment in municipality or specialist health service will be obtained by linking to registered data. The investigators will further investigate whether there are differences in dementia prevalence between males and females and educational groups and look at factors associated with a lack of diagnosis. Information from the earlier waves of HUNT (1-4) will be used to get information on health and risk factors for dementia from the study population.",Dementia
NCT03798327,"The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to study the impact of a new home based palliative care program on patients' symptoms, quality of life, satisfaction with care, completion of advance care planning documentation and receipt of care consistent with preferences. In addition, the study will examine the impact of this model of care on patient healthcare utilization, including hospitalization, emergency department utilization, and hospice use prior to death. The trial will also include patients' caregivers, in order to examine the impact of the intervention on caregiver burden and prevalence of depression.||Patients randomized to the intervention will be scheduled for an intake visit. This visit will be undertaken by the team's registered nurse and/or social worker, together with a community health worker, and other team members (advanced practice nurse, MD), depending on patients' needs. Visits will combine a combination of video-teleconferencing technology and in person visits. Following this visit, and in conjunction with the nurse practitioner and/or MD, a care plan will be developed to address areas of clinical need highlighted during the intake visit.||Patients in the intervention arm will receive ongoing monitoring and input (telephone-based, video-based, and in-person) from members of the clinical team, dependent on their identified needs. Patients' cases will be discussed at the weekly IDT meeting, as appropriate to the level of clinical need.

NCT04108000,"Cognitive impairment or dementia, usually vascular dementia or Alzheimer's, co-occur in approximately 38% of patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). When dementia is superimposed on ESRD, the risk for poor outcomes, including disability, hospitalization and death, sharply increases. Similarly, initiating dialysis in older adults with multiple comorbidities, including dementia, does not offer survival benefit. However, advance care planning (ACP) discussions with dialysis patients rarely occur. The reality of ESRD plus dementia is that most of these patients are likely to die or progress to advanced dementia without ever engaging in ACP discussions before the cognitive window of opportunity closes. Moreover, persons with dementia (regardless of their cognitive impairment level) are routinely excluded from clinical trials of ACP, largely because investigators assume that these people do not have the cognitive capability to appreciate the complexity of ACP. In an on-going study (""SPIRIT in Dementia"") the researchers carefully adapted SPIRIT for persons with mild to moderate dementia (mostly due to Alzheimer's) and their surrogates. In a sample of 23 dementia patients without complex multimorbidity and their surrogates, the researchers were able to conclude that meaningful ACP conversations were possible even for individuals with moderate dementia. Based on these findings, this supplement study will leverage the infrastructure of the parent SPIRIT in ESRD trial to pilot test the adapted SPIRIT intervention for patients with ESRD plus dementia as a model for determining whether patients with dementia superimposed on complex multimorbidity can fully participate in ACP discussion.||This purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial with 30 patient and caregiver dyads is to:||estimate the effects of the SPIRIT-dementia intervention on: (a) preparedness outcomes for end-of-life decision making (defined as dyad congruence on goals of care, patient decisional conflict, and surrogate decision-making confidence) 2-3 days post-intervention, and (b) care decisions (withdrawal from dialysis, Do-Not-Resuscitate order, hospice enrollment) assessed at 6 months post-intervention, or the patient's death, whichever occurs first,|estimate the effects of the SPIRIT-dementia intervention on surrogates' post-bereavement distress (anxiety and depression symptoms) at 1 month after the patient's death, and|explore the relationships among patients' cognitive status, decision-making capacity and their ability to express end-of-life wishes.",Dementia
NCT03167983,"Dementia is a disease that presents with deterioration in memory, thinking, behaviour and the ability to perform everyday activities. Worldwide 47.5 million people are affected and incidence of dementia is increasing. Dementia leads to disability and dependency among older people worldwide and thereby has a huge physical, psychological, social and economic impact on caregivers, families and society. Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia accounting for 60-70% of the cases; other forms include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia and Parkinsons disease with dementia. In AD, pathologic protein aggregates of amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated tangles of tau-protein which deposit as neurofibrillary tangles are typical features. This leads to neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by the innate immune system. The most important cells in this process are microglia cells, which represent the resident macrophages of the brain. Although microglia is able to remove extracellular amyloid beta, in later stages of the disease cells remain in a dystrophic state and cannot exert their beneficial functions. Microglia maturation and function is critically dependent on short-chain fatty acids produced by the gut microbiome and therefore highlights the microbiome as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in dementia.||The role of the commensal microbial population of the human body - especially the intestinal microbiome - in various diseases is emerging due to the development of advanced analysis techniques. Recently the concept of the gut brain-axis has been established. Several pathways including the autonomic nervous system, the enteric nervous system, the neuroendocrine system and the immune system allow a communication between gut and brain but may also be involved in disease development.||During ageing, the gut microbiome composition undergoes changes. A decrease in diversity, a loss of beneficial taxa and an increase of facultative pathogens has been described. Diet and the place of residence play an important role in the shaping of the microbiome. Aging is also associated with inflammation - often termed as ""inflammaging"" associated with an increase in gut permeability, mucosal inflammation and bacterial translocation.||Since the main risk factor for developing dementia, especially AD, is aging, it is very likely that the gut-brain axis is critically involved in dementia development.||Animal studies so far suggest that AD is associated with changes in the gut microbiome composition with a decrease in beneficial, anti-inflammatory genera. Furthermore, genetic alterations in amyloid genes can influence microbiome composition in mice, pointing towards a vicious cycle in AD development.||In humans, so far no studies on the gut microbiome composition in patients with dementia have been published. However, there is evidence that the composition of the microbiome in subgingival plaques is altered in dementia and associated with cognitive function.",Dementia

NCT02395731,"The demonstration project has 3 major tasks which will be implemented in concurrent, iterative phases: (1) implement MIND-Plus in 2 community-based health service agencies to rapidly improve the ability of 600 community-living dually eligible older adults with AD in the Baltimore region to remain at home while improving care quality, enhancing quality of life, and reducing total health care costs associated with institutional care or hospitalization; (2) develop a replicable model for nationwide diffusion of the MIND program through a web-based certification package designed to prepare for implementation, build work-force capacity through training certification modules, and provide automated self-monitoring and quality improvement tools; and (3) develop and test a detailed payment model that takes a blended approach and includes provider care management fees with provider performance incentives from division of shared savings.||The investigators hypothesize that the MIND-Plus dementia care coordination program will (1) rapidly improve health & care quality and reduce total health care costs among Medicare-Medicaid dually eligible community-living older adults with AD, (2) drive health care system transformation by creating a new CMS financed benefit that would shift the hub of dementia care coordination to well-trained, dementia competent, interdisciplinary teams based in community health agencies, (3) achieve a sustainable payment model that produces significant net savings and incentives provider performance. This ""shovel ready"" community-based model is expected to improve outcomes within 6 months and save an estimated net-saving of $12.5 million by over 3 years.",Dementia
NCT01357564,"This study tests the efficacy of a transformative patient-centric intervention designed to reduce the burden of NPS in Veterans with dementia who live at home with family caregivers. The innovative intervention, the Tailored Activity Program (TAP-VA), involves 8 sessions over 4 months in Veterans' homes. An occupational therapist conducts a systematic assessment to identify a Veteran's preserved capabilities and deficit areas, and previous roles, habits and interests from which to develop and introduce activities tailored to the Veteran's profile. Family caregivers are then trained to incorporate tailored activities into daily care routines. The intervention was pilot tested in an NIMH funded study with 60 community-living individuals with dementia. Findings from this pilot showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in NPS, specifically agitation and less time being on ""duty"" by family caregivers. Results of this pilot phase support moving forward with a full-scale Phase III efficacy trial. The investigators tested TAP-VA in a randomized two-group parallel design in which 160 racially and ethnically diverse Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers (dyads) were randomly assigned to receive TAP-VA or an attention control group. All dyads were evaluated at baseline and 4-months (main trial endpoint), and then reassessed at 8-months to evaluate long-term treatment effects (baseline to 8 months), including continued activity use, caregiver well-being, and costs.",Dementia
NCT03578861,"Around the world, caring relatives play the most important role in care of people with dementia (PwD) at home. In 2012 approximately 24.3 million people were affected by dementia worldwide and more than 1.5 million people are suffering from dementia in Germany. These numbers are expected to rise up significantly within the next 20 years. As a direct consequence of dementia-specific care, caring relatives are often heavily burdened. Some common symptoms of dementia include progressive and frequent memory loss as well as confusion, personality change and apathy. Furthermore, the abilities for walking and standing activities get weaker especially because of balance dysfunctions. These symptoms lead to a loss of ability to perform everyday tasks for the PwD and an increased risk of falling. Among others, this situation can destruct the stability of care arrangement at home and lead to a transfer of the PwD to long term care but most PwD have the wish to stay at home if possible.||Respite care (RC) is a common used short term inpatient service with the primary aim to support home care arrangements for PwD and their caring relatives. To reach this aim, caring relatives can bring their cared persons to a specialized RC care facility, where they can stay about 1 to 8 weeks. During this time, RC facilities could develop and implement individual tailored support interventions focused on the concerned PwD and caring relatives to reach a stabilization of their caring situation at home.||However, there are no evaluated or standardized programs for the support of PwD and caring relatives in the RC setting till today. In particular, this is a serious problem because there is an increasing number of RC residents who suffer from cognitive impairments or dementia.||An individual tailored, specific RC concept for people with dementia and their caring relatives could focus on their special needs and help to stabilize the caring situation effectively.||In an actual Cochrane review it was pointed out that there is a high demand for mobility based rehabilitation programs for PwD with significant positive effects related to mobility based ADL abilities. Mobility based interventions generate the highest effects of all other interventions, including medication, related to ADL abilities of PwD and with respect to their level of independence in general. However, few standardized and detailed described programs for mobility based interventions focused on PwD exist until today. There are no structured mobility based rehabilitation programs to support PwD and caring relatives in the RC setting. Another Cochrane review pointed out that situation does not only apply for Germany but even in international context. With scope to caring relatives, professional dementia-specific counseling services have positive effects on the psychological and psychosomatic symptoms, coping with stress and managing behavioral disturbances. To date, there is no dementia-specific counseling programs specialized to the RC setting, though RC facilities have the chance to reach caring relatives, which are often no more accessible for other dementia support services, because of their overburdened situation and thereby very little time resources. However, especially these caring relatives have a strong need for information about dementia and related support services.||Primary aim of the DESKK Study is the development, test and evaluation of a dementia specific RC concept with scope on mobility (PwD) and counseling (caring relatives) referred to its usability and implementation requirements. Furthermore an explorative outcome evaluation will be performed to describe intervention processes of this dementia specific concept focused on RC staff, PwD and caring relatives. To reach these study aims, following research questions are intended to be answered:||What kind of intervention parts and RC structures/processes are relevant for the development of a dementia specific RC concept focused on an ADL based mobility program for PwD and a counseling program for caring relatives?|How can the DESKK mobility and counseling program be developed and implemented suitable for the respite care setting?|What changes occur during the DESKK mobility and counseling intervention related to the PwD and caring relatives?|How is the DESKK concept subjective rated by the caring relatives and what changes related to burden (CR) and mobility (PwD) occurred after ending the RC stay (Follow-Up).",Dementia

The researchers will review and report the process during the trial covering participant enrolment, consent, eligibility and allocation to trial groups, policies to protect participants, including reporting of harm and completeness, accuracy and timeliness of data collection.||STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES. Participants will be recruited over a period of three months by physicians (primary care, psychiatry, neurology, and geriatrics), neuropsychologists and dementia and mental health nurses. Participants will not receive financial reimbursement for taking part in this trial. Participants will be identified from people with self- perceived cognitive impairment or caregiver´s perception of cognitive impairment that has been present for more than six months and who meet all the study eligibility criteria (listed in section Eligibility). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) will be used to screen PMCI/MD at recruitment. Participants can be under primary care services as well as secondary care services. Participants will also be identified from patient databases such as those integrated in the network.||DATA DICTIONARY. All variables collected in this study are listed and described in an electronic case report form, with associated guidelines, to ensure consistency in all gathered data. The following data will be collected in this trial:||Sociodemographical data.|Medical history - PMCI/MD only.|Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD Scale) (1-3).|European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EuroQoL-5D-5L) (4,5).|Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-12) (6,7).|Treatment adherence: Pill/dose count (8-10) and Morisky-Green Test (11).|Functional decline: Lawton - Brody Instrumental Activities Of Daily Living Scale (IADL) (12).|Service Utilisation: Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) (13,14).|Data from the TV-AssistDem application focusing on User-behaviour and usage of core services.|Usability Evaluation: System Usability Scale (SUS) (15,16).||SAMPLE SIZE ASSESSMENT. The main outcome measure is the total score of the QoL-AD, which ranges from 13 to 52. According to recent studies (17,18) , the standard deviation of the total score of the QoL-AD is 7. For a minimum important clinical difference of 2.77 on the total QoL-AD score, with a standard deviation of 7, the effect size is 0.39.||To compare two groups (Intervention and Control) using a two- sample, two-sided t-test with a 5% statistical significance level, the minimum number of evaluable PMCI/MDs required in each group is 100 (200 overall), to give a power of 80%. If there would be a drop-out rate of 20% of the PMCI/MDs then the number of PMCI/MDs registered on the study would need to be 120 in each group (240 overall).||STATISTICS ANALYSIS PLAN. The flow of individuals will be shown schematically with counts and percentages in a CONSORT diagram. The analysis will be made following an intention-to-treat procedure. All variables collected will be summarized by group and by site at baseline and at final follow-up. Statistics considered for presentation for continuous measures in summary tables will be the mean, minima and maxima, and standard deviation, and if the criteria of normality are not met, the median and the first and third quartiles. Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. The baseline variables of the experimental group and the control group will be compared using the Chi-Square test for categorical variables and analysis of covariance for continuous variables.||For the primary outcome, a Linear Mixed Model analyses will be carried out as this approach is optimal to include subjects with missing data. First, an unadjusted analysis will be carried out and secondarily, in case that potentially confusing factors differ between the experimental group and the control group, despite the randomization, a supplementary multivariate analysis will be carried out. For secondary outcomes a Linear Mixed Model and Generalized Mixed Model analysis will be used for continuous and categorical variables respectively. Analysis will be two-tailed and alpha level set at 0.05.||ECONOMIC ANALYSIS. A cost-effectiveness and/or cost-utility analysis from a Health Service perspective (financer perspective) will be performed. The time horizon is two years and will include only direct costs. This refers to direct health costs (medication and healthcare use of services including outpatient and emergencies visits and hospital admissions). The Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) will be calculated to estimate the benefit calculating the utility improvement measure by EuroQoL-5D-5L.||USER-BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS AND USABILITY EVALUATION. Data on various platform usage variables will be collected for the intervention group. Regression analysis will be used to assess the relationship between the primary and secondary outcome variables and the usage variables in order to indicate which aspects of the computer platform use most affect the outcomes. The results of the usability tests will be analyzed using statistical methods to quantify the error rate, effectiveness and learning curve of the TV-AssistDem platform.||PLAN FOR MISSING DATA. Each researcher is responsible for ensuring that any missing data will be reported as missing in the study database. Procedures can sometimes be considered when using statistical methods that fail in the presence of any missing values, or when in the case of multiple-predictor statistical models all the data for an individual would be omitted because of a missing value in one of the predictors.

NCT03260608,"Dementias are neurodegenerative syndromes typical of the elderly population and cause a high degree of incapacity and dependence of the patient in relation to the care of others. Caregivers of patients with dementia, especially those belonging to the same family, suffer from a high degree of overload, and are often affected by impairments in their own health. Previous studies have shown that telephone interventions for the assistance and guidance of these individuals have a positive impact on their own quality of life as well as on the family members under their care. Measures like this can also optimize specialized services and facilitate the search for medical help when needed.||In this way, the present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a psychoeducation and support protocol, performed by telephone, to assist caregivers of patients with dementia under specialized outpatient follow-up.||Patients will be divided into two groups.

NCT04131374,"Background: Over 90% of people living with dementia (PLWD) experience behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) including apathy, depression, sleep disruptions, wandering, repetitive behaviours and anxiety. BPSD can also result in poor quality of life, burden for caregivers, and an increased risk for physical abuse of PLWD. Incorporating the family caregiver into the plan of care may improve satisfaction and lower the burden associated with providing care for PLWD in a nursing home. New evidence suggests limited benefits of pharmacological interventions and increased risks for adverse events for PLWD. Results from systematic reviews suggest that Reminiscence Therapy (RT) has positive outcomes for people with dementia, such as elevated mood, improved cognition and enhanced behaviours. An additional systematic review indicates there are significant benefits of using information communication technology (ICT) for RT interventions. Virtual reality (VR) is emerging as a promising non-pharmacological approach for reducing symptoms of dementia and allows for tailoring of technological intervention to the user.

NCT03943641,"To date, no dementia drugs have shown a disease-modifying effect in clinical trials. It is now understood that the pathology underlying Alzheimer's disease is present decades before symptoms become apparent. Starting an intervention only when a patient develops cognitive symptoms, and therefore when there is substantial disease burden, may reduce the chance of any disease-modifying effect. Instead, targeting interventions earlier, when the pathological burden is lower, may increase the likelihood of preventing or delaying dementia onset.||Consequently, there is a need for a method that identifies patients who are at an increased risk of developing dementia. This requires the development of a risk prediction model, which utilises multiple predictors in combination to produce individualised estimates of the risk of developing dementia risk over time.||An ideal risk prediction model for a population-based application would need to use predictors that are already available to, or readily obtainable by, general practitioners (GPs). Such a predictive tool could be used as a low cost, scalable method of recruiting an 'at risk' group of participants to future trials of risk modification strategies or preventative therapies. Once an effective disease-modifying intervention is identified, clinicians could use the same model to identify at-risk patients who may benefit most from undergoing the intervention.||An ideal dementia risk prediction tool would contain only information that is readily available to, or easily obtainable by, clinicians such as General Practitioners (GPs).||The investigators aim to develop two 10-year risk prediction models: one to predict all-cause dementia and one to predict Alzheimer's disease dementia, in UK adults aged 60-79 years, using only predictors that are routinely available to GPs.

Every patient will receive strength training using dumbbells, butterfly machine and vertical leg press machine for four weeks. Outcome measures including self care ability, cognitive function, MCP-1, BDNF and IGF-1 levels, and the degree of depression will be recorded before and after the training. In the second year, the investigators also designed to recruit 31 patients with mild dementia. These participants will instead receive aerobic training using stationary bicycle for four weeks. The same outcome measures will be tested as in the first year. Via the results of this study, whether strength training or aerobic training could bring better benefits in dementia patient can thus be elucidated.",Dementia
NCT02397980,"This multicenter, randomized trial will be conducted with 80 dementia caregivers, who will be randomized into two groups. One group consists of 40 participants who will receive behavioral intervention and 40 who will not receive intervention (waitlist control). The waitlist control group will be also provided the same intervention after the intervention group has completed the intervention. The behavioral intervention consists of 90-min-session a day with an interval of two weeks for 2 months. The intervention program includes not only the knowledge of dementia and how to manage behavioral problems of patients with dementia but also individual psychological counselling about caregiver's distress. The primary outcome measures are the changes in scores of Zaret's Burden Inventory and Philadelphia Geriatric Center for Moral Scale (PGCMS). Secondary outcomes are changes in scores of neuropsychiatric inventory and Korean -instrumental Activities of Daily Living of patients as well as depression scores of caregivers.",Dementia
NCT03937297,"Dementia is a disabling chronic condition affecting over 47 million people worldwide. Chinese population will be one of the main driver in the increasing trend in dementia prevalence. Accumulating evidence suggests effectiveness of certain non-drug interventions in maintaining cognition and quality of life in people with mild-to-moderate dementia, such as cognitive stimulation therapy (CST). These interventions are designed and tested in western populations with issues of cultural adaptation when applied in Chinese. Culturally appropriate and effective interventions for Chinese people with mild-to-moderate dementia are lacking.||The Six Arts stem from ancient Confucian philosophy, which promotes behaviours that can impact on multiple mind-body functional domains. These domains correspond to social, physical, and cognitive activities with theoretical basis and empirical evidence of benefits in cognition, functioning, and quality of life. Using the Six Arts as a cultural framework, a group-based multimodal intervention has been developed in Hong Kong for Chinese people with mild-to-moderate dementia.||The study will recruit 240 people with mild-to-moderate dementia in a randomized single-blind controlled trial consisting of three groups: (1) Six Arts intervention; (2) CST; and (3) usual care. Neuropsychological and clinical assessments will be conducted at randomization (T0/baseline) and upon completion of the 24-session, twice-weekly intervention (T1/3 months), by an assessor unaware of group membership. Focus groups will be conducted after completion of the intervention in 60 family caregivers who have observed at least one session of the Six Arts intervention or CST.||This study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of two intervention protocols with potentials for large-scale implementation in the growing Chinese population with dementia.",Dementia
NCT04630912,"The study will involve a small case series of up to six participants (three people with dementia and up to three caregivers depending on the person with dementia's preference), meaning the PI will be able to track on an individual level. Individuals who express interest will be contacted by the student via telephone or email. The PI will provide information pertaining to all aspects of study participation prior to recruitment.||Procedure & Intervention Content,||Part 1:||As part of the practitioner-researcher model, the PI will be delivering the ACT intervention following the completion of ACT training and pre-adaptational work for use with people with dementia. Verbal information may be supported by visual aids and written information to support retention and reminders of any between-session tasks. Although there is no specific protocol for ACT with dementia, a published ACT protocol, 'Better Living with Illness' (Brassington et al., 2016), will be used flexibly to guide the intervention.||The HSCED will include baseline and intervention phases. As participants will be recruited to the study at different times, baseline lengths will vary. This may strengthen the design by reducing the possibility of any observed changes being attributed to time-based effects (after a duration of monitoring).||The intervention will be delivered on an individual basis for up to 90-minute, weekly sessions. There will be a standard number of up to 12, but this will be reviewed at session six. At the beginning of each therapy session, the PI will offer introductions, provide reminders about the purpose of the study, confidentiality and its limits and gain verbal consent to proceed. Reported changes will also be captured at the beginning of each session, for example, 'checking-in' with participants and inviting them to share any reflections on therapy or changes they have noticed between sessions.||ACT fidelity will be assessed by the PI using the ACT Fidelity Measure (O'Neill, Latchford, McCracken & Graham, 2019). The ACT-FM is a 25-item coding system that captures depth and frequency of coverage of major ACT components and non-adherent components through four main areas within ACT; Therapist Stance, Open Response Style, Aware Response Style and Engaged Response Style.||At baseline (first session), last session and at 1 and 3-month follow-ups, participants (people with dementia) will complete self-report measures of anxiety (with the GAD-7) and depression (with the PHQ-9). At each session and at 1 and 3 month follow-ups, they will also complete measures of wellbeing (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale; SWEMWS), personal problems (Personal Questionnaire; PQ), psychological flexibility (Comprehensive Assessment of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Processes; CompACT-SF) and a measure of relational process (Session Rating Scale; SRS) to support their rich case record and provide data on the quality of the therapeutic alliance as a rival hypothesis for interventional change. It will be considered whether any of these measures could be completed by the PI from session recordings to try to reduce participant burden.||Part 2:||One week post-therapy, a semi-structured Change Interview will be conducted with participants and their caregivers together by an independent researcher to obtain their views about their experience of therapy, including change processes, consideration of what they attribute change to and what may have enabled or hindered change, if change occurred. These will likely take place at a room at one of the universities, location convenient for the participant or remotely via telephone or videocall. The interviews will be audio-recorded with a digital dictation device for later transcription by the student to contribute to the rich case record of each participant.||Practical Aspects:||Due to COVID-19, there will be two options for intervention delivery: (A) face-to-face as planned; or (B) remotely via telephone or videocall.||In Option A, the PI will offer flexibility regarding the location and time of the ACT intervention. It is understood that people with dementia are often marginalised, therefore the PI will make efforts to travel to them and make any reasonable adjustments. Participants may be telephoned to prompt or remind them of the therapy start time if necessary. Location options will include participants' homes, NHS site or University premises, depending on the preferences of the participant. All therapy sessions will be conducted in accordance with the University of Nottingham's (UoN) and respective NHS Trust's Lone Working Policies. The attendance of caregivers at therapy sessions will be negotiated with the participant. There is an acknowledgement of caregivers' likely role in transporting and accompanying participants to their appointments. All attendees (PI, participant and caregiver) will be required to wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and adhere to social distancing measures in accordance with COVID-19 restrictions.||In Option B, the PI will negotiate an appropriate appointment time (between 9am-5pm on weekdays) to conduct the intervention. Again, the attendance of caregivers at therapy sessions will be negotiated with the participant. There is an acknowledgement that caregivers may prompt or support clients with between session tasks. Caregivers will also be invited to Change Interviews following the completion of therapy. The Change Interviews will involve asking participants about their experience of the therapy, what they found helpful and less helpful, any improvements that could be made and asking both participants and carers whether they have noted any changes in wellbeing or functional ability over the intervention period.||All therapy sessions will be audio-recorded with an encrypted, digital dictation device for storage and later transcription for quality and ACT fidelity checks. This will be clarified on the Participant Information Sheet and at the beginning of each therapy session. The PI will also take written notes.",Dementia
NCT03483896,"Exposure to sufficient daylight indoors is a novel and potentially effective nonpharmacological treatment option for reducing depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms for people living with dementia in long term care facilities. However, there are currently no minimum requirements for daylight access in care facilities. In urban settings, it is common for residents to spend the majority of the day indoors, illuminated by electrical light sources that deliver light with significantly lower intensities and reduced spectrum compared with daylight.||A 12-week pilot study was conducted in 8 dementia care facilities involving (n = 83) participants addressing the hypothesis that an intervention increasing indoor exposure to daylight will reduce depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. At 4 facilities, staff was enlisted to increase daylight exposure by taking participants to a perimeter room with daylight exposure for socialization in the morning (8:00 - 10:00 AM) each day. At the other 4 facilities, a control group were taken to a similar sized area without daylight for socialization under typical electrical lighting conditions. Outcome measures for depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms were taken at the beginning and end of the 12-week study.",Dementia
NCT02845830,"Introduction In the Czech Republic, there are about 120 -150 thousand people living with dementia. The most common form of dementia is the Alzheimer's disease, which constitutes about 50 -70 % of all dementia cases and its prevalence in the population is on the rise with the increasing proportion of population over 60 years of age. In 2012, patients with dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD), who were treated with this disease for the first time, comprised more than 28 % of total number of outpatients treated for dementia. Number of treated patients with dementia increased by 5 % between years 2012 and 2013. According to the World Health Organisation, dementia has become a priority for the health care system. Maintaining or improving the quality of life (QoL) amongst the elderly with dementia is currently one of the key aims of health care. Foreign literature points out the fact that QoL amongst the elderly with dementia (EwD) has not yet been sufficiently examined, particularly in the long-term perspective. This may stem from the fact that QoL amongst the EwD was examined in relation to a relatively limited group of factors. We see an attempt to define each of the factors affecting the quality of life amongst EwD. Among factors with direct impact on the assessment of QoL amongst the EwD is attitude to aging. Social and interpersonal factors also play an important role in the subjective perception of QoL. This includes a decreased ability to communicate which deepens the social isolation at an early-phase dementia, which is reflected negatively in the subjectively perceived QoL amongst EwD. QoL amongst the elderly with slight cognitive impairment and dementia is significantly affected by fear of falling. Other factors include dignity, chronic pain and depression. Another major factor connected with age is frailty, which impairs the ability of the organism to react to stressors and affects QoL. For this reason the relation between frailness and cognitive impairment is studied today. One of the factors affecting QoL amongst EwD is also functional condition. The EwD need an increased amount of supervision and help with activity daily living (ADL) and this dependence negatively affects their QoL. The relation between comorbidity and QoL amongst EwD has not been clearly proved in earlier studies. However, an important aspect of comorbidity is its relation to QoL and health status of the elderly. An early-phase dementia is primarily characterised by memory impairment with a relatively maintained self-sufficiency requiring only minor attention and help by family caregivers. Older adults are usually aware of their condition which may cause depression, anxiety and insecurity. Self-assessment of QoL amongst people with early-phase dementia is supported in the latest research abroad. Cross-sectional studies but a mainly long-term observation of QoL trajectory is important in individuals with dementia. When investigating the trajectory of QoL amongst EwD, it is necessary to examine the factors which might affect QoL. So far, there have been few longitudinal studies focusing on changes in QoL in connection with progressing dementia and contributing factors. This may be due to the fact that the QoL amongst EwD was examined in relation to a relatively limited group of factors, even though previous research recommended to examine the changes in QoL amongst EwD in the long run and in a larger group of respondents.||Project Objectives In order to maintain the maximum possible quality of life in people suffering from a disease of the nervous system, an early diagnosis and therapy is necessary, as well as nursing and psychosocial care.||The aim is not only to improve the quality of life with a lower frequency and length of hospitalisations, but also to enhance individual's resilience.||The chance to express the quality of life subjectively shifts the assessment of health care results from a solely medical perspective to an assessment from the perspective of a concrete individual.||The objective of the project is a monitoring of the trajectory of subjectively perceived quality of life amongst the elderly with early-phase dementia in the long run. Identifying the factors and their effect on the quality of life may help to enhance resilience of the elderly and to have a positive effect on the physical, psychosocial and social dimension of the quality of life with early-phase dementia in home care and thus lower the frequency and length of hospitalisations as well as costs in health care and social care.||The main aim of the project is to ascertain how quality of life changes amongst Czech elderly with early-phase dementia (quality of life trajectory). To achieve the main aim, five sub-aims have been set, which should support the investigation of quality of life in patients with a nervous system disease, namely amongst the elderly at an early phase of dementia.||Translation and validation of Czech versions of standardised QOL-AD and PDI questionnaires.|Identification of the most important factors contributing to the changes in quality of life among Czech elderly with early-phase dementia.|Creation of a profile of quality of life trajectory amongst Czech elderly at an early phase of dementia.|Comparison of the trajectory of Czech elderly with early-phase dementia to the trajectory of the elderly not diagnosed with dementia.|Creation of a database for subsequent longitudinal trajectory tracking the quality of life of older people with dementia Methodology In order to achieve the goals of the project, a prospective, longitudinal design using quantitative method will be used - a survey research will be carried out in a group of respondents on entering the study and repeated twice subsequently at 12-month interval.||Prior to the 1st stage of the survey research, a translation and validation of QOL-AD and PDI questionnaires will be done. Based on the results of international studies, a group of factors was identified which affect quality of life in the elderly with dementia.||The research will be carried out using a batch of standardised Czech versions of questionnaires related to these factors: Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD); Geriatric Depression Scale by Yesavage (GDS-15) - Czech version; Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE - Czech version). In case the use of MMSE is bound with licence fees a Czech version of the Addenbrook Cognitive Examination (ACE-CZ) will be used; Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI); Attitude to Aging Questionnaire (AAQ) - Czech version; Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) - Czech version; Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) - Frail Index; Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS-CZ), Horizontal visual analog scale (HVAS). Furthermore, the comorbidity index and basic demographic data (age, sex, socio-economic status, education) will be gathered and evaluated.||Research sample will consist of two groups of older adults. The first (patient) group: elderly with a diagnosed dementia at an early phase (F00, F01-F03) will be addressed together with their family caregivers via neurologic outpatient offices, where the elderly are treated for the diagnoses.||The second (control) group: elderly without dementia, addressed through GP's surgeries.||The respondents will be gathered in the Olomouc, Moravia-Silesia and Hradec Králové Regions.

NCT03817138,"The UK government has prioritised early recognition and treatment of dementia, with specific goals to prolong independence, delay nursing home and hospital admissions, and reduce mortality. It is recognised that this strategy in the UK health system necessitates primary care involvement in diagnosis and management of dementia. While advances have been made in identifying patients with dementia within primary care, there is little research on the course of the disease after diagnosis, even though information about disease course and the factors that alter the course are essential to patient management and wider health policy.||One potential major resource for studying these issues in primary care are Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases which contain routinely recorded information from consultations with a GP and other healthcare professional such as illnesses and treatment provided. They are a useful resource for studying how illnesses progress after diagnosis in primary care and have been used to investigate disease course, outcomes and patient care in a wide spectrum of diseases. However, to date, they have not been used to research the course of dementia after diagnosis. Existing evidence has established important dementia outcomes (e.g. nursing home placement, hospital admissions, mortality) are recorded within EHR and a systematic review that has recently been performed suggests other illnesses and symptoms (e.g. cognitive status, neuropsychiatric symptoms), may be recorded within primary care EHR and could serve as markers of disease progression.||To address this research gap the research will identify possible markers of disease progression from routinely collected in primary care medical records and compare them against assessments of disease progression from specialist dementia service medical records. The study will enable healthcare professionals to use routinely recorded information in primary care, without the need for intensive assessments, to identify individuals with dementia who are at risk of a faster disease progression. This will drive the future development and delivery of treatment to the individual patient with dementia based on their likely future course.||The CoMed study is a retrospective cohort design linking dementia service and primary care medical records. Potential participants' only involvement will be a request for consent to access and link these medical records.||Participants will be recruited from a secondary care dementia service.||All patients who have a confirmed diagnosis of dementia in the dementia service medical records and who have been assessed by the dementia service at more than one-time point at least 12 months apart will be identified (a 12-month gap is the minimum necessary to determine disease progression). The first 1000 eligible patients will be initially identified (expected number required to obtain sample size required of 400 patients), however, further searches can be carried out if the expected response and recruitment rate is not met. The list of patients to be invited will be screened by the patient's clinical care team in the participating dementia service to exclude those who it would be inappropriate to contact as it may cause undue distress or harm.||Eligible patients who have been seen by the dementia service within the previous 12 months will be identified by the dementia service clinical care team. These eligible patients will be sent by post the study information pack containing: an invitation letter, patient and personal consultee information leaflets, patient consent and personal consultee declaration forms, and a stamped addressed return envelope. If there is no reply to the initial invitation, then a reminder invitation and study information pack will be sent after a minimum of 2 weeks. A poster about the study will be displayed in the dementia service clinical areas and waiting areas, and a copy of the poster in leaflet form will be available for patients to take away and read if they wish.||A review of the response and recruitment rate will be undertaken at regular intervals to assess whether more patients need to be identified (based on a 40% recruitment rate). If the required number of patients is not achieved additional recruitment strategy will be initiated. An additional search of the dementia service medical records to identify further eligible patients and study packs will be posted out.||For those who are willing to take part in the study written informed consent will be obtained from patients with dementia (or personal consultee's advice for those not able to give consent) to access their dementia service medical records and their primary care medical records and for these to be linked and used for research purposes.||In those consenting to take part in the study, patient data will be retrieved from the dementia service records including detailed clinical assessments of cognitive status, behavioural and function assessments, and the time points of these assessments. The patient's primary care medical records will be requested from their GP practice. Details on how to electronically download the requested medical records and securely transfer them via the secure NHS email system will be included with the letter to GP practices.||Confidentiality and anonymity will be maintained for all participants. All information collected regarding participants will be kept confidential. Participants will be free to withdraw from the study and to request their medical records are not used up to a period of one month from the date consent is given. After this point, pseudoanonymised data will be used and it will not be possible to identify patients to remove their medical records from the analysis dataset. The presence or absence of potential markers of progression recorded in patients' primary care records will then be compared to change in scores from standard clinic assessments recorded at the specialist dementia clinic.",Dementia
NCT02483520,"This clinical trial will test the FamTechCare intervention that uses multidisciplinary professional guidance based on in-home video monitoring to support family caregivers in managing behaviors of persons with dementia (PWD). Families provide the majority of care for PWD at home. However the stress of caregiving is so significant that it increases caregiver morbidity and mortality. Stress is magnified by disruptive behaviors that frequently lead to nursing home placement. In-home video monitoring allows experts to assess behaviors of PWD and to identify antecedents, recommend specific interventions, and subsequently evaluate caregiver outcomes. FamTechCare uses new technology to link family caregivers to experts for guidance in managing disruptive behaviors, supporting continued care at home while reducing the negative effects of caregiving.||Caregiver-PWD dyads (N=88) will be randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Both groups will record behaviors during daily care for 3 months using a home monitoring unit. Notably, this new technology captures 3-5 minutes prior to the behavior, thus recording behavior triggers and precursors. Intervention group videos will be auto-uploaded to a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) secure Internet site for weekly team review with in-home feedback to caregivers in behavior management. The time and attention equivalent control group will receive a weekly phone call from a nurse, but their recorded videos will be held for review and feedback after 3 months.||Study aims are to identify interventions, based on in-home observations, to assist caregivers in behavior management. Between-group effects on outcomes, including PWD disruptive behaviors and caregiver burden and other negative outcomes will be compared using linear mixed modeling. Ease of use and satisfaction, cost-efficiency, and factors influencing likelihood of translation into practice will be evaluated. This tests new technology for direct observation and immediate feedback to empower families to manage PWD behaviors at home while reducing caregiver stress and morbidity. Technology links caregivers to individualized expert guidance, acknowledging the importance and burden of their role. This study addresses NIH missions and the 2012 National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease goals, integrating strategies to promote adoption and use of aging services technologies in interventions that will reduce negative caregiver outcomes, a growing public health problem.",Dementia

NCT01334749,"Risk of dementia is high after stroke but the mechanisms of post stroke dementia (PSD) are insufficiently understood. Specifically, there are few data on how vascular and neurodegenerative mechanisms interact in determining cognitive decline after stroke. The primary aim of the DEDEMAS/DEMDAS (Determinants of Dementia After Stroke) study is to identify predictors of PSD. A particular focus will be on biological markers (neuroimaging, biochemical markers derived from blood) and on interactions between vascular and neurodegenerative mechanisms. Patients with an acute stroke and without prior dementia will be followed for 5 years with assessments at baseline (< 72 h after onset of stroke), and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. In addition, DEDEMAS patients will have an annual telephone follow-up from year 6 to 10. Baseline assessments will include variables previously demonstrated to be associated with PSD as well as novel variables. Brain MRI (structural MRI and resting state fMRI) in combination with detailed neuropsychological testing and blood draws will be done at 6, 12, 36, and 60 months. Patients developing cognitive impairment (with or without dementia) and a subgroup of matched individuals without cognitive decline will be examined by brain FDG-PET and Amyloid-PET scanning. Lumbar puncture will be done on patients who develop cognitive impairment and thus have a clinical indication for the procedure. Efforts will be made to classify demented patients into diagnostic categories (Vascular Dementia, Mixed Dementia, Alzheimer's disease, other categories).

NCT03757806,"Sustaining levels of regular physical activity of people with dementia is essential to maintain independence on activities of daily living, increase health-related quality of life and delay the need for institutionalization. Home-based physical activity programs, involving the caregivers, may overcome the drawbacks of the low adherence and high dropout rates by including physical activity in daily routines of people with dementia, thus increasing their motivation and confidence levels. LiFE is a home-based physical activity program which embeds training into patients' daily routines. It has shown to be well accepted and effective in healthy older people, however its effectiveness in people with dementia remains unknown.||Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to assess the impact of a home-based physical activity program, based on the LiFE program and involving the caregivers (LiFE4D), on exercise tolerance of community-dwelling people with dementia, using a randomized controlled design. The secondary aims are to:||establish the feasibility of LiFE4D and adherence to the intervention;|explore the impact of the LiFE4D on other health-related physical fitness components, (i.e., neuromotor, muscular strength, flexibility and body composition); physical activity, health-related quality of life, social networks and informal care time provision;|assess the cost-effectiveness of the LiFE4D on the number of falls, healthcare resources utilization, length of hospital stay and number of respiratory infections.||To accomplish these aims, a pilot (task 1) and a randomized controlled study (task 2) will be conducted. LiFE4D will be centered on the duo participant/caregiver capacities and potentialities and it will be a significant contribution towards the development and implementation of an innovative home-based physical activity intervention. Additionally, it will inform the cost-effectiveness of this intervention in people with dementia. Ultimately, findings from this project will provide guidance to national and international health policies on physical activity promotion in community-dwelling people with dementia.||Task 1: LiFE4D - Pilot study||A pilot study will inform sample size, recruitment/randomization procedures and feasibility of LiFE4D.||Ethical approval will be obtained from Ethics and Data Protection Committees. People with dementia will be included if they: have a diagnosis of mild/moderate dementia according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V); are living at home; are not participating in exercise training; are able to follow instructions and have a caregiver. People with dementia will be excluded if they: have been hospitalized in the previous month; present any clinical condition that precludes them to be involved in physical activity; have been taking medication that affect exercise capacity/bone density. Eligible participants will be identified via care homes, day care centers and Alzheimer Cafes (meetings with people with dementia and families). These institutions will contact eligible participants. Informed consent will be obtained from interested people with dementia and legal representatives.||The Experimental Group (EG) will receive the LiFE4D in addition to usual care (e.g., pharmacologic treatment), whilst the Control Group (CG) will receive usual care only.||Protocol will take approximately 1h and data will be collected at participants' home at baseline and after 12 weeks. ActiGraph will be used during one week before and one week after the 12 weeks. Participants will wear the ActiGraph for at least 6 consecutive days.

Adherence to LiFE4D and number/reasons of dropouts will be collected.||Intervention LiFE4D information will be offered during a collective session for the EG, i.e., people with dementia and their caregivers. Then, the individualized program will be set up, adapted to the participant's needs/preferences.||People with dementia will train balance, flexibility, endurance and strength multiple times/day in their everyday tasks with the support/supervision of their caregivers. Strategies to improve balance include ""reduce base of support"" (e.g., working at the kitchen while standing on one leg), ""move to limits of sway"", ""shift weight from foot to foot"", ""step over objects"" and ""turning and changing direction"". Strategies to increase strength and endurance include ""bend your knees"" (e.g., squatting instead of bending at the waist to close a drawer or to picking things up from the floor), ""on your toes"", ""up the stairs"", ""on your heels"", ""sit to stand"", ""walk sideways"" and ""tighten muscles"". Intensity of training will be adjusted throughout the program based on the regular evaluation of balance and strength.||The program will last for 12 weeks, with a lower face tracking over time with the health professional but replaced by involvement of caregivers. Specifically includes:||Weeks 1-4: 3 face-to-face sessions/week;|Weeks 5-8: 2 face-to-face sessions/week and a biweekly phone call;|Weeks 9-11: 1 face-to-face session/week and a phone call;|Week 12: 1 phone call. Face-to-face sessions aim to adapt physical activity to everyday tasks, increase tasks frequency and/or intensity, monitor progress, clarify doubts, motivate higher daily energy expenditure and manage expectations. Telephone contacts aim to monitor people with dementia's motivation/evolution and clarify doubts of people with dementia and caregivers.||Task 2: Implementation and evaluation of LiFE4D||Informed by task 1, a powered (80%, alpha=0.05) randomized controlled trial will be designed.||Data collection times: as described in task 1, however, additional assessments for follow up will be conducted at 3, 6 months after the LiFE4D, to assess short- and long-term results.",Dementia

NCT03773757,"Dementia is an increasingly prevalent, costly and burdensome condition. The dramatic aging of the US population is creating a dementia ""epidemic"" that our health care system is poorly prepared to handle. More than 5 million people are affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias in 2016, with that number estimated to nearly triple to 13.8 million by 2050. The direct health care costs alone for dementia care are projected to increase from $236 billion in 2016 to more than $1 trillion in 2050. In addition to cognitive and functional deterioration, patients with dementia experience behavioral and psychological complications such as agitation and depression. Family caregivers of patients with dementia experience higher levels of anxiety, depression, chronic fatigue, and an increased mortality risk.||Dementia and palliative care are national research priorities. Both dementia and palliative care have been identified as priority conditions for research and quality improvement by numerous organizations such as the Institute of Medicine, National Quality Forum, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and NIA. In addition, a workgroup developing milestones for care and support under the U.S. National Alzheimer's Plan has explicitly stated that palliative care needs to be incorporated throughout the course of caring for patients and families affected by dementia.||2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims||Aim 1: To test the effect of the IN-PEACE intervention on patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., agitation/aggression, anxiety, repetitive behaviors). Mixed effects models will be used to compare repeated NPI-Q scores obtained at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months. Repeatedly measured NPI-Q scores will be the dependent variable in the model.||Aim 2: To test the effect of the IN-PEACE intervention on patients' overall symptom outcomes. Analyses in this aim will use repeatedly measured SM-EOLD scores over 24 months of follow-up as the dependent variable in the mixed effects model, similarly to the approach described for Aim 1.||Aim 3: To test the effect of the IN-PEACE intervention on caregivers' distress and mood. Aim 3 analyses will use repeatedly measured caregiver NPI-Q distress scores and caregiver PHQ-9 over 24 months of follow-up as the dependent variables in separate mixed effects models, similar to the approach for Aim 1.||Aim 4: Evaluate the effect of the IN-PEACE intervention on ER/hospital use. ER/hospitalization events will be obtained from accessing electronic medical records maintained by the Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE) and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC). Poisson regression models will be used to compare rates of any ER/hospitalization event between the two groups while adjusting for dementia severity and significant baseline variables that differ between the two groups.",Dementia
NCT02055092,"Background: Most common dementia cases in Young Onset dementia (YOD) are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). There is little knowledge about the impact on the affected families, especially with regard to FTD. Although their life situation and specific needs differ from that of older people, they are referred to the same healthcare services.||Hypothesis:||QoL is poorer among persons with FTD and their families compared to AD at baseline.|There is less worsening of QoL after two years in persons with AD and their families compared to FTD.|People with YOD have different needs for health care services than older people with dementia.|YOD and their families have more unmet needs than older people with dementia.||Methods: Nordic multicenter observational cohort study of YOD-AD and YOD-FTD. 75 persons in each group, living at home with their families, recruited from five Norwegian and four Nordic memory clinics. The control group consists of 100 older people with dementia age ≥70 years. The investigators use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.||The follow-up period of the persons with YOD and their family members is two years. Assessments are made at baseline, 12 and 24 months, with telephone check-ups at 6 and 18 months. The main assessment questionnaires are Quality of life in Alzheimer's disease (QoL-AD), Camberwell Assessment of Need in the Elderly (CANE), and Resource Utilization in Dementia Lite (RUD Lite).||Study aims for the quantitative part of the study:||To evaluate the quality of life of persons with YOD and their family members.|To identify and explore the specific needs of YOD and their families.|To assess the use of health resources and calculate the costs associated with care for YOD, in comparison with older persons with dementia.|To compare the functional characteristics of YOD with older people with dementia in terms of cognitive decline, impairment of activities of daily living, changes in behavior, and quality of life.||Study aims and methods for the qualitative part of the study:||To investigate how people living alone with young-onset dementia cope with everyday life and decision-making. A longitudinal study with qualitative interviews at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after initial diagnosis|To investigate how it is to be a spouse/cohabitation to a person with young-onset of frontotemporal dementia.

NCT03575026,"Dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder and it can adversely affect patient's cognitive, behavioural, social and emotional functioning. Its prevalence will increase continuously because of the increase in aging population and it is predicted that around 333,000 people in Hong Kong (equivalent to 11% population aged 60 or above) will suffer from dementia in year 2039. The gradual functional decline, communication difficulties, the behavioural symptoms associated with cognitive impairment, may affect the relationships with the family members and the wellbeing. A latest Cochrane Review commented that music-based intervention may be helpful to improve emotional wellbeing and quality of life according to some limited evidences, as well as depressive symptoms, although future studies with larger sample sizes and more rigorous research design are suggested||In 2014 - 2016, our team has modified a music-with-movement intervention designed for nursing home residents with moderate dementia, into a protocol specified for caregiver-delivered home-based intervention to promote the psychosocial wellbeing of people with early dementia in Hong Kong. We found that the dyadic music-with-movement intervention yielded significant reduction on anxiety levels of people with early dementia as compared to control group. Similar, Särkämö and colleagues also found that caregiver-implemented music intervention group have reduced depression of people with early dementia and reduced caregiver burden. With the strong evidence that music intervention is useful in improving the wellbeing of people with early dementia and their family caregiver, it is essential to disseminate the culture-appropriated and validated intervention for promoting health and evaluate its effectiveness in real-practice setting by implementation research.||This research is anchored by a conceptual framework of leisure and subjective wellbeing. This framework explained that through participating in activities outside the obligated works (either paid or unpaid) that is subjectively regarded as leisure, would lead to an improvement of well-being through five psychological mechanisms, namely detachment-relaxation, autonomy, mastery, meaning and affiliation. Caregivers and care-recipients are found relaxed after participating in music intervention because they are temporary detached from the everyday caregiving chaos. Participating in an intervention designed by the participants themselves would increase their sense of autonomy and mastery. During the dyadic music intervention, the caregivers and people with MCI/early dementia would design their activities within the music-with-movement framework after instruction of music therapist that allow them to exercise their choices based on their music preference. Through the interaction in the dyadic intervention, it has been found that through participating in dyadic music intervention, people with dementia and their caregivers have improved in relationship and social inclusiveness. Caregivers would feel their competence or mastery in the skills when leading music intervention. Staff and caregivers reported that activities that address the psychological needs, provide enjoyment, value individuality, reinforce a sense of identity and belonging are meaningful to people with dementia. Therefore, we hypothesized that dyadic music-with-movement intervention would improve the subjective wellbeing of both the people with MCI/early dementia and their caregiver, if there are relevant implementation strategies to increase the ease of uptake of the intervention. For example, stress of caregivers could be relieved by successful music intervention.||When the aim is to maximize the uptake of the intervention in the real-life settings as a routine, we have to examine the influence of contextual factors on implementation. Hence, this study have three main objectives:||To test the effectiveness of the dyadic music-with-movement intervention on wellbeing of people with MCI/early dementia, and of their caregivers in real-life settings;|To conduct a process evaluation of the effectiveness-implementation study by gathering information on the implementation process; and||To validate and extend the applicability of ""Leisure & Wellbeing"" conceptual framework to the dyads.||In this project, one of the implementation strategies to maximize the uptake of the music intervention by the dyads, is to train a team volunteers to support the caregivers and people with MCI/early dementia, which is a unique group of population. There is a general lack of knowledge and inappropriate attitude towards dementia or Alzheimer's disease worldwide. In Hong Kong, it was reported that university students majoring in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy and social work showed inadequate knowledge towards this group of patients. By providing training for volunteers to support participating dyads, it would be able to provide a better understanding on dementia and create a supportive community for dementia. Therefore, we will explore the changes in the following outcomes of the volunteers:||To examine the change of knowledge and attitudes towards dementia of the volunteers before and after participating in the project; and|To examine the change of satisfaction and motivation to volunteering before and after participating in the project.",Dementia
NCT03413384,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that can cause significant disability and decrease quality of life. It is a chronic and progressive disease which means the symptoms become worse over time.||Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is a decline in thinking and reasoning that develops in many people living with PD at least a year after diagnosis. An estimated 50 to 80 percent of patients with PD eventually experience dementia as the disease progresses. Key risk factors or correlation consistently associated with PDD are older age, more severe parkinsonism (particularly rigidity, postural instability and gait disturbance), male gender, certain psychiatric symptoms (depression, psychosis) and mild cognitive impairment. PDD has a unique clinical profile and neuropathology, commonly reported symptoms include changes in memory, concentration and judgment; trouble interpreting visual information; muffled speech; visual hallucinations; delusions, especially paranoid ideas; depression, irritability and anxiety; and sleep disturbances, including excessive daytime drowsiness and rapid eye movement sleep disorder.||The investigational product (IP) is 1 g of ceftriaxone powder manufactured by Sandoz Company reconstituted with 1% lidocaine as diluent before use. Ceftriaxone is a sterile, semisynthetic, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic for intramuscular or intravenous administration. Ceftriaxone is the drug substance of Rocephin first approved by FDA in 1984 as a cephalosporin antibiotic, and is clinically widely used and currently off patent.||The current main treatment goal of PDD focuses on the improvement of disease symptoms. However, the irreversible deterioration of cognitive and motor functions is the most challenge issue for therapeutic agent development. Ceftriaxone was found to have functions in reducing glutamatergic hyperactivity and excitotoxicity and may exhibit neuro-protective functions as the mechanism in PDD treatment. The therapeutic effects of ceftriaxone on the animal model of PDD showed ceftriaxone works on 1) preventing cognitive and motor deficits, 2) inhibiting dopaminergic degeneration and restoring neuronal density and activity in the striatum and SNc, 3) inhibiting cell loss and restoring neuronal density and activity in the hippocampus , 4) increasing neurogenesis in the substantia nigra and hippocampus dentate gyrus, 5) increasing glutamate transporter expression in the striatum and hippocampus , and 6) decreasing neuronal hyperactivity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The effects observed in the animal model of PDD have suggested ceftriaxone as a potential promising medical treatment for PDD patients to improve the cognitive and motor function defects. For such reasons, the investigators plan to conduct this phase II trial of ceftriaxone to determine the potential efficacy and obtain safety profiles in PDD patients.",Dementia

NCT03946696,"This study is a qualitative anthropological research that explores the effects of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) for people with moderate and severe dementia living in a care facility. In particular, the study explores the effects that AAT can have on people with moderate and later stages of dementia, living in a care facility, on: Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD); mood (depression); quality of life; activity (physical). The AAT effects on people with moderate and later stages of dementia will be compared with effects that other activities provided in the care facility where participants live, may have on the same participants.||AAT is defined as an activity provided by a handler and his/her animal (e.g., dog, cat, rabbit, bird, horse) for somebody living with a certain medical condition/illness. AAT is different than Assistant Dogs/Animal (e.g., guide dogs for the blind), who have a very specific training. In this research, we will focus mostly on therapy-dogs and therapy-owls for people with dementia living in care homes.||The research will be conducted over a period of 12 months. The primary methods that will be used are participant observation (accompanying and observing volunteers during animal-assisted therapy meetings and various activities in the care homes) and interviewing the residents, care homes' staff, volunteers, canine trainers and veterinarians. Additional data will be collected through document analysis (consulting care home policies and participants' care plans and medical notes) and auto-ethnography (auto-observations of interactions between the student and 2 dogs). While the focus of the research remains on the interactions between people with dementia and therapy-animals, the involvement of the other participants offers different perspectives of looking at these interactions and at their context. For anthropological research, it is fundamental that a certain topic/issue is addressed in its context by gathering information from multiple perspectives. This has been documented as being one of the biggest strengths of anthropological research investigating a clinical-related topic.||The aim of this research is to understand what are the effects that therapy-animals can have on people living with dementia (in moderate and severe stages) in a care facility. While it doesn't aim to compare people living with dementia in their own homes and their potential interaction with a therapy-animal, the research compares the effects of AAT with other activities (e.g., music therapy; craft therapy) and in the context of human interactions (e.g., interactions with other residents; care facility staff members; family members). Because it is documented that animals' therapeutic effects are possible through bond transference, the research also looks as part of the context at how the human-animal bond is formed, how can be transferred and how participants may develop a bond with the therapy-animal. This will be done by interviewing therapy-animal volunteers; canine trainers; and veterinarians. While these might appear as two different projects, we argue that this perspective (how the human-animal bond is formed and its potential therapeutic effect in being transferred) can offer new and original insights in understanding dementia and its stages, as well as a more accurate understanding of AAT effects on people with moderate and severe dementia.||Although the benefits of Animal-Assisted Therapy have been previously documented, these were mostly statistical or experimental studies. To date, there is no study that explores the relationship between therapy-animals and people with dementia using a long-term qualitative approach. Almost all the studies consulted in preparation for our protocol recommend a research that approaches AAT for people with dementia in the context of social interactions and living conditions and from the perspectives described by us. The lack of the context and of these perspectives have been documented/acknowledged as limitations of previous studies in understanding the effects of AAT for people with dementia. These limitations are addressed in our study by looking at them from the diversity of the perspectives we propose.||Given the increased number of people living with dementia, the moral imperative of offering them activities that enhance their quality of life especially in later stages, as well as the rising literature documenting the benefits of companion animals, we aim that this research to contribute to new approaches and policies of care for people with moderate and severe dementia.",Dementia

NCT04239924,"The intervention is an adaptation of the evidence-based REACH program (Resources Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health), designed for and validated in multiple settings to give education, tools, and support to informal caregivers of people with dementia, delivered through a series of at-home visits (minimum of 9 in-person and 3 phone sessions) conducted by trained and certified coaches over 6-12 months. The content of the coaching visits will follow the REACH program protocol, with materials customized with information about local community resources (e.g., Dane County).||Coach/administrator training for delivery of the REACH intervention will be conducted by master trainers from the Rosalynn Carter Institute (RCI) for Caregiving, a department of Georgia Southwestern State University, who administers, certifies, and provides oversight for REACH sites nationally (https://www.rosalynncarter.org/programs/rci-reach/). For the purposes of this pilot study, the investigators have coordinated with RCI to extend delivery of REACH content over a 12-month period, with home visits occurring more frequently at the beginning and spreading further apart towards the end, and additional phone ""REVIEW"" sessions between home-visits.||Each home visit covers specific coaching content, building on strategies and behaviors covered in prior sessions. The program includes flexibility to allow coaches to adapt the timing/delivery of content to attend to the needs of the caregiver (e.g., answering questions about previously-covered topics, covering topics from a future visit to help coach a caregiver through an emergent dementia-related issue). Sessions typically last 1-2 hours. Following each visit, the coach completes a fidelity checklist and writes client progress notes as per the REACH protocol.||This pilot adapts prior REACH implementations in two main ways: (1) intervention coaches will be community paramedics with advanced medical training, rather than social workers (or other non-medical social service personnel), and (2) the program will be formally coordinated with the participant and caregiver's primary care practice, allowing for care coordination and information sharing between participants, coaches, and clinic staff/providers. Participants will also have the ability to share information about their use of community dementia care resources (e.g., social services, transportation, senior center case management, dementia caregiver support groups, dementia-related educational programming, respite) with coaches so they can communicate necessary information to the clinic for possible inclusion in the participant's Electronic Health Record (EHR) (as per the clinic's determination), facilitate care coordination, and help keep the participant's care plan up to date. Paramedic coaches will be utilizing their medical knowledge, but not providing any direct medical care.||This pilot study also differs from prior REACH trials in that outcome measures include health care and emergency services utilization, particularly related to the occurrence of acute medical and behavioral problems, as well as perceptions of health care quality, in addition to caregiver psycho-socio-emotional measures (already included in the standard REACH assessment package).||The study will employ a stepped design using a rapid-cycle evaluation approach. Three cohorts of 4-5 patient-caregiver dyads each will start the intervention at staggered intervals. Within each cohort, a new dyad will begin the program approximately every two weeks, with an approximate four week gap between each cohort for feedback collection and program iteration. Real-time feedback obtained from multiple intervention stakeholders (caregivers, persons with dementia, coaches, clinical staff/providers - up to 10 enrolled) will be used to iteratively improve intervention delivery and program implementation for the next, all while the first group continues the pilot. In this way, problems can be identified and solutions generated, with enough time to adapt the program and evaluate revisions. Staggering participant start dates allows for multiple rapid-cycle iterations within a single pilot study.||NOTE: While COVID-19 restrictions are in place, all feedback interviews will take place by telephone or WebEx videoconferencing, beginning 17 March 2020.",Dementia

NCT03852121,"Background: China is one of the countries with the highest number of people with dementia (PWD), while over 90% of PWD are cared by informal caregivers in the community. Informal caregivers are found to have higher level of stress, and lower level of well-being than non-caregivers. However, positive outcomes of caregiving have also been noted. Caregiving appraisal is caregivers' cognitive evaluation of potential caregiving stressors and the efficacy of their coping efforts related to caregiving experience. Based on Lawton's Caregiving Appraisal and Psychological Well-being Model, caregiving appraisal is an important factor that leads to the positive or negative well-being outcomes of caregivers. Addressing the caregiving appraisal of informal caregiver may be able to help in promoting the caregiver well-being and delay premature institutionalization. Intervention for improving dementia caregiving appraisal is still scarce, especially in China. Bibliotherapy is the process of learning from high-quality written materials for therapeutic benefits, it has been proved to be effective in improving caregiving appraisal of informal caregivers of people with psychosis and depression, its effect on dementia caregivers is unsure.||Objectives: There are two research objectives in this study: (1) To determine the feasibility and acceptability of the evidence-based bibliotherapy protocol among informal caregivers of PWD in China. (2) To preliminarily explore the efficacy of bibliotherapy on improving caregiving appraisal.||Methods:||Sixty participants will be recruited from Zhengzhou, China, and will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group or usual care group. The feasibility of the intervention will be explored in terms of the ease of participant recruitment, attendance rate and the attrition rate. The acceptability will be explored by interviews of participants in the intervention group at post-intervention. The Chinese version of Caregiving Appraisal Scale, the Chinese version of Ways of Coping Questionnaire, the Chinese version of Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale, the Chinese version of Ryff's Psychological Well-being Scale, Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale and Dementia Attitude Scale will be used to measure caregiving appraisal, coping, positive aspects of caregiving, psychological well-being, knowledge of dementia and attitude toward dementia of informal caregivers of PWD respectively.

NCT03677284,"Introduction||How time is managed is of great importance for daily life, including participation and well-being (Christiansen, 2005). Time management behaviors relate positively to perceived control of time, satisfaction and health, and negatively to stress (Claessens, van Eerde, Rutte, & Roe, 2007). Prenda and Lachman (2001) demonstrated that planning predicted life satisfaction in older people, while Ouwehand et al. (2006) found that future time orientation was important for their well-being. The capacity for concrete planning has also been shown to predict well-being in older people over a one-year period (Tovel & Carmel, 2014). More broadly, the capacity to orient in time and plan is essential in goal-setting, the benefits of which have been extensively documented in older people (Frazier, Newman, & Jaccard, 2007).||Sweden, like most countries, is undergoing population ageing and an epidemiologic transition, which is leading to a greater number of people than ever before affected by dementia. Caused by a variety of brain illnesses, dementia affects thinking, memory, behavior and ability to perform everyday activities, including daily time management. Time perception and time orientation are essential functions that are compromised in dementia (El Haj, Gandolphe, Wawrziczny, & Antoine, 2016; Grewal, 1995; Iwamoto & Hoshiyama, 2012).Temporal relationships, and the coherence of past, present and future become unclear and vague; past time disappears and planning for the future seems less important or impossible. People with dementia may experience difficulties with regard to knowing, remembering and planning ""when"", and knowing ""how long"" different activities or situations would last. This causes problems to plan and keep appointments. Moreover, not being able to judge the length of time intervals can make them feel lonely when their spouse or informal caregiver is away due to a failure to gauge the length of the absence, which can cause stress and worry for both the person with dementia (PwD) and the caregiver (Nygard & Johansson, 2001)||Appropriate and effective assistive products can offer PwD and their relatives the opportunity to develop a more mutually satisfactory care relationship and enhance the person with dementia's capacity for self-management. Then, the time spent with the family caregiver is not reduced to a succession of required care tasks but can encompass more meaningful social and emotional engagements.||A review of technology for older people with cognitive or other impairments concluded that the cost-benefit was generally high or very high (Dahlberg, 2014). Despite this, the uptake of assistive products is quite low because of lack of competence, awareness, organization, user training and reliability of technical solutions. Family caregivers played a significant role in whether or not assistive products were absorbed into the everyday life practice (Arntzen, Holthe, & Jentoft, 2014). Moreover, it is important that assistive products are easy to maintain and fit into the context of use in order to increase the sense of control of the products by users with dementia, and thereby promote the goal achievement and usability of the products (Lindqvist, Larsson, & Borell, 2015). Research has also highlighted the necessity of adaptation of the products to individual users, regardless whether they are mainstream or specially-designed products (Boman, Nygård, & Rosenberg, 2014; Boman, Persson, & Bartfai, 2016).||To facilitate daily time management of people with cognitive impairments, time assistive products have been developed and evaluated (Gillespie, Best, & O'Neill, 2012). Enhanced time management in a PwD, with improved time keeping, planning capacity and goal-setting, could increase the potential for social interaction and participation, while reducing the negative impact and increasing the positive value of caregiving for relatives as identified in Balducci et al. (2008). It has been reported that assistive products can support people with dementia to orientate to dates, weekdays and time; to go back to sleep at night; to feel calmer, in control and more secure; and to cope and manage more effectively and to carry out daily routines. The products can increase the ability of people with dementia to retain roles, reduce the need for them to ask others about day and time, and reduce the number of times they wake up others at night. This helps caregivers to have better sleep and feel relieved, and to have a less stressful relation with the primary user of the product (Forsenäs et al. 2011; Hagen 2006)(Holthe, Hagen, Bjørneby, & Vollgate, 1998; Topo et al., 2007). Assistive products can provide users with an overview of the day, and remind them about activities (e.g., meals, medicine, visits and training). They can also give them time to do other things between scheduled activities, and inform about time and date (Bakken 2014). It has also been reported that assistive products can save time and effort, decrease worries and stress, and increase a sense of safety, which enabled users with dementia to perform their valued activities (Lindqvist, Nygård, & Borell, 2013). Still, although daily time management is such a significant difficulty in dementia, the evidence from populations with dementia is limited in both quantity and quality.||It is of vital importance to implement a research project that creates knowledge for developing effective time-related interventions for improving the well-being of people with dementia and informal caregivers.||Purposes||In order to contribute to the development and use of affordable and appropriate innovative assistive technology for daily time management among older people with dementia, the purposes of this project are:||to investigate and model the relationship between the use of time assistive products by older people with mild to moderate dementia, their daily time management and their well-being, and|to devise strategies for the acceptance and use of such products by older people with dementia and informal caregivers.||The purposes of this project are relevant in the field of ageing and health. The first purpose will explore how supportive technologies for functional abilities (in the form of time assistive products) affect older people's daily time management and well-being (including, activities, participation and independence). In addition to providing evidence of the effects of the products, the first purpose will result in an empirically based theoretical model to better understand their role. This model will offer a basis for the development of new and improved products and services.||The second purpose will contribute knowledge of experiences in PwD directly and via their informal caregiver, about their use of time assistive products and their perceptions of learning how to use them. This includes identifying features that need to be integrated in the design of products and services in order to effectively address the needs of older PwD and their informal caregivers. This purpose will also contribute to the development of new and improved products and services by devising strategies that consider current barriers to and facilitators of the acceptance and use of such products.||The project will investigate time assistive devices for people with dementia from three perspectives - occupational therapists, PwDs and their informal caregivers. This is done in three phases with the following research questions:||Research questions||Phase I - The perspective of occupational therapists:||1. What are the occupational therapist's experiences of prescribing time assistive products for persons with mild or moderate dementia, focusing on facilitating and hindering factors?||Phase II - Intervention with focus on persons with mild or moderate dementia and their informal caregivers:||2a) To what degree can time assistive products support persons with mild or moderate dementia in reaching their personal activity goals, in performance of daily activities and in satisfaction with the performance? 2b) What is the relation between time-processing ability, daily time management, and well-being of people with mild or moderate dementia within differing socioeconomic and care contexts? 2c) How can intervention with time assistive products affect time-processing ability, daily time management and well-being of people with dementia and the well-being of their informal caregivers? 2d) Are there differences in results of research questions 2a - 2c between different cultures (Sweden, India and Japan)?||Phase III - Deepening of the perspective of the informal caregivers:||3a) What experiences do informal caregivers have of people with dementia's use of time assistive products in daily situations? 3b) How does this use affect the situation of informal caregivers?||Procedure and data Collection||As the primary outcome measures Kit for Time-processing ability (KaTid), Self-rating of daily time management (Time-S) and Time-Proxy scale for rating daily time management (Time-P) have not been used for the target group, the instruments and the procedure of the assessments have been evaluated by experienced occupational therapists working with persons with dementia. The instruments and the procedure of the assessments have been adapted for different cultural contexts in Sweden, India and Japan"".||The recruited PwDs will be randomly allocated to an intervention group or a control group.||All PwD, both randomized to intervention group and to waiting/control group, will have an information brochure about daily time management, frequent problems, and suggested strategies to manage them.||Main assessment points will be at baseline, three months post-baseline and six months post-baseline.||The intervention group will receive a time assistive product as support in daily time management.

NCT04495686,"More than 150,000 Virginians live with dementia. Most persons with dementia (PWD) are cared for by an unpaid family caregiver. These caregivers' provision of daily assistance to PWD is a critical part of the state's dementia care capabilities. Caregivers of PWD experience an array of negative biopsychosocial impacts related to their caregiving responsibilities that undermine their own well-being and their care capacity. They are often unprepared to manage the behavioral symptoms of dementia (BSD); unmanaged symptoms are associated with increased use of emergency care and institutional placement, which are burdensome outcomes for PWD, families, and public health systems.||An emergent body of research associates traumatic brain injury (TBI) with increased dementia risk. Veterans with a history of TBI are therefor at increased risk of developing dementia, putting their family members at risk for the established negative impacts of caregiving. Coordinated care programs have proven beneficial for both members of the dementia caregiving dyad, yet access barriers remain. Many caregivers have competing role responsibilities that conflict with consistent dementia care access, others are located in rural areas without access to specialized dementia care.||To surmount access barriers and countervail the negative impacts of caregiving, we propose an innovative, non-pharmacological intervention: a telehealth-delivered dementia care coordination program that provides family and caregiver support and will improve the quality of life (QoL) for both caregivers and PWD. A goal of our project is to fill an existing service gap by providing coordinated dementia care to an underserved population: caregivers of persons with TBI dementia.||Our study will test three primary hypotheses: 1) Caregivers of persons with dementia who participate in the telehealth care coordination program will experience greater improvements in study caregiver outcomes (depression, burden, reactions to BSD and QoL) than caregivers of PWD receiving best medical treatment (BMT); 2) Caregivers who participate in the program will experience greater satisfaction with care than caregivers in the BMT group; 3) The program will comparable benefits for caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (PWD-ADRD) and persons with TBI dementia (PWD-TBI).||In addition, our study includes three exploratory hypotheses: 1) Certain caregiver characteristics (external locus of control; lower self-efficacy, sense of hope, and self-perceived caregiver aptitude) will be negatively associated with improvements in caregiver study outcomes; 2) Caregivers in the intervention group will experience greater reductions in emergency/unnecessary health care utilization then caregivers in the BMT group; 3) The intervention will impart sustained caregiver benefits in primary study outcomes.||Project specific aims include: 1) Evaluate the benefits of a telehealth-delivered care coordination program intervention for caregivers of PWD relative to best medical treatment; 2) Evaluate the impact of the intervention on caregiver satisfaction; 3) Determine the comparative effectiveness of the care coordination program between caregivers of persons with ADRD those with TBI dementia; 4) Explore caregiver characteristics that influence intervention outcomes (burden, depression, QoL, responses to BSD); and 5) Investigate whether the intervention reduces emergency and unplanned health care utilization.||Our research strategy is a prospective, randomized, unblinded study investigating the benefits of a 12-month telehealth-delivered dementia care coordination intervention, with follow up assessments to examine the longevity of the intervention impacts. We will enroll 3 study groups: 50 caregivers of PWD-ADRD receiving the telehealth coordinated care intervention; 50 caregivers of PWD-ADRD receiving best medical treatment, and 25 caregivers of PWD-TBI receiving the intervention. We will collect baseline,12-, and 18-month data to examine intervention effectiveness on caregiver study outcomes and test the prolonged intervention effects.||Our study uses an innovative telehealth approach to provide care for families living with dementia. Family support has important implications at the individual, family, community, and national level. Strategies to reduce caregiver burden and improve QoL for civilian and military families can lead to greater satisfaction with care and prolong caregivers' capacity to keep their loved ones at home, reducing burdens on public payment systems, including the VA.

NCT01774448,"The overall objective of the proposed study is to investigate the efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) to alleviate depression symptoms, increase attention abilities, and improve quality of life in individuals with dementia and their caregivers. MBCT works to help individuals increase concentration and increase awareness of depressive thinking to ultimately provide a better means of coping and emotional regulation.||While dementia is non-reversible and progressive in nature, supportive interventions, especially at the early stage of the disease, can make life more manageable for both dementia individuals and their caregivers. Along with the initial signs of forgetfulness and concentration difficulties, it is common for both individuals with dementia and their primary caregivers to also experience depression symptoms. For dementia individuals, depression symptoms are common early on as they still have insight into their disease. This increase in depression has been shown to be related to apathy, overall poorer quality of life and cognitive decline. Caregivers not only witness a significant change in daily functioning of someone they love and know well, they are also faced with new responsibilities associated with managing the disease, while simultaneously trying to juggling their own day-to-day tasks. These drastic changes and increased responsibilities have been shown to increase feelings of depression and burden, resulting in coping-related problems in caregivers.||Counseling intervention in early stages of dementia has been shown to delay and even decrease patient admittance into long-term facilities, ultimately relieving stress placed on the healthcare system. MBCT is a specific program designed to, and proven successful at, treating various populations with recurrent depression. With its unique therapeutic approach of integrating intensive training in mindfulness meditation with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, MBCT helps individuals pay greater attention, increase concentration, increase awareness of depressive thinking and learn to apply more skillful means of coping. In addition to treating depression, the meditation component of MBCT has also been shown to improve various aspects of attention and result in changes in neural networks implicated in attention processes. The investigators predict that MBCT will alleviate depression symptoms and increase quality of life in both patients and caregivers. The investigators also expect that individuals will experience improvements in attention and memory abilities.||If successful, MBCT could improve overall quality of life in dementia individuals and caregivers, as well as benefit our healthcare system by delaying institutionalization. From a research perspective, success of this program may lead to a larger clinical controlled trial to further investigate the efficacy of MBCT in individuals affected by dementia.",Dementia
NCT01774799,"The over-riding goal of the EVINCE study is to conduct a cluster RCT of a video Advance Care Planning intervention in nursing home residents with advanced dementia. A total of 360 nursing home residents with advanced dementia (N=180/arm) in 20 matched nursing homes (10 intervention/10 control) will be recruited. These residents' proxies with also be recruited for a total sample size of 720 residents and proxies (resident/proxy dyads). Outcomes will be compared between residents in the intervention vs, control nursing homes at baseline and every 3 months up to 12 months. At baseline proxies of residents in the intervention nursing homes will view a 12-minutes video describing three level of care options in advanced dementia (intensive, basic and comfort) and their choice will be communicated to the resident's primary care providers. Residents in the control nursing homes will receive the usual advance care planning practiced in those facilities.||UPDATE SEPT 19, 2014: During the first 18 months of the study, recruitment of resident/proxy dyads was lower per facility than anticipated at the time of study design. Therefore, the number of matched pairs of NH recruited was increased. As of September 19, 2014, 19 NH pairs (38 NHs) were recruited and randomized with a plans to continue to up to 30 pairs as needed.||NHs were originally randomized using a paired approach matched for for-profit status and whether or not the NH had a special care dementia unit (SCU). In March 2014, the state of Massachusetts changed legislation defining an SCU. Many of the changes focused on specifics of staff training. As a result, SCUs in several participating facilities did not meet the new criteria and lost this official designation, although the actual clinical structure of the existing units did not change. Nonetheless, we opted to maintain the initial matching criteria of the first 19 NHs which included SCU based on the definition before the Massachusetts legislation change, but dropped this matching criterion after the legislation change. Thus, beginning with matched pair 20, NHs were matched solely on for-profit status.||UPDATE MARCH 2016 To reach subject recruitment numbers, additional facilities were recruited. As of this date, 60 NHs (30/arm) have been recruited, randomized and have had subject enrolled.||To achieve additional for power for Outcome 2, (aquisition of new decisions to forego hospitalizations) the target sample size was increased to 400.",Dementia

NCT01303367,"Cumulative observations indicate that demented patients withdrawn antipsychotics may not exacerbate BPSD. The DART-AD study shows that both demented patients with/without antipsychotics for six months have no significant difference in cognitive symptoms and BPSD (Ballard et al., 2008). Moreover, the results of a long-term follow-up DART-AD study demonstrate that the survival rate of demented patients with antipsychotics is lower than those without antipsychotics at 24th month (with group vs. without group = 40% vs. 71%) and 36th month (with group vs. without group = 30% vs. 59%), respectively (Ballard et al., 2009). Recently, several studies indicate that antidepressants such as citalopram and milnacipran might be a new medication management for demented patients with BPSD (Pollock et al., 2007).||The present study is designed as a retrospective open-label pilot study. The initial research goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of psychotropic agents in demented patients in Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) (2005 v.s. 2008) and prescription rates of psychotropic agents in demented patients in Taipei Medical University-Teaching Hospitals (from 2002 to 2010). The psychotropic agents are defined as antipsychotic, antidepressant, sedative-hypnotic, anticonvulsant agents. Moreover, the second objective of this study is to investigate the risk of cardiovascular and aspiration pneumonia. Finally, the results of this study could be used to create the best and practical protocol of treatment for BPSD in demented patients of Taiwan to improve their drug safety and quality of life.||Currently, there is no treatment for BPSD, and pharmacists should recommend physicians to decrease the off-label use of antipsychotics in demented patients with BPSD. The main reason is due to the fact that off-label use of antipsychotics increases significantly the mortality rate of demented patients. The therapeutic management of BPSD should be based on the evidence-based medicine and patient safety.",Dementia

Dementia is associated with high health care costs, long term care (LTC) placement, medical complications, reduced quality of life, and CG burden. Patient and family centric care models tailored to dementia that address the multidimensional aspects of dementia management, and link health and community care are understudied but may represent a promising mechanism to address the multiple and on-going needs of this growing population, reduce adverse outcomes such as premature LTC placement, and produce cost benefits.||This is a definitive Phase III efficacy trial to test Maximizing Independence at Home-Streamlined (MIND-S), a home- based, care coordination intervention for community-living persons with dementia (PWD) and their family CGs that builds on pilot work. In a pilot trial, MIND at Home was successfully implemented in a diverse sample of 303 community-living individuals with memory disorders and was found to be acceptable to CGs, led to delays in time to transition from home, improved PWD quality of life, and CG time savings.||The current project is a 24-month, prospective, single- blind, parallel group, randomized controlled trial evaluating MIND-S in a cohort of 300 community-living PWD and their informal CGs in the Greater Baltimore area. Participants receiving MIND-S will get up to 18 months of care coordination by an interdisciplinary team comprised of trained memory care coordinators (non-clinical), a psychiatric nurse, and geriatric psychiatrist.

NCT03244917,"The final stage of dementia is characterized by recurrent suspected infections. Research has shown these episodes are widely mismanaged, leading to adverse patient and public health outcomes. Antimicrobials are extensively prescribed in advanced dementia, most often in the absence of clinical evidence to support a bacterial infection. Antimicrobial exposure is the main risk factor for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Nursing home (NH) residents with advanced dementia are three times more likely to be colonized with MDROs compared to other residents. Moreover, as these patients are in the terminal phase of dementia, evidence suggests they may not clinically benefit from antimicrobials. Comfort is the stated goal of care for 90% of advanced dementia patients, and the risks and burdens associated with work-up and treatment of suspected infections generally do not promote that goal, particularly when hospitalization is involved. Taken together, there is a clear need to improve infection management in advanced dementia both to provide better end-of-life care to these patients and reduce the public health threat of MDROs.||This is a 52-month study (8 months preparation; 36 months to conduct the trial; 8 months data analyses and manuscript preparation) of a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to improve infection management for suspected UTIs and LRIs among residents with advanced dementia (N=410; N=205/arm) living in NHs (N=28; N=14/arm).

NCT02733939,"While the enormous technological progress made in recent years has put technologies, such as mobile devices and smart phones, in the reach of many, innovators in dementia care are just starting to explore the full potential of these developments to transform them into valuable products and services for users. There is indeed a lack of studies that evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these new technologically-enriched interventions targeted at people with dementia. Previous large scale evaluations of the impact of telemedicine and telecare, such as the Whole Demonstrator System in the United Kingdom, did not include people with dementia despite Alzheimer's disease being one of the most burdensome diseases in Europe.||This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effects of new technologies on caregiver burden by reducing the time spent in supervision. The trial builds on previous promising results from the UP-TECH project in Italy (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01700556) . The technologies used in TECH@HOME will include similar, but improved, home monitoring kits potentially leading to a greater impact on caregivers' caring conditions. In addition, while the UP-TECH study did not allow the researchers to estimate the impact of the technology as a ""stand-alone"" intervention (the monitoring kits were only given in combination with case-management support), TECH@HOME will overcome this limitation thanks to the possibility to compare a group of technology users vs. non-users.

NCT03311711,"Progressive memory loss and impairment of reasoning and judgment are the main symptoms of dementia (including Alzheimer's Disease). For this reason, people in the early stages of dementia are encouraged to engage in advance care planning (ACP) while they are still competent to appoint a surrogate decision maker and meaningfully participate in ACP discussions with the surrogate.||The most common type of ACP is completing a medical power of attorney or living will, which does not require the patient and/or the family to understand the complexity of the medical decision-making process faced by the surrogate as the patient progresses to advanced disease. The failure to engage in ACP before the window of opportunity closes (i.e., before loss of decision making capacity) has serious adverse consequences with the greatest impact on the surrogate. As a matter of course in dementia, family members are left to make decisions regarding care transition, tube feeding, and other life-sustaining treatment without input from the patient and in the absence of a full understanding of the wishes, values and preferences of the patient.||To make an impact on the state of ACP for patients with dementia and their surrogates, the researchers will adapt and pilot test an efficacious ACP intervention, SPIRIT (Sharing Patient's Illness Representations to Increase Trust), with patients with mild dementia and their surrogates to promote open, honest discussions while such discussions about end-of-life care are possible. SPIRIT is a brief, scalable patient- and family-centered ACP intervention based on the Representational Approach to Patient Education with a goal to promote cognitive and emotional preparation for end-of-life decision making for patients with a serious or life-threatening illness and their surrogates. SPIRIT focuses on having both the patient and the surrogate fully understand end-of-life decision making in anticipation of a loss of decision-making capacity.||During Phase I of the study, a panel of seven experts will provide feedback on adapting SPIRIT to persons with dementia and their surrogates. SPIRIT will also be adapted to a video conference format so that patients and surrogates can receive the intervention in their home. To pretest the adapted SPIRIT intervention, the first 10 patient and surrogate dyads will be randomly assigned to SPIRIT-in person or to SPIRIT-remote. After completion of each session the interventionist will make field notes to document what did or did not go well, reasons for interruptions or difficulties, and contextual factors that cannot be captured in the audio-recording. During the post-intervention assessment each participant will complete the preparedness outcome questionnaires and will be asked about the overall experience with SPIRIT, any facets of the intervention that the participant found helpful or not helpful and the reasons (pacing, length, and modality), and suggestions for improvement. The researchers will alter or refine the intervention before pretesting a second set of 10 dyads.||Phase II of the study is a randomized clinical trial with three groups: SPIRIT-in person, SPIRIT-remote, and usual care. The researchers will recruit 120 dyads of patients with mild dementia and their surrogates. The groups will be stratified by race (white vs non-white). The primary outcomes are patient and surrogate self-reported preparedness for end-of-life decision making which will be measured at baseline and shortly after the intervention (by phone in the next 2-3 days). Additionally, the researchers will compare the completion rates of advance directives among the three groups and the impact of the three treatment conditions perceived by surrogates at 1-year post intervention.||As of July 2020, recruitment of Phase II participants into the SPIRIT-in person study arm ceased in consideration of social distancing guidelines due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.

To this aim, a life-course approach will be applied on a unique longitudinal population-based dataset spanning over 40 years, a very long period of time that is rarely achievable in observational studies. The results will also provide insights on the predictors and determinants of quality of life and psychosocial wellbeing in the oldest old.||CAIDE85+ is the third follow-up of the main CAIDE study. At baseline (midlife), data on e.g. socio-demographics, lifestyle, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, blood markers, and medical history were recorded. In addition, the first and second late-life re-examinations included cognitive assessments (three-step protocol for the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia), APOEƐ4 genotyping, and more detailed data on psychosocial factors, and medication use. In principle, the same measurements and methods will be used in CAIDE 85+, except for modifications/adaptations required by the specifics of the 85+ study population, or recent scientific developments related to the aims of the study. New developments compared with previous re-examinations include e.g. single-step assessment of cognitive status for all participants; more detailed assessment of physical functioning, multimorbidity and frailty; inclusion of questionnaires on oral health, sleep quality, malnutrition, and health-related quality of life.||Potential participants will be identified within the original CAIDE cohort, i.e. individuals who are still alive and living in the area where the study takes place (Kuopio and Joensuu, Finland).",Dementia
NCT04048980,"The high vulnerability of PwD hospitalized generates the need to confront this challenge from a global and continuous perspective along with the clear lack of intervention studies with PwD hospitalized at a national and international level.||The aim of this study is to design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention program for nurses looking after hospitalized patients with proximal femur fracture and dementia or cognitive impairment, in acute hospitals and its impact in quality of care, morbidity reduction, improvement of continuity of care and reduction in costs.||The study will be conducted in four traumatology units of high technology public hospitals across Spain: the autonomous communities included are Catalonia (Hospital Clinic Barcelona), Madrid (Hospital Puerta de Hierro Madrid), Cantabria (Hospital Marqués de Valdecilla) and Navarra (Complejo hospitalario de Navarra).

NCT04238520,"This study aims to develop and evaluate a functionally-tailored oral hygiene intervention to improve oral health for community-dwelling persons with dementia, while also reducing caregiver burden and improving the care partner relationship. The study consists of two phases. First, we will develop a modularized, functionally-tailorable oral care intervention based on caregiver qualitative interviews and existing literature. The second phase will then examine the efficacy and feasibility of the intervention through a randomized controlled trial with 40 Persons with Dementia/caregiver dyads. Control participants (n=20 dyads) will receive the standard oral hygiene education currently provided to persons with Dementia during dental care. The Intervention group (n= 20 dyads) will receive 4-week, dyadic, hands-on, functionally-tailored oral care intervention. We will collect data at baseline, 4-weeks, and 3 months post intervention. After data collection, the differences in the control and intervention groups in regard to their oral hygiene, behavioral symptoms during oral care, caregiver outcomes (burden, self-efficacy) and care partner relationship will be explored.||The specific aims of this study are:||Aim 1. Develop a staged and modifiable dyadic oral care intervention to provide functionally-tailored oral care rehabilitation for community-dwelling persons with dementia (PWD) and need-based skills training their family caregivers (CGs). Based on the literature review and MCWB, a 4-week intervention with 8 modules, including universal modules (e.g., environmental changes), CG modules (e.g., cuing strategies) and modules for both PWD and CGs (e.g., oral care techniques), will be developed addressing the relevant SCT constructs (e.g., functional deficits of PWD and caregiving needs of CGs). Guided by a validated, widely-used theory of rehabilitation medicine, modules will be used alone or in combination to provide personalized, hand-on, functionally-tailored oral care rehabilitation for PWD along with skills training for CGs to match their caregiving needs. The training focus shifts from the PWD to the CG, as the independence of the PWD decreases. Semi-structured interviews with family CGs will then be conducted (until data saturation is reached) to understand their oral care needs, desired intervention approaches, and the perceived feasibility and utility of the intervention. The intervention will be revised and then pilot tested with 4 dyads, one per each of the four functional levels of the DAT.||Aim 2. Evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention in home settings through a randomized, controlled trial with 40 pairs of PWD and their primary CGs, including immediate post-intervention and 3-month follow-up. Dyads will be stratified into 4 functional levels based on the PWD's DAT score and then randomly assigned to the intervention or control (non-tailored usual care) group.||Sub-Aim 2.1 Evaluate the feasibility of the intervention across four domains: acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality. We will interview the dyads and review their daily oral care logs at both post-intervention and 3-month follow-up, assessing satisfaction with, acceptability of, and actual use of the intervention. Oral care trainers will complete intervention logs following each training session to document the extent of content delivery, diversion from the protocol, resources used, and perceptions about intervention success. Exit interviews with PWD (when possible), CGs, and trainers will be conducted to identify potential barriers, facilitators, and needed changes.||Sub-Aim 2.2 Examine the efficacy of the intervention. We hypothesize that both PWD oral hygiene and CG self-efficacy in providing oral care will show clinically significant improvements for the intervention group compared to the control group. Secondary outcomes for PWD (e.g., behavior symptoms during oral care), CGs (e.g., oral care related burden) and the dyadic relationship (e.g., the Dyadic Relationship Scale) will also be explored.",Dementia
NCT04250376,"The present study is designed as an open label study of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia to evaluate longer term tolerability and early efficacy of transcranial ultrasound treatment.||Baseline and outcome measures in this study utilize validated tests that are appropriate for repeated measures which are not affected by practice effects. For patients with amnestic predominant cognitive change, the target will be the mesial temporal lobe through a trans temporal scalp window. Targeting will include reference to scalp fiducials based on the obtained MRI and Transcranial Doppler (TCD) waveform confirmation will be obtained because of the ability of TCD to record Doppler signal from the posterior cerebral artery that runs medial to the mesial temporal lobe.||On the day of the ultrasound appointment, patients will undergo ten to thirty minutes of transcranial ultrasound treatment. The sonification device will be aimed at the hippocampus or the putamen and substantia nigra, depending on the predetermined condition.

NCT04226872,"Background: Caregivers of Persons Living with Dementia (PLWD) in a Long Term Care (LTC) community are an at-risk group, and evidence suggests that the caregiver's mental health may actually worsen after the PLWD moves to LTC. Caregivers may report feelings of blame, self-doubt, loneliness, isolation, and powerlessness which negatively affect their mental health. This at-risk group requires support to maintain and improve their quality of life. My Tools 4 Care - In Care (MT4C-In Care) is a self-administered, multicomponent, flexible, and interactive website designed specifically to support family caregivers of PLWD in LTC to address this gap in service and the significant concerns about their mental health. The feasibility study in Alberta demonstrated that MT4C-In Care is informative, convenient, and easy to use; and shows potential to help caregivers cope with the transitions and adjustments beyond the PLWD's admission to LTC, increasing caregivers' hope and decreasing their loss and grief.||Purpose: The purpose of Phase 2 is to implement and evaluate MT4C-In Care to assess its effectiveness, and the influence of participant factors (i.e., gender, cultural background, age, etc.) on the use of MT4C-In Care across four Canadian provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario). The ability of MT4C-In Care to improve hope, self-efficacy, quality of life, social support, and mental health, and decrease grief and loneliness will be rigorously assessed in a pragmatic effectiveness trial with a large sample. The rigorous pragmatic trial, with in-depth mixed methods, will demonstrate whether MT4C-In Care works across four Canadian provinces as well as the reasons and mechanisms underlying its effects. MT4C-In Care will be updated based on pragmatic trial results in Jan-Feb 2022.||Participants: Total of approximately 280 participants from four provinces will be recruited (100 each from Alberta and Ontario and 40 each from Saskatchewan and Manitoba). Each province will hire a recruitment specialist, and Alzheimer Societies and other community partners within each province will support recruitment of participants by including information in newsletters, distributing brochures, and/or attending support group meetings, etc. Recruited participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control group (140 participants each group) via a centralized web-based randomization service (REDCap).||Data Collection: Trained research assistants in each province will 1) track all participants' participation throughout the study, 2) conduct surveys with all participants by phone to assess whether or not the intervention was effective in improving outcomes over time, as compared to the control group, and 3) conduct in-depth telephone interview with five to fifteen participants (depending on the province; see below).||Number of Participants in Surveys and In-depth Interviews: Alberta and Ontario: surveys with all 100 participants and in-depth interviews with 15 participants; Saskatchewan and Manitoba: surveys with all 40 participants and in-depth interview with 5 participants.||Outcome Data Collection: Immediately before and after the intervention, outcome and process data will be collected from all caregivers.There will be 3 Data Collection Points: Baseline before the start of the intervention; 2-month follow up immediately post-intervention; 4 month follow up after the end of the intervention.||Data Analysis: Outcome will be analyzed (using Generalized Estimating Equations) to assess whether MT4C-In Care is effective in the intervention as compared to the control group over time. We anticipate that the intervention group will experience improved hope, mental health, quality of life, social support, and self-efficacy, and less loneliness and grief, as compared to the control group. 140 participants in each of the intervention and control groups will allow for rigorous testing of these hypotheses.",Dementia

NCT04154215,"The purpose of this research is to assess whether dynamic FDG-PET scans and quantitative analysis of the these scans can give a more accurate and sensitive information regarding the DLB brain glucose metabolism which in turn may give better insight about DLB mechanism and allow better assessment of the disease.||Glucose metabolism in the brains of DLB patients is characterized by a pattern of bilateral parietal and posterior temporal hypometabolism with specific occipital hypo metabolic signature [9]. The use of FDG-PET scans allows the mapping of the topographic hypo metabolic view of the brain in different stages of the DLB condition. These metabolic maps, in turn, can be used both for diagnostic purposes as well as for research of the DLB mechanism [10] [11]. FDG is also a modality assisting in the differentiation between AD, PD and DLB [12]. To notice, the disadvantage of the FDG-PET scans is the lack of quantification. Visually analysis of brain FDG metabolism without quantitative analysis is limiting its use as a biomarker and the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity of the scan. This is the main reason why it is considered only a supportive biomarker [9].||In these study the investigators will investigate the utilization of dynamic FDG PET scans in order to track in more close and precise way the path of the glucose metabolism in the brain. In addition, the investigators would like to use the dynamic scans to perform quantification of the FDG distribution in the brain in order to show the advantage of the quantification in the diagnostic process.",Dementia
NCT04271943,"With the positive contribution of technological developments to living conditions and improvements in health services, the ratio of elderly population to general population is increasing all over the world. The slowdown in the process speed, which also explains the slowdown in learning speed in geriatric individuals, is the modality most affected by aging. It has been reported that cognitive speed decreased by 20% at the age of 40 and by 40-60% at the age of 80. Motor speed also decreases with aging. Cognitive decline and deterioration are among the most feared in the elderly.||Dementia is one of the most common diseases of old age. The prevalence of dementia increases in societies where the elderly population increases. At first, while memory is impaired, functions such as attention, language, visuospatial skills, perception and problem solving are impaired. Attention is the first non-memory cognitive domain affected by dementia. Personality changes, behavior and psychiatric symptoms, physical activity problems, vestibular balance and gait problems are added to the table. Although data on the prevalence of dementia are variable, studies are consistent in showing that the prevalence of elderly disease is increasing. It is estimated that the number of people living with dementia in the world is now 35.6 million, and it will reach 131.5 million by 2050.||Since there is no treatment or effective disease modifying drug to treat the most common types of dementia to date, the research should focus on the development and implementation of non-pharmacological interventions as an alternative or as an additional treatment. Non-pharmacological interventions represent an important complement to standard pharmacological treatment in dementia. Cognitive, physical and psychosocial rehabilitation can improve global function, mental status, and quality of life. These interventions can further reduce social costs. Different approaches such as cognitive rehabilitation, occupational therapy, physical activity, music therapy, art therapy and other interventions have been proposed. Interventions that reach patients before they can be diagnosed with dementia can have the greatest impact. Therefore, it is desirable to develop interventions that are moderate, perhaps diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, or that target those known at risk.||In the field of rehabilitation; regular physical exercises, such as walking, strength and balance exercises can improve physical and cognitive functions such as daily and executive functions, language and working memory in people living with dementia. Movement activation groups such as psychomotor group therapy have been found to have a positive effect on the social behavior of people living with emotional and dementia. Recent meta-analyzes have shown that physical exercise can help maintain and even improve cognitive function in healthy elderly adults. There is evidence that exercise increases the volume of the prefrontal cortex and anterior hippocampus and may increase neurogenesis.||Since there is no effective treatment for dementia, early diagnosis of symptoms and identification of methods that slow down the progression of the disease have been the main focus of relevant medical research in recent years. While treatments remain unclear, older adults and families are seeking accessible, affordable and effective ways to prevent or improve mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Exergame is a unique form of dual task training that combines physical exercise with cognitive compelling tasks in an interactive game-based way. Unlike the more traditional motor-cognitive dual task exercises that combine different training tasks, the preliminary examination typically involves cognitive challenges directly placed in physical body movements that must be performed to complete the game tasks projected on a screen. Since Exergame is a convenient, relatively safe and fun way to be physically active, it is expected that it will positively affect any negative subjective norms related to exercise.||Computer-based cognitive education has received great attention as a safe, relatively inexpensive and scalable intervention aimed at protecting cognition in older adults. It is an innovative way of exercising in a virtual reality or game environment that can help dementia patients to be physically active while being cognitively stimulated.||It was seen that the number of studies on this subject is small and the devices used in the studies were made with game consoles and there were problems in working with game consoles in patients with dementia. Within the framework of all this information, we aimed to investigate the cognitive effects of physical activity and their differences according to each other with computer assisted exergame study written for rehabilitation in demented individuals; We aim to increase cognitive functions and increase quality of life and reaction time of exergamine dementia individuals.||The study is planned to be carried out in a special care center between April 2019 and May 2020 with the patients who are between the ages of 11-25 and the Mini Mental State Scale (MMSE) aged 65 and over.||Inclusion Criteria:||65 years or older and MMSE scale between 11-25|No traumatic brain injury or stroke history||Exclusion Criteria:||Cooperation problem|Unstable or severe medical condition,|Presence of Bipolar Disorder or Psychotic Disorder|Any co-morbidity that prevents exercise.||The study was planned as a randomized controlled clinical trial; The cases will be divided into two groups by simple randomization method.

NCT02814773,"With nearly one million cases of dementia in France in 2010, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related syndromes are a major public health issue. The lake of drug for treatment or preventing AD, health related quality of life (HRQoL) became an essential criterion of evaluation to assess the treatment strategies of patients. Generic HRQoL tools are generally less sensitive for a given disease. That is why other specific tools for AD have been developed. None of them was validated in French. The aim of this study was therefore, after a review of the literature, to achieve a cross-cultural adaptation and psychometric validation of the ""Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease"" (QoL-AD) and ""Dementia Quality of Life"" (DQoL).

NCT01363258,"Nursing home (NH) residents with dementia are often dependent on others for mouth care, yet will react with care-resistant behavior (CRB) when receiving assistance. The oral health of these elders deteriorates in the absence of daily oral hygiene, predisposing them to harmful systemic problems such as pneumonia, hyperglycemia, cardiac disease, and cerebral vascular accidents. The purpose of this study is to determine whether CRBs can be reduced, and oral health improved, through the application of an intervention based on the neurobiological principles of threat perception and fear response. When faced with a threat, all organisms react with ""flight-fight"" responses. These responses are both autonomic (e.g. elevated heart rate, sweating) and behavioral (e.g. moving away, attacking). Persons with dementia have heightened threat perception as a result of neurobiological changes that affect the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. These individuals may interpret mouth care as a threatening action by threatening people. The intervention, called Managing Oral Hygiene Using Threat Reduction (MOUTh), combines best mouth care practices with a constellation of behavioral techniques that reduce threat perception and thereby prevent or de-escalate CRB. The primary specific aims of the study are to: 1)Evaluate the efficacy of the MOUTh intervention for reducing CRBs in persons with dementia; 2)Validate the overall efficacy of the MOUTh intervention using nurse-sensitive oral health outcomes--swollen and bleeding gums, cleanliness of the oral cavity, saliva, and integrity of the lips and oral mucosa; and 3)Calculate the cost of the MOUTh intervention. Using a randomized repeated measures design, 80 elders with dementia from 5 different NHs will be randomized at the individual level to the experimental group, which will receive the intervention, or to the control group, which will receive standard mouth care from research team members who receive training in the proper methods for providing mouth care but no training in resistance recognition or prevention/mediation. Oral health assessments and CRB measurements will be obtained during a 7-day observation period and a 21-day intervention period. Individual growth models using multilevel analysis will be used to estimate the efficacy of the intervention for reducing CRBs in persons with dementia, and to estimate the overall efficacy of the intervention using oral health outcomes. Activity-based costing methods will be used to determine the cost of the MOUTh intervention. At the end of this study, the research team anticipates having a proven intervention that prevents and reduces CRB within the context of mouth care. Long-term objectives include testing the effect of the intervention on systemic illnesses among persons with dementia; examining the transferability of this intervention to other activities of daily living; and disseminating threat reduction interventions to NH staff, which may radically change the way care is provided to persons with dementia.",Dementia

NCT03152630,"Around 10% of stroke survivors develop dementia within 3 months after stroke and over 20% more stroke patients have dementia in the subsequent 3 years. Previous studies documented a close relationship between stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are, however, no reliable biomarkers to detect cognitive dysfunction and dementia among stroke patients or to predict the risks of vascular dementia (VD) and AD among patients with stroke. There is a clear need to identify novel mediators of cognitive dysfunction in stroke patients to provide insights into the pathogenesis, to tailor clinical care based on risks, and to develop new therapeutic strategies.||It has become increasingly clear that the transcription of the eukaryotic genome is far more pervasive and complex than previously appreciated. While the expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) account for only ~1% of all transcribed species, up to 90% of the mammalian genome is transcribed as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a heterogeneous group of non-coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. LncRNAs have been shown to be functional and involved in specific physiological and pathological processes through epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. While the roles of lncRNAs in human diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders are beginning to emerge, it remains unclear how lncRNA regulation contributes to cognitive dysfunction and dementia in stroke patients. Exosomes are small vesicles of endocytic origin that are released into the extracellular environment and may participate in signal transduction between cells. Exosomes from central nervous system can penetrate blood brain barrier and can be collected from serum. Recently, exosomes had been shown containing several kinds of important protein and RNA and played roles in post diseased cell survival and death. Our previous studies focus on the specific inflammatory responses in neurons receiving ischemic injury. We have used blood samples in acute stroke patients to verify the relationship between specific signaling proteins in inflammatory pathways and post stroke functional outcome. Besides, our ongoing project also found that exosomes released from neurons with oxygen glucose deprivation may be related to the post stroke inflammation.||NIR spectroscopy is a revolutionary new device allowing the measurement of oxygenated and de-oxygenated hemoglobin concentrations in tissue. The device works by emitting Near Infrared (NIR) light into tissue at known diffusion path from a detector. Once the absorption and scattering are determined, the assumption that hemoglobin is the only significant absorber is applied and the oxygenated and de-oxygenated hemoglobin concentrations are calculated. The applications of the NIR spectroscopy include but are not limited to Peripheral Vascular Disease, Cardiothoracic & Vascular Surgery, and Neurosurgery. We have also developed a prototype of near-infrared spectroscopy. The preliminary findings and possible clinical value of this technology has been proven.||In this proposal, we seek to apply next-generation sequencing technology to investigate circulating lncRNA expression, as well as exosomal RNAs in the subjects with and without cognitive dysfunction or dementia. In addition, we will apply the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to evaluate cerebral blood flow, metabolism and oxygenation in these subjects. We will test the hypothesis that circulating lncRNA/exosomal RNA signature and NIRS imagaing can reflect the cognitive states in stroke patients. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the lncRNA-exosomal RNA-NIRS-based cognitive dysfunction scoring system will then be tested in an independent, large validation cohort. Next, we propose to test the hypothesis that circulating lncRNAs/exosomal RNA and NIRS imaging can be novel prognostic biomarkers to predict cognitive dysfunction and dementia in stroke patients.

NCT01550172,"Informal caregivers provide the majority of care for chronically ill adults, including persons with dementia. While these individuals provide a great benefit to the chronically ill relative, being a caregiver is associated with deleterious health consequences, including premature mortality and higher rates of coronary heart disease (CHD). Another common complaint among dementia caregivers is poor sleep, which has been connected to premature mortality and higher rates of CHD in noncaregiving adults. Currently no sleep therapies are empirically validated as effective for caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD), and since PWD often arise at night, improving caregiver sleep could be potentially hazardous as a sleeping caregiver cannot provide supervision during night awakenings. Our primary purpose is thus to determine whether a combined intervention is effective in improving sleep in caregivers of PWD who arise at night. The intervention consists of a night home monitoring system that provides reliable alerts to caregivers when PWD leave the bed and move through the house. While this system improved home safety for PWD, it did not affect caregiver sleep, so a more traditional sleep therapy will be added-cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia. In the proposed study, experimental participants will receive the night home monitoring system + CBTi; active comparator participants will receive the night home monitoring system and sleep behavioral therapy. Participants will remain in the study for 29 weeks, with 4 data collection points. We hypothesize experimental participants will have less time awake after going to bed, and improved sleep efficiency (percent time asleep while in bed). Sleep data will be collected for multiple nights using actigraphy and sleep diary. Our secondary research questions focus on the relationship between poor sleep and CHD. Both in adults and in dementia caregivers, there appears to be a link between poor sleep and abnormal levels on coronary heart disease biomarkers, and likely an increase in CHD with poor sleep. We aim to further explore this relationship as well as determine whether levels of biomarkers improve with improved sleep from the intervention. We propose to draw blood samples at 4 data collection points and measure a set of biomarkers indicative of CHD.",Dementia
NCT00035191,"In a previous 6-month study in patients with both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's dementia, galantamine demonstrated positive results on thinking, functioning, behavior, speech and overall well being of patients, and prevented the behavior symptoms of dementia from appearing. This combined study consists of two almost identical 26-week studies that examine the same criteria as the previous study, but in a larger patient population (dementia has been identified as having been caused by blood vessel disease without Alzheimer's disease). The study starts with a 4-week period in which current medications for dementia are withdrawn followed by a 26-week double-blind treatment period when patients will receive either placebo or galantamine 8 milligrams or 12 milligrams twice a day. Effectiveness will be measured by changes in scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Scale, the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus, and the neuropsychiatric inventory, as well as (in English-speaking countries only) a 10-minute interview of the patient (EXIT-25 scale). Safety will be evaluated throughout the study based on the incidence and severity of unexpected events, laboratory and physical tests, and vital signs. The hypothesis of the study is that galantamine will improve thinking, function, behavior, speech, and overall well being, better than placebo. A voluntary pharmacogenomic study will be incorporated into the study plan to evaluate whether specific genes are related to the dementia or drug response. 8 milligrams (mg) 2 times a day for 8 weeks, then increasing to12 mg, if tolerated.

NCT03284112,"Public awareness of Cardinal Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms remains low. Adults often underestimate personal dementia risk; minority populations are more likely to have low dementia literacy and be unaware of it. Cultural dementia belief in minority groups are complex and pose barriers to diagnosis, with dementia symptoms being considered a part of normal aging, or that discussion may be taboo even when recognized. A key barrier to timely AD diagnosis in African Americans is delayed physician contact, often years-long, following the onset of first symptoms. Despite studies demonstrating that dementia concepts first develop in elementary school periods, apart from our work, no dementia awareness programs focus on children. This intervention therefore addresses a major gap regarding optimal approaches for shifting cultural perceptions of dementia in low-income minority populations and reducing barriers to its timely diagnosis.",Dementia

NCT04305951,"Currently, there are about 100,000 people aged 65 years and older who are suffering from clinically diagnosed dementia in Hong Kong (HK). With an ageing population, this number will increase to 280,000 by 2036. Most dementia elderly live in community dwellings, such as nursing homes and elderly day care centers. Dementia is the major cause of disability and dependency in elderly people. It poses a significant burden on caregivers, families, and the public healthcare system. Patients with dementia not only have a wide range of cognitive impairment, including progressive memory loss, increasing difficulty in communication and language, concentration and attention, reasoning and judgment, but also develop a variety of frailty-related symptoms, mainly including physical and psychological frailty, such as musculoskeletal deterioration, neurological disorders, sleep, emotional, and even psychotic symptoms. The overall purpose of the management of community-dwelling dementia elderly is to reduce dementia- and frailty-caused adverse outcomes that increase disability, dependency, hospitalization, and long-term care admission. However, there is a dearth of effective interventions improving the quality of life of community dwelling elderly with dementia. The development of holistic management strategies that not only prevent and slow cognitive deterioration, but also reduce various other symptoms is therefore highly desired.||Acupuncture has been widely used in the local clinical practice. Numerous studies have shown the benefits of acupuncture in reducing cognitive deterioration in patients with cognitive impairment and dementia and animal models. Acupuncture is also effective in improving physical disability, rigidity, gait, and postural balance in aging adults with stroke and Parkinson's disease. A large body of evidence further confirms the effectiveness of various acupuncture regimens in treating pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression. On the other hand, it is well demonstrated that, as a convenient therapy, acupressure has particular benefits in alleviating sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and agitation in elderly with dementia. Acupressure also has positive effects on the recovery of motor function and daily activities of stroke patients. These studies suggest that a combination of acupuncture and acupressure could produce greater and broader benefits for the elderly with dementia.||Most recently, we have completed three clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of acupuncture treatment of vascular dementia; stroke-caused cognitive deterioration , and chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. All these trials have consistently revealed that acupuncture was effective in alleviating cognitive impairment. We also have shown the effectiveness of a caregiver-performed acupressure on the general quality of life in frail older people and self-administered acupressure for insomnia disorder. The caregiver-performed acupressure protocol is called 'Comfy Acupressure for the Elderly (CAE)' and demonstration video is accessible at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAqNIZPKmnM. Furthermore, our several studies have confirmed the efficacy of acupuncture in improving major depression ; insomnia and anxiety, poststroke depression and movement disability. Meanwhile, we have developed a novel acupuncture mode called comprehensive acupuncture therapy (CAT) that consists of dense frontal acupoints with additional electrical stimulation and multiple body acupoints. The efficacy of CAT has been well proven in our previous studies.||These studies have led us to hypothesize that CAT, CAE, and a combination of both as a holistic intervention could produce additive and even synergistic effects than routine care in improving cognitive impairment, frailty-related disability and dependency as well as comorbid symptoms in aged people with dementia.||The working hypothesis is that CAT, CAE, and a combination of both (CAT+CAE) could produce better management outcomes than routine care in improving cognitive impairment, frailty-related disability and dependency as well as comorbid symptoms of community-dwelling aged people with dementia. To test this hypothesis, an assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial will be conducted to examine whether CAT+CAE could produce greater and broader improvement than routine care and even than CAT and CAE alone in improving cognitive deterioration and comorbid symptoms in community-dwelling elderly with dementia.",Dementia

NCT00200538,"Background: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the first cause of dementia in the presenium (onset before the age of 65 years). Characterized by behavioral disorders, it is often more incapacitating than Alzheimer's disease (AD), and leads to death within 7 years on average (9-10 years for AD). It affects young individuals (on average, 20 years younger than in AD), who are often still active. Management of these patients is therefore burdensome and complex. As opposed to AD, however, no treatment is currently available. Few therapeutic trials have actually been conducted on this disorder. Many reasons may account for this:||recent availability of reliable diagnostic criteria (the Lund and Manchester groups' consensus statement in 1994; revised in 1998),|the very small number of cases as opposed to AD-the number of cases was estimated at approximately 3,500 vs 600,000, for AD, in France in 2004-, FTD therefore falls into the category of rare diseases (i.e., less than 30,000 cases),|the scarcity of valuable physiopathological hypotheses.||Besides a non-specific serotoninergic dysfunction, no significant anomalies related to particular neuromediators have apparently been found (as opposed to AD, which is characterized by a cholinergic deficit). In 1998, the discovery of mutations in the Tau gene in certain kindreds showing a dominant autosomal transmission of FTD, oriented research efforts toward the tau protein and provided new perspectives. Many studies have suggested the role of excitotoxicity. Abnormal aggregation of the tau protein has been observed in the brains of a majority of FTD patients (familial and sporadic form). Excitotoxicity may be responsible for promoting this abnormal aggregation through modification of the expression and phosphorylation state of the tau protein. The hypothesis of this study is that an anti-excitotoxic neuroprotective treatment may slow the pathogenic process and therefore be an effective treatment for this pathology.||Goals: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of memantine (anti-excitotoxic, neuroprotective treatment currently used in AD) in FTD patients after a one-year treatment.||Type of study: National, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, phase II therapeutic trial.||Study design: Sixty four (64) patients, aged 45 to 75 years, will be enrolled in the study for a period of 12 months (clinical inclusion criteria are defined based on the Lund and Manchester group consensus statement [revised version 1998]), and followed up for 1 year in a controlled study. At the time of inclusion, the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score should be at least 19 (below 18, a neuropsychological examination is impossible). Patients will either take memantine, or a placebo (randomization ratio of 1:1) twice a day (i.e., 20 mg of memantine per day in the memantine arm). The primary efficacy variable will be a global assessment tool, the CIBIC-Plus (Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input). Secondary efficacy variables will include behavioral scales [the NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Frontal Behavior Inventory (FBI)], cognitive scales [the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS), the MMSE], activities of daily living (Disability Assessment for Dementia, DAD), time spent by the caregiver of the patient (Resource Utilization in Dementia, RUD), and caregiver burden scale (Zarit Burden Inventory), and tolerability of the drug. The main analysis will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis in all randomized patients having undergone at least one evaluation after inclusion (the Last Observation Carried Forward LOCF value, will be attributed to missing values). This analysis will be carried out at the end of the double-blind study (main judgement criterion)||Expected results and perspectives: The main expected result is the confirmation of the efficacy of memantine as a treatment for FTD, which would set a precedent in the treatment of this disease. Such a result could also lead the way to the development of treatments for other related neurodegenerative disorders (tauopathies) such as the other frontotemporal lobar degenerations (semantic dementia, progressive non-fluent aphasia), progressive supranuclear palsy, or corticobasal degeneration.

NCT04347668,"Dementia is a term used to describe a collection of symptoms including memory loss, problems with reasoning and communication, and a reduction in a person's ability to carry out daily activities such as washing, dressing and cooking. The most common types of dementia are: Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, mixed dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. Dementia is a progressive condition, which means that the symptoms will gradually get worse. Clinicians and families are looking for ways to deal with this challenging group of diseases to improve quality of life, reduce depression and agitation that often accompany dementia as it progresses and individuals are placed in long term care (LTC).||There are a variety of non-pharmacologic interventions for dementia ranging from traditional interventions such as behavioral therapy to newer interventions such as multisensory therapy. Often used in addressing physiological and behavioral challenges, some interventions have been shown to aid cognitive ability as well. ""Cognitive stimulation,"" is a catchall term referring to non-pharmacologic interventions with a cognitive focus, new to this category of treatment is virtual reality (VR).||Virtual reality has been studied in mild cognitive impairment. A systematic review of studies evaluating computerized cognitive training and virtual reality cognitive training interventions for individuals at high risk of cognitive decline called mild cognitive decline documented consistent improvement in the domains of attention, executive function, visual and verbal memory, and also on the psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety, and apathy in participants. Colleagues completed a systematic review of non-pharmacological intervention to treat older people with dementia and found music to be the only intervention effective, VR was not included as no studies were found.||The Registered Nurses Association of Ontario completed a best practice guideline on Dementia based on current evidence in 2016.

They recommend health-care providers should consider non-pharmacological interventions wherever possible as a first-line approach to the management of BPSD.||The most well-studied and effective non-pharmacological approaches include listening to music/music therapy, effective communication and person-centred approaches and other sensory stimulation. Virtual reality as proposed in this research will include music, specific library items will be selected that are person specific, and will provide sensory stimulation in keep with the RNAO guidelines.

NCT04254094,"Early-onset dementia (EOD), which begins before the age of 65, is less common than late-onset dementia but represents a significant burden for the patient, their family and the healthcare system. The descriptive epidemiology is poorly known, and the National Reference Center for young patients, using English data (Harvey et al., 2003) estimates the number of subjects concerned in France at 18,318. It is degenerative dementia that is the most common cause of EOD and among them, Alzheimer's disease and then frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) (Vieira et al., 2013). The natural history and prognostic factors of PDD are not well known, and only AD has some data. Alzheimer's disease (AD) in young people appears to have a worse prognosis than that in older people, but this is debated (Stanley and Walker, 2014) and also depends on the criteria studied: cognition, function or survival. Prognostic factors other EOD, and in particular frontotemporal dementias, which moreover are heterogeneous pathologies, are even less known.||Investigators have chosen to study the functional prognosis of patients because it is both very relevant to care needs and easy to measure.

NCT02727699,"This is a Phase II, randomised, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of oral Xanamem™ once daily in adult subjects with mild dementia due to AD.||Based on Xanamem™'s mode of action on hippocampal function, amnestic symptoms may respond best, thus favouring the inclusion of mild dementia due to AD, with given evidence of disease progression. Subjects will be treated in a double-blind fashion, where both the investigators and subjects will be unaware of the treatment assignments, to minimise any subjective or unrecognised bias carried by the investigators and subjects. Placebo will be used as the comparator in this study.||It is planned to randomise approximately 174 subjects at approximately 25 study sites in three countries (Australia, United Kingdom, and United States), with the aim to enrol 7 to 10 subjects at each study site. Subject enrolment will be competitive but a cap of 20 subjects per study site is to be established to avoid any site effects. In case the sample composition at one study site is creating concerns, an enrolment stop can also occur at fewer than 20 subjects.||The data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will periodically meet for the review of accumulating safety study data and will also be involved in the interim analysis.||At the Baseline visit (Week 0), eligible subjects will be randomised on a 1:1 ratio to receive either Xanamem™ administered orally QD (treatment group) or matching placebo (placebo group).

NCT03224143,"Primary goals The primary goal of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of Doll Therapy Intervention (DTI) versus a Sham Intervention (SI), on behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of PWD living in a nursing home. Outomes will be measured with the Italian version of Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home. It is expected an improvement in terms of a decrease in NPI-NH total score.||We will also assess the efficacy of DTI versus SI, on professional caregivers distress ratings related to behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of PWD. It will be measured with the Italian version of NPI-NH. It is expected an improvement in terms of a decrease in NPI-NH distress total score.||It will also assess the efficacy of DTI versus SI, on cognitive and physiological status of PWD. The first will be recorded as the presence or absence of exploratory and caregiving behaviors on an observational grid expressly conceived for this purpose (Grid 2, Appendix). It is expected an improvement in terms of an increase of the number and duration of exploratory and caregiving behaviors. The efficacy of DTI versus SI on physiological status of PWD will be measured by assessing blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), heart rate, and salivary cortisol that are biomarkers of acute stress. It is expected an improvement in terms of a decrease in these parameters.||All evaluations will be performed at baseline (T0) and thirty days later (T1). Secondary goal The secondary goal is to evaluate the stability of attachment behaviors of the PWD through the adminstration of the Adult Attachment Interview to the patients' offspring after conclusion of interventions. It is expected to find an association between the attachment style of the PWD and caregiving behaviors during the doll presentation (i.e. caressing the object, talking to it and smiling). Such behaviors are recorded in an observational grid expressely conceived for this purpose.||These observations will allow the investigators to test wether a relationship between present and past attachment style of PWD and between attachment styles and participant response to doll therapy exist. Investigators expect that PWD with a previous secure attachment style will accept the doll and will show caregiving behaviors, while the PWD with insecure attachment style will show, especially during the first contacts, rejection, avoidance of the doll or excessive caregiving reactions towords the doll. Investigators also expect that PWD with unresolved attachment style will show inconsistent responses to the presentation of the doll, with approaching and rejecting behaviors.",Dementia
NCT02585232,"Background: Dementia affects over 7% of Veterans age 65 and above seeking care through the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA), amounting to one out of every eleven Veterans in some VISNs. The unique functional and behavioral impairments associated with Alzheimer's or a related dementia (ADRD) contribute substantially to psychological and physical morbidity of family caregivers and high rates of nursing home placement, with 60% of ADRD caregivers rating the emotional stress of caregiving as ""high or very high,"" and over one third reporting depressive symptoms. Although numerous evidence-based interventions have been developed to reduce caregiver burden and improve mental health and functional outcomes of the person with dementia, a recent systematic review noted almost none of these interventions ""make it off of the shelf"" to be readily available in clinical settings. Care Consultation (CC) has emerged as a rare exception. CC is an evidence-based telephone intervention delivering psychoeducation, care coordination, and resource referrals in diverse areas such as safety and mental and behavioral health support. Yet CC's focus on coaching and support is inadequate for dyads experiencing high levels of distress. A stepped-intervention approach would address the VA's efficiency needs while allowing the flexibility for more resource-intensive additional counseling beyond the established CC framework when warranted by high dyad distress. This CDA-2 proposal would move such a dyadic intervention forward.||Objectives: 1) Manualize the integration of care consultation and counseling components (i.e., the CC+C intervention). CC+C is guided by a rehabilitation recovery-based conceptual model to address the most common high distress targets (e.g., relationship distress, Veteran or caregiver depression, anxiety, or pain) using patient-centered approaches. 2) Evaluate preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of the CC+C Intervention in a randomized controlled pilot study of distressed dyads to compare: a) the established CC intervention, to b) the CC+C intervention on Veteran and caregiver outcomes. 3) Conduct exploratory analyses of the CC+C intervention on Veteran long-term care placement at six and 12 months and examine two key treatment moderators (behavioral symptoms and spousal relationship status) that may impact intervention engagement and response to treatment.||The investigators hypothesize that: 1) Caregivers assigned to CC+C will have greater reductions in caregiver burden at 6 months than those assigned to CC alone. 2) Indicators of relationship strain (i.e., marital distress and/or mutuality) will show greater improvement in CC+C than CC at 6 months. 3) Gains in shared pleasant events, social engagement, and quality of life will be greater in CC+C than in CC alone at 6 months. 4) Participants with dementia in both groups will have reduced depressive symptoms at 6 months. The investigators will also explore the impact of the two interventions on rates of placement in long-term care facilities (such as nursing homes, VA Community Living Centers or other supportive living environments) at 6 and 12 months.||Methods: Ten modules combining successful elements from existing manualized therapies and exercises developed by the investigative team during the CDA1 period will be integrated with CC into a draft CC+C intervention manual. The manual will be finalized with input from the mentoring team and an Expert Advisory Panel for completeness, feasibility, and safety and risk considerations. Next 68 distressed Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers will be recruited and randomized to either the CC+C intervention group or the CC comparison group. Patient, caregiver, and relationship outcomes (e.g., burden, depressive symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, relationship distress) will be measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Treatment implementation and feasibility data will be collected.||Anticipated Impacts: The goal of this career development study is to acquire the knowledge, skills and experience necessary to successfully compete for an RR&D Merit Review Award evaluating a randomized controlled trial powered to establish efficacy and test effectiveness of the CC+C intervention. Rehabilitation-focused interventions that maximize functioning are essential for successful non-institutional VA dementia care in the future. Work completed during the CDA2 period will serve as a foundation for a career committed to this goal. The impact of this work will be realized when an efficacious and highly-accessible intervention, such as the telephone-based dyadic intervention being piloted, becomes available for aging Veterans and their families.",Dementia

Debriefing can be provided upon request. Then the participating physicians will help to identify eligible dyads; while one trained research assistant (RA) is responsible for CM implementation (RA I), and the second RA (graduate students, RA II) will be responsible for data collection in each time point.||To increase the feasibility of this project, the inclusion criteria of PWDs are made to reflect the recruiting site reality, including: (1) age being older than 60 years old; (2) having a primary FCG or a secondary FCG who can provides sufficient information and assistant for the PWD; co-residence is not required; (3) PWDs are those with cognitive impairment confirmed by the primary or secondary FCG or participating neurologists. The exclusion criteria of PWDs include: (1) acute illnesses, impaired sensory symptoms (hearing loss and severe visual problems); (2) acute agitation which requires emergency treatment; (3) chronic alcohol abuse or use of drugs which possibly affect central nervous system functions; (4) presence of major psychiatric disorders within the last 2 years; (5) neurological or systemic illness (e.g. delirium, hypoxia, or unstable thyroid dysfunction); (6) no primary FCG or secondary FCG.||Investigator will screen for FCGs who report and meet the criteria of moderate levels of severity in the following risk areas (Table 1): depressive symptoms, burden, distress to problematic behaviors of PWDs and healthy behaviors. The definition of primary FCG include: (1) age 18 years old or greater; (2) at least providing the most assistance (4 hours a day) to their relatives with dementia for the past three months or those who conduct secondary care to their relatives, meaning that these FCGs supervise the hired care assistants or foreign helpers who actually take care of the patients; co-residency is not required for family caregivers. Exclusion criteria of family caregivers include: (1) documented cognitive or mental disorder, such as severe memory problems or major affective disorders; (2) hearing or visual impairments which are not properly corrected; (3) prescribed drugs known to impair or enhance attention, e.g., antidepressants, barbiturates, or other depressants, amphetamines; (4) insufficient command of Mandarin, Taiwanese; (5) participation in other interventions which may contaminate the results of this study.||In previous project, the satisfactory level of our case management training course was high. All the trainees had the highest regard toward the professional quality of the content and the instructors (Chiu et al, 2013). One of the case managers served as research assistant in the previous project and will continue to work with us as interventionist upon funded. Investigator will conduct a three-year RCT involving repeated measures at four time points: baseline screening (T0), 4th month (the end of the intervention, T1), 6th month (post-treatment follow up, T2), 12th month (T3).||Randomization Randomization takes place after baseline assessment. An external independent person establishes the random order using random number tables.||CM Intervention Protocol The 4-month CM intervention on FCGs of PWDs involves 2 home visits, 2 phone calls from the case manager to the dyads, and receiving telephone calls from FCGs during the working hours (Monday through Friday, 9-5). The case manager will target the prioritized risk from the 4 risk areas of FCG problems: depressive symptoms, burden, distress to problematic behaviors of PWDs, and healthy behaviors (Table 1). The intervention mainly consists of 1. needs assessment and nursing education on home environment modification and safety, behavioral management and communication skills(Belle et al., 2006); 2. home-based cognitive stimulation on PWD with simple mathematical practice (Cheng et al., 2013), patient preferred leisure activities (Chiu et al., 2015) and reminiscence by old time photos, stories and toys (Chiu et al., 2013); 3. brief consultation on 4 risk areas related to FCG stress (Belle et al., 2006) and 4. case management to refer the dyads to the hospital-based dementia centers and community resources (Chien et al., 2010). The case manager will assess the recruited dyads at the beginning of the intervention (T0), develop a tailored care plan based on the prioritized risk area of the FCGs and conduct the first home visit in the 1st month to build up a partnership with FCGs, discuss the care plan with the FCGs (and PWDs if possible). Each risk area of each FCG will be dealt with CM components such as education, brief counseling, problem solving and evidence based strategies derived from the Pearlin's theoretical principles. The case manager will teach the FCGs how to implement the home-based cognitive stimulation and cognitive training for PWDs and provide them the daily log for recording these activities and any leisure-time physical activities as well as medical cost. There will be two telephone calls in the 2nd and 3rd months to reinforce the dyads about the taught strategies, collect the log data and remind them the date of the next home visit (4th month). If the problems in each risk area persist until the first phone call, the case manager will discuss this case in a multidisciplinary conference in the participating dementia centers with nurses, social workers, clinical psychologists and neurologists. Then a revised care plan will be developed and additional home visit will be conducted in the 3rd month. If it is necessary, the case manager will refer the dyads to the hospital-based dementia centers, memory clinics or governmental resources. The frequent contacts are to ensure the CM strategies can reflect the changing needs of the FCGs. The definition of compliance is 80% of CM strategies completed by the dyads. The outcome data will be collected after the recruitment in the 4th month (T1), 6th month (T2) and 12th moth (T3) either by home visits or dementia center or memory clinic visits.||To ensure the quality of medical care, both group participants will be followed up at three monthly intervals in the dementia centers. PWDs of the experimental and control groups will receive standard medical treatment as clinically indicated.||For the control group, after the initial assessment, the case manager will give the dyads written information about dementia and its progress as well as home safety during the first home visit. Then case manager will make 2 phone calls in the 2nd and 3rt months for social interactions with the control group and collect the cost data. These phone calls do not involve in active education, consultation or cognitive stimulation and training. The control dyads will remain their usual care, i.e., visiting their primary care physicians or special neurologists for treatments or related consultation as well as education. The participating physicians will be unaware of the dyads allocation to either intervention or control condition. The dyads in the control group have no access to most of the structured and tailored activities. The outcome data will be collected at the 4th month (T1), 6th month (T2) and 12th month (T3)",Dementia

NCT03645694,"This project develops a novel social support aid (SSA) to allow persons with memory concerns (PWMCs) to more fully engage in their social network and enhance their quality of life. The SSA will assist people in an early stage of dementia, e.g., Alzheimer's disease or related dementia, who desire social interaction, but struggle to remember names and relationships. It provides memory cuing by displaying the names and relationships of the people with whom PWMCs are engaged. The investigators anticipate that the SSA will offer robust support for care partners and PWMCs in various communities. The SSA is not intended to replace caregiver aids, but rather augment them to further improve quality of life. Millions of Americans have dementia, the loss of mental functions, e.g., thinking, memory, and reasoning, which interferes with their daily functioning. While some cases of dementia are caused by medical conditions that can be treated, most cannot be reversed. Hence, the focus switches from treatment to palliative care, i.e., developing a plan to make life easier and more comfortable for individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Assistive technologies to enhance living with dementia, let alone studies that evaluate their efficacy, are underdeveloped. The proposed project aims to begin filling this scientific and clinical gap by developing a social support aid and formally evaluating its utility via a sufficiently powered randomized controlled trial.||This phase II Small Business Innovation Research project will continue work started in phase I and complete a product. The aim of this human subjects research protocol is to evaluate whether the SSA exerts positive benefits for PWMCs' social connections, communication, and quality of life via an embedded experimental mixed methods design that combines the collection and analysis of qualitative data within a traditional randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. The investigators hypothesize that the proposed SSA will exert positive benefits on the social connections, communication, and quality of life of people in early stage dementia.",Dementia

NCT00814658,"A double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician know the name of the study drug), 6-month, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the combination of galantamine with nimodipine in patients with mixed dementia on cognition and quality of life. The target dose of galantamine is 24 mg/day and nimodipine will be taken in fixed doses of 90 mg/day. Primary outcomes will be measured by a computerized battery of neuropsychological tests and Quality of Life (QoL) scores. Secondary outcomes will be measured by ADAS-cog, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Mixed dementia (Alzheimer's Disease (AD) associated with cerebrovascular disease) is one of the most common causes of dementia, which remain largely underdiagnosed. Little is known about specific treatments for this condition. Ischemic lesions by themselves seem to play an important role in cognitive impairment, even in the presence of AD pathology. Hypotheses: - Galantamine 16-24 mg/day in combination with nimodipine 90 mg/day is superior to galantamine monotherapy (16-24 mg/day) in improving or stabilizing cognition in patients with AD associated with cerebrovascular disease (mixed dementia), as measured by the CNTB at 6 months. - Galantamine 16-24 mg/day in combination with nimodipine 90 mg/day is superior to galantamine monotherapy (16-24 mg/day) on QoL measures in this population as measured by QoL - AD at 6 months.

NCT02914366,"The increasing prevalence of dementia is a serious threat to the medical system and society. About 500,000 Canadians are affected with dementia, and this number will rise to more than 1 million in the next 20 years. Dementia already costs the Canadian economy 15 billion dollars per year. While much of the focus of dementia is on Alzheimer's disease, autopsy studies suggest that up to 30% of dementia is due to diseases caused by abnormal alpha-synuclein accumulation (Synucleinopathies) such as Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD). People with Parkinson's disease (PD) typically present with motor symptoms, but the disease is also characterized by insidious cognitive decline, increasing in relation to disease duration. Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is a degradative enzyme that resides in a subcellular compartment called the lysosome, and cleaves a neutral glycolipid, glucocerebroside, present in the plasma membrane of most cells. GCase is intimately linked with PD. Being an ""asymptomatic carrier"" of a GCase mutation is currently the highest genetic risk factor for PD, with some studies suggesting up to 1/3 of patients carry mutations.||Reductions in GCase activity most likely also plays a role in sporadic PD, as these patients have lower levels of GCase in their brain and cerebrospinal fluid, even when they do not carry a mutant GCase allele. Reducing GCase genetically or pharmacologically in animal studies results in cognitive impairment. The aggregates causing the impairment can be cleared by re-introduction of normal GCase back into the brain. In addition, overexpressing GCase in the brain of a PD mouse model improves cognition. GCase therefore appears to be an excellent target for a therapy that addresses the underlying pathophysiology of PDD to improve or stop disease progression.||Ambroxol is an expectorant that has been available over the counter in more than 50 countries for over 30 years. Recently, the Mahuran Lab identified Ambroxol by screening a library of compounds as an agent that stabilizes wild-type (normal) GCase. By stabilizing GCase, Ambroxol is able to markedly increase GCase protein and activity in normal and Gaucher disease fibroblasts at doses of 10 micromolar. Ambroxol can also increase GCase in normal mouse neuronal cultures to more than 150% of normal at a dose of 30 micromolar. Ambroxol has good lipophilicity (cLogP = 2.8) and low polar surface area (PSA 58 Å2), predicting good CNS penetration. Unpublished studies performed by ExSAR corporation demonstrate that in single and multiple dose experiments in rats, Ambroxol crossed rapidly into the brain and exhibited brain to plasma concentration ratios of greater than 10 indicating outstanding CNS penetration. Ambroxol has an excellent safety record, and has been studied in >15,000 patients in more than 100 trials. Ambroxol is sold over the counter in much of the world as an expectorant at doses of 75-120 mg/day. Furthermore, Ambroxol is considered so safe that it is approved for intravenous use in pregnant women at a dose of 1000 mg/day IV (15 mg/kg) to improve fetal lung maturation before preterm delivery. Clinical trials in more than 390 pregnant women have been performed using doses up to 3000 mg in one day and 1300 mg/day for up to 33 days. Critically ill neonates have also been given doses as high as 30 mg/kg for respiratory distress. The fact that Ambroxol has been used at very high doses in pregnant women and neonates suggests that these doses are safe. In pilot studies, Ambroxol was effective at improving GCase function in humans. In a trial aimed at non-neurological Gaucher disease, 12 patients received 150 mg/day for 6 months, and all but one had some measureable improvement. The best response was in the lightest patient (who received 3 mg/kg/day), suggesting that Ambroxol was under dosed. Ambroxol has also been administered to three Japanese Gaucher disease patients with severe neurological disease, at 1000-3000 mg/day for 12-31 months. These patients had improvements in seizure frequency and neurological symptoms; one patient regained the ability to sit unsupported and to walk.||Ambroxol has never been examined in PD or Lewy Body Dementia patients; however, trials of pharmacological chaperone therapy have been suggested in a recent review in the journal ""The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."" A successful outcome of this trial will greatly accelerate the development of therapeutics for neurodegenerative disease. This proposal outlines a completely novel pharmacological target for PDD, namely the enzyme GCase. It also proposes a completely novel therapy using the drug Ambroxol, an agent considered safe enough to give to pregnant women, which has improved GCase function in pilot studies in humans. This strategy could stop or reverse the underlying pathology of PD; it might allow patients to get better. Furthermore, re-purposing an existing medication with excellent safety record will greatly shorten the time to bring this therapy to general use, allowing us to leapfrog the normally decades-long drug development process.||This study will test the hypothesis that Ambroxol can improve the course of cognitive impairment or motor function in PDD by raising GCase levels in blood and CSF. The study specific aims will be 1) to demonstrate the efficacy of Ambroxol in improving, or slowing the progression of cognitive deficits, motor symptoms, or CSF/neuroimaging biomarkers, 2) to acquire additional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for use in future trials and 3) to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of Ambroxol in patients with PDD.||This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of Ambroxol 1050 mg/day in individuals with mild to moderate PDD. Participants will be allowed but not required to be receiving concomitant treatment in a stable regimen for Parkinson's disease and dementia. Eligibility for enrollment will be assessed initially at one or more Screening visits, which are to occur within 28 days of Baseline. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned (1:1) at the Baseline visit to one of the following two groups: Ambroxol 1050 mg/day or placebo.||Patients will be randomized to receive placebo or Ambroxol (1050mg). Participants randomized to Ambroxol group will begin with a dose of 225mg (3 mg/kg/day), increasing bi-weekly by ~3mg/kg to a dose of 1050 mg/day (~l5 mg/kg/day).||After 52 weeks, all patients will be offered a 6-month open label extension of Ambroxol 1050 mg/day.||For minor AE's (e.g. GI upset), patients will be allowed to spread the medication dose over a longer interval, or to reduce the dose to the highest dose tolerated. The dose can be advanced again after 2 weeks. For significant but non-threatening laboratory abnormalities, doses can be reduced to the highest dose tolerated. Patients will be allowed to stop taking medication if there is concern about a drug reaction of a clinically significant alteration in laboratory values. They can be re-challenged 2-4 weeks after these abnormalities have resolved.||If one experiences a severe allergic reaction that is possibly related to the study medication, the participant will be discontinued from the trial.||The dose-plasma level and plasma concentration-response relationships will be assessed by measuring plasma Ambroxol levels and lymphocyte GCase at baseline and 2 weeks after each dose escalation.

NCT04008342,"Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in people with dementia frequently evolve with progression of the disorder. Nonpharmacological interventions are the first-line treatment to control NPS in dementia. Multisensory stimulation (MSS) is a nonpharmacological intervention that is conducted by stimulating one or more of the five senses of the body with pleasant sensory experiences. This work aims to investigate the effects of a MSS protocol in elderly people with moderate to advanced dementia living in long-term care institutions in Brazil.||Methods: A specific MSS protocol was developed by the researchers for the study. Sixty elderly people with moderate to advanced dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating of 2 or 3 and a Mini-Mental State Examination score ≤17) were randomly allocated to intervention (n=30) and control (n=30) groups. The sample size estimation was established with a paired bilateral t-test with a 0.05 significance level. This sample size would have 80% power to detect a mean difference of 9.50 in the NPI scores from pre- to post-intervention and a standard deviation of 17.28, as proposed by Fu et al. (2013). The intervention group participated in 16 individual 30-minute sessions over eight weeks in a quiet room, and the control group received usual care.||The MSS program includes eight sessions. During these sessions, the five body senses (sight, taste, hearing, smell, and feeling) are stimulated using songs, fruits, fiber optic lamps, natural scents, among other stimuli, to promote interactions between the participants and the therapist, as well as the objects. In each session, at least two senses are stimulated in a safe, quiet and confidential environment. The sessions last 30 minutes and are conducted twice a week, on the same day and time whenever possible. Nonetheless, the session can be interrupted when the participant wishes or if the therapist observes that the patient is uncomfortable. A nondirective approach and one-to-one intervention were adopted.The MSS protocol was conducted by an occupational therapist. In this study, the eight-session protocol was used twice, that is, the protocol was repeated from the ninth session forward, but the protocol was customized for each participant by consideration of the participants' interests in previous sessions and the protocol rules.",Dementia
NCT02350127,"The goal of the proposed study is to perform a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a novel integrative group movement program called Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLIE) on function and quality of life in older Veterans living in the community with dementia. Dementia is a devastating condition that affects nearly 1 in 10 older Veterans (~1 million individuals). Current dementia medications have minimal impact on function and quality of life and do not stop or slow the disease course; however, there is growing evidence that behavioral interventions such as exercise have a variety of beneficial effects in individuals with dementia. PLIE was developed based on recent discoveries in neuroscience and experimental psychology that have found that, although explicit memory (the ability to consciously recall new information) is impaired in individuals with dementia, implicit memory (unconscious learning that typically occurs through repeated exposure) is relatively preserved. Therefore, PLIE focuses on training procedural memory (unconscious learning of procedures) to build the strength and capacity to perform the movements that are most needed for daily function (e.g., transitioning safely from sitting to standing). In addition, to maximize the benefits of the training, PLIE integrates elements of Eastern and Western exercise modalities to develop mindful body awareness and enhance social connection. The investigators completed a pilot study of the PLIE program at an adult day center in San Francisco, CA, finding that it was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in cognitive function, physical performance and quality of life as well as reduced caregiver burden when compared with usual care at the facility. The current study will enable the investigators to build on these pilot study results by performing a full-scale RCT at adult day centers in Northern California. Most VA Medical Centers currently contract with community-based organizations to provide adult day care to eligible Veterans with dementia. Therefore, sites for the current study will be adult day centers that have current contracts with local VA medical centers. Within each center, study participants will be randomly assigned to receive the PLIE intervention program (1 hour, 2-3 days/week, 4 months) or Usual Care (UC) control (standard center activities, 1 hour, 2-3 days/week, 4 months) (N=120, 60/group) using a waitlist design. The co-primary outcomes are 4-month change in physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB), cognitive function (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale, ADAS-cog) and quality of life (Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease, QOL-AD). Changes in caregiver feelings (Caregiver Burden Inventory, CBI; Positive Aspects of Caregiving, PAC), mood (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS), fear of falling (Falls Efficacy Scale, FES), independence (Disability Assessment for Dementia, DAD) and dementia-related behaviors (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI) will be examined as secondary outcomes. To account for the waitlist design, all outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4 months and 8 months.

It is directly responsive to Request for Applications (RFA) RX-14-011 (RR&D Merit Review Award for Research on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease), which has identified ""pioneering new and innovative rehabilitation methodologies to restore function and improve quality of life for Veterans living with [these] neurodegenerative diseases"" as a ""major focus."" Many patients and caregivers currently feel that little is being done to help individuals with dementia maintain function and quality of life.

If the program is successful, the investigators will work with VA and community-based organizations to implement PLIE more broadly.",Dementia
NCT02814422,"Because of the rapid aging of the global population, dementia has become a serious problem, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Population studies have shown that dietary fats influence risk and progression of age-related diseases including AD, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Consumption of saturated fat, trans-fatty acids and cholesterol are positively associated with increased risk. These findings support the hypothesis that dietary saturated-fats (SFA) and cholesterol, or dietary induced dyslipidemia are causally associated with AD risk. AD is pathologically characterized by substantial neuronal loss and chronic inflammation that is associated with cerebrovascular and parenchymal accumulation of proteinaceous deposits enriched in amyloid-beta (Aβ). More recent evidence shows it is due to an increased blood-to-brain delivery of circulating Aβ, and significant peripheral Aβ metabolism occurs in association with post-prandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.||In the prodromal stage of AD, patients usually suffer mild cognition impairment (MCI). The annual conversion rate of MCI to AD is around 10%, and within 3 years, around 30%-50% of these develop dementia. Brain atrophy is an irreversible brain disease that causes problems with cognitive and memory functions in many diseases, such as MCI and AD, etc. In order to allow preventive intervention for AD, MCI must be diagnosed as early as possible, using biomarker assays or simple imaging modality. From 2009-2013, the investigators have registered 4,492 patients with atherosclerotic vascular diseases (AVD).

NCT04247347,"With every passing minute, a family member in the United States becomes an informal caregiver for an elder with Alzheimer's disease or another related dementia, which can be highly distressing and adversely affect the caregiver's mental and physical health. Similar to caregivers of persons with bipolar disorder, who are currently participating in the parent study for which this supplement is proposed, caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's or related dementia have been found to experience greater distress than caregivers of persons with other chronic conditions. They have significantly more mental and physical health problems than the general population, leading to greater use of mental health and primary care services and resulting in their inability to continue to provide care for their family members. Thus, although the trajectories of the two conditions (bipolar disorder versus dementia) may differ, we propose that caregivers of persons with dementia may benefit similarly from tailored health self-management interventions, including resourcefulness skills or biofeedback training, more than the educational materials or programs they are typically offered. Therefore, the caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia to be sampled in this administrative supplement will comprise an additional study arm for the randomized controlled trial constituting the parent study.

NCT02617056,"Objective(s): The key goal of this project is to develop methods for objectively monitoring and, ultimately, predicting outbursts of aberrant behaviors commonly seen among patients with a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions: dementia, PTSD, TBI, and schizophrenia. This initial study will be on patients with dementia. The analytic focus is on the measurement of electrodermal activity (EDA), a widely-studied physiological recording that indicates sympathetic tone; the central hypothesis in this approach is that sympathetic tone will increase prior to an outburst and, therefore, may allow therapeutic interventions to prevent it. Alterations of sympathetic activity have been implicated in the literature for each of these four conditions. Here, EDA recording holds the advantages of requiring neither effort nor communication on the part of the subject, and of being a noninvasive procedure. These factors make EDA potentially useful for the clinical assessment of arousal among patients with dementia, which will be the first of the specific groups studied under this protocol.||Research Design: The general design of all of these studies is the monitoring of EDA in subjects with a small device that can be worn on the wrist, ankle or arm; patterns of spontaneous EDA will then be assessed for features that may predict the occurrence of an outburst. In the initial study of dementia patients, the investigators will first survey EDA responses in commonly used paradigms (e.g., visual stimulus, EDA response). Currently, little is known about EDA in this population, and the investigators redress this by (1) establishing behavioral and physiological baselines for each subject in the study, (2) determining how these two classes of dependent measures cohere, and (3) evaluating whether patterns of EDA differ as a function of aberrant behaviors that are often seen in dementia: wandering, combativeness, and ""sundowning"" (agitation that typically develops late in the day). These behaviors are often grouped in the literature under the term ""disorders of arousal"", and are clinically well known to present as signs of disorientation and in some cases, distress. (4) Moreover, quantitative assessment of EDA change conceivably may reveal patterns that may signal the onset of problem behaviors.||Each subject will serve as his/her own control, providing within-subject measures of EDA signal over time and its correlation with aberrant behaviors. It is worth noting that the key EDA measures are not subject to bias based on experimenter ratings. Further, the aberrant behaviors will also be rated over time, using quantitative rating scales for each of them. In a second class of analyses, the investigators will perform group contrasts of subjects with and without these aberrant behaviors, as operationally defined by rating scales, to determine if patients with these problem behaviors are distinctive as a group with respect to EDA patterns. All statistical analysis will be performed on anonymized data, blind to group membership.||Methodology: EDA will be measured by standard techniques in all subjects: electrodes may be placed on the hands, feet, ankles, wrists, or arm according to preference and configured to measure conductivity or potential. In one portion of the study, a wearable device to measure EDA will be used to determine whether EDA predicts the occurrence of an outburst. In the study with dementia patients, assessments will be performed at an inpatient dementia care facility at the Bedford VAMC (GRECC). Over a two-year period, the investigators anticipate enrolling 60 subjects. Recruitment criteria include toleration of the EDA recording device worn on the wrist (similar to a watch) or the ankle. Skin potential, skin conductance, and membrane electrical power will be monitored and data recorded electronically. Data will be de-identified by assigning the serial subject number to each patient; a table linking the number to the subject's identity will be kept on a secure VA server, allowing re-identification after data analysis.|Findings: If successful, EDA may predict an outburst of aberrant behavior with enough lead time to permit a preventive intervention.|Clinical Relationships: The investigators hypothesize that: (a) stable physiologic baselines can be obtained for EDA measures, (b) EDA signals are altered as a function of aberrant behaviors (""disorders of arousal"") on a within-subject basis, and (c) group differences will emerge between samples of patients with and without these aberrant behaviors.|Impact/Significance: If the EDA were borne out as a sensitive measure of disorders of arousal, this measure may find application in the assessment and treatment of dementia.",Dementia
NCT03282877,"Scientific justification:||Since the use of technology is rapidly increasing in every aspect of many people's daily lives, previous research has already begun to investigate its application and implementation in multiple areas within dementia care. An example of an area where technology and dementia come together is computerised cognitive interventions. These types of interventions build on the added benefits of computer use such as reduced cognitive decline in older adults and lower risk of receiving a diagnosis of dementia among older men with the added benefits of using one's cognitive capacities. In a recent systematic review, Garcia-Casal et al. (2016) concluded that computerised cognitive interventions led to significant improvements in cognition, depression and anxiety among people with dementia. Computerised cognitive interventions may have more of an impact on cognition than non-computerised cognitive interventions.||In a randomised pilot trial conducted by Tárraga et al. (2006) which was included in Garcia-Casal's review, people with mild Alzheimer's Disease were allocated to a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group consisted of both a computerised cognitive stimulation programme and a non-computerised, face-to-face cognitive stimulation programme delivered in groups. The control group consisted solely of the non-computerised, cognitive stimulation programme. The results showed that that people with mild Alzheimer's Disease showed greater improvements in cognition lasting for 24 weeks in the treatment group which suggests added benefits of a computerised cognitive stimulation programme.||These positive findings suggest that it is worthwhile to continue conducting research in the area of computerised cognitive interventions. Interestingly, Garcia-Casal et al (2016) have pointed out that the area of computerised cognitive stimulation (which is an area of computerised cognitive interventions) is relatively underdeveloped. Most computerised cognitive interventions are geared towards cognitive training.||At the moment there are multiple, paper-based cognitive stimulation interventions available of which Cognitive Stimulation Therapy is being used more predominantly in the UK. CST is a brief evidence-based psychological treatment for people with mild to moderate dementia. It consists of mentally stimulating and engaging group activities which have shown to improve cognition and quality of life in a large scale randomised controlled trial. More recently, an individualised version of CST (iCST) was developed which is a home-based version of CST administered by informal carers (e.g., friends, family members). The content of the sessions is similar to those of CST. A multi-centre RCT of iCST showed no improvements in cognition and QoL for people with dementia, nor evidence of improvements in carers' mental and physical health. However, people with dementia receiving iCST reported a better relationship quality with their carer, and carers reported an improved health-related QoL. These findings indicate a need for further research to determine the effectiveness of carer-led cognitive stimulation interventions for people with dementia since most people received fewer than recommended number of iCST due to low adherence.||Since there is a need for more research in both the area of computerised cognitive stimulation and carer-led cognitive stimulation, this research sets out to develop and evaluate the potential benefits of iCST adapted for delivery by an interactive (touch-screen) web-application in a feasibility study. The investigators are setting out to combine the added value of computer use and the beneficial effects of CST/iCST in order to produce benefits in cognition and quality of life. A participatory process while developing the web-application in the form of consultations, focus groups and interviews will be employed. Preliminary consultations with people with dementia and their carers have already given the investigators information on attitudes towards (touch-screen) technology, both appealing and non-appealing features of applications and desired length/duration of iCST.||The investigators hope to see signs of improvements in quality of life and cognition after using the iCST web-application. If this is the case, this could lead to a larger randomised controlled trial with more participants to formally establish effectiveness. An iCST web-application has the potential to be more accessible for people on a national and an international level when adapted to appropriate cultural contexts compared to paper-based manuals. Lastly, the iCST web-application could be used long-term and could rapidly become widely used as a clinically and cost-effective standardised, and feasible intervention.||Design and methodology:||The focus groups and interviews will be a multi-centre study to gain insights and perspectives from people with dementia and their carers regarding the usability of the iCST web-app. This will enable the investigators to optimise the developmental process and learn about the experiences of the participants while they interact with the web-application. Observational and transcribed audio-recorded data will be collected from the focus groups and interviews which will be semi-structured in nature.|The feasibility study will be a multicentre, pragmatic, single blind, randomised 2 treatment arm (iCST web-app vs treatment as usual) study over 11 weeks.||In accordance with good research practice, the investigators have decided to run a feasibility study prior to running a larger randomised controlled trial in order to assess the usability of the iCST web-application and the feasibility of running a larger-scale randomised clinical trial. With this feasibility study the investigators will be able to gain insights with regard to recruitment/drop-out rates, adherence, sample size, appropriateness of outcome measures, changes to made to the web-application etc. This will all be necessary information before a larger trial can be conducted.||Programme development:||The iCST web-application will be adapted from the paper-based iCST manual. The amount of sessions will be reduced from 75 to 21 after consultations with people with dementia and carers pointed out that the paper-based iCST manual contained too many sessions. Multimedia within the web-application will be used and participants will be given the opportunity to provide ongoing feedback on the web-application itself after completing each session. The research team will work together with all the stakeholders such as the software company employed to build the web-application, the people with dementia, and their carers. Regular consultations, focus groups and interviews should aid the development of the web-application in ensuring it is feasible, practical and appealing.||Recruitment for the study:||Recruitment for the focus groups, interviews and feasibility study will take place in a variety of community settings in Nottingham consisting of both primary care settings (outpatient clinics) and secondary care settings (community mental health teams (CMHTs), memory clinics, care homes, day centres, and voluntary sector organizations such as the Alzheimer's Society). By including a variety of settings, the reach for people with dementia and their carers will be extended. The PhD student will make close links with the aforementioned services and organisations through attendance and regular contact. In addition, the distribution of information leaflets and posters to organisations and professionals involved in the identification of possible participants will facilitate the recruitment process.||The initial approach will be from a member of the person with dementia's usual care team. If the person with dementia and carer are willing and suitable for participation, the PhD student will fully inform them about of all aspects pertaining to involvement in the study through in person conversations and information leaflets. It will be explained to the potential participant that; (i) entry into the study is entirely voluntary and that their treatment and care will not be affected by their decision, (ii) they can withdraw at any time but attempts will be made to avoid this occurrence and (iii) in the event of their withdrawal their data collected so far cannot be erased and we will seek consent to use the data in the final analyses where appropriate.||Sample size:||The sample size estimation for the focus groups and interviews is based on previous work in the iCST study. For the current study, four focus groups with six participants each (one with people with dementia, one with carers, two collaborative groups) and ten interviews (five with people with dementia and five with carers) will be conducted.||The investigators have estimated the sample size to be 60 participants. This is partly based on previous work with iCST considering the numbers recruited and the amount of centres involved in the iCST trial. The iCST trial recruited 356 participants over eight sites across the UK (Bangor, Devon, Dorset, Hull, Lincolnshire, London, Manchester, Norfolk and Suffolk). This equals to an average of 45 dyads per site. We will have an equal distribution of dyads across the two groups leading to 30 dyads per arm (iCST web-application vs. treatment-as-usual). The field-testing phase of iCST (without a control group) included 22 dyads which roughly resembles the sample size for the current feasibility study.||A sample size of 60 participants will be sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the iCST web-application with an effect size of 0.80 with 80% power and 5% significance (two-tailed). The effect size has been chosen based on the sample size.||Timetable:||Focus groups/interviews (start from May 2018 onwards):||3 months recruitment;|4 months running of groups and interviews in Nottingham recruitment|6 months analysis and writing up findings||Feasibility trial (start from November 2018 onwards):||5 months of recruitment;|7 months of running feasibility study;|5 months analysis and writing up findings",Dementia

NCT01761227,"This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Fufangdanshen Tablets in patients with vascular dementia. All patients will initially receive placebo for a 2 weeks period and then will receive Fufangdanshen Tablets or placebo for 6 months. The primary measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline to the end of treatment in the ADAS-cog/11 score (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale: sum of 11 cognitive items) and the CIBIC-plus score (Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change - Plus Caregiver Input). Additional measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline to the end of the treatment in the MMSE score (Mini-mental State Examination), the ADL (Ability of Daily Living) score.

NCT04141878,"The 8-month diet and AEx regimens used here are theoretically motivated by implementation science and use the best available practices to treat multisystemic disabling processes. The recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) review of Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) implementation literature found that 1 hour per week is the optimal length and frequency to balance cost and attentional demands of the participants. DPP class structure generally involves a 10-min weigh-in, a discussion of adherence to personal weight loss and exercise goals, formal DPP content delivery, and lastly a discussion of barriers to adherence. Diet module content focuses on calorie restriction by altering the composition of participants' meals. These goals include reducing trans-fats, saturated fats, sodium, and carbohydrates and increasing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fiber. Participants set weight reduction goals for themselves with personalized goals between 5% and 10% of total body weight dependent on the participant's level of obesity - effectively replacing prepared foods with traditional (Mediterranean) diet.||Because cognitive abilities do not appear to change without a corresponding improvement in cardio respiratory (CR) fitness, the 8-month AEx module content optimizes CR fitness improvement with in-class walking workouts and tutorials. All health instructors at TICE and EOSC will have at least an Associates level degree in exercise physiology and be required to have personal training certification. They will always be under the direct supervision of the PI. Direct supervision of the participants by these health instructors will occur for all exercise sessions until the weekly duration target of 150 minutes a week is reached (Week 6). We introduce more flexibility in scheduling exercise when the participant is consistently and safely meeting their goals by allowing unsupervised exercise sessions at the facility when exercise trainers may not be available (i.e. early morning, nights, and weekends). Participants are still required to have at least one directly supervised exercise session per week to maintain contact with program staff and encourage adherence to the program. Unsupervised exercise sessions are conducted similarly to supervised exercise and session data will be reviewed by the exercise instructor at the weekly supervised session.||Per a well-developed literature on DPP best practices,159,160 we will limit intervention class sizes to about 20 people. Over the course of 5 years, we will run 30 to 35 full DPP groups, each session meeting weekly for 20 consecutive weeks of diet-focused or AEx-focused intervention.||Previous studies suggest that salivary hormones such as cortisol, alpha-amylase and testosterone all measure glucocorticoid (GC) sensitivity, a potent biomarker of age-related stress. We will measure three stress markers in spit before and after a participant exercises during the 6-minute walk challenge at baseline and at each follow-up visit. Because better fitness is believed to improve one's reaction to stressful events, changes in these hormones may reflect the adaptation of a person's ability to cope with emotional and physical stress as they become more cardiorespiratory fit.",Dementia
NCT03638284,"Agitation and aggression impose a tremendous burden on the individuals living with dementia, their families, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia (NPS) affect up to 80% of patients with Alzheimer's dementia. These symptoms include aggression and agitation, anxiety, depression, hallucinations, and delusions. These symptoms impair patient and care giver's quality of life, increase the chances of hospitalization and also result in faster progression of the illness. The efficacy of current treatments is limited and the antipsychotic medications commonly used to treat these symptoms are associated with serious side effects including cerebrovascular events, falls and increased risk of death. Electroconvulsive Therapy may be effective as well, however it requires anaesthesia and adversely affects cognition. Non-pharmacological or behavioral interventions are universally recognized as the first line treatment for agitation and NPSD. They are most effective when individualized and delivered in a person centered approach. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses a very low intensity electric current to modulate cortical excitability and brain plasticity. tDCS can be safely administered to awake persons and is very well tolerated. Studies in healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease have shown that tDCS applied to frontal brain regions can enhance cognitive function. Further, tDCS applied to frontal brain regions can improve depressive symptoms. The effects of tDCS on NPSD are not known. In this study the investigators will use tDCS to treat agitation related to NPSD.The objective of this proposal is to conduct an open label pilot study of tDCS for treatment of agitation.",Dementia
NCT01867359,"Dementia is a condition of declining mental abilities, especially memory. Dementia can occur at any age but becomes more frequent with age, with a prevalence of 5%-10% in people over 65 and 20% in people over 80. Dementia affects the rate of information processing, short term memory is affected before long term memory. It is difficult to diagnose between even the three most common types: Alzheimers disease, Lewy Body disease and multi infarct dementia.||Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically complex and heterogeneous disorder. It is the most common form of dementia, accounting for about 50-70% of typical, late onset cases of dementia. To date, mutations in three genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) have been described to cause familial early-onset AD. In addition, a common polymorphism in the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE) has been associated with the more common late-onset form of the disease. Genetic variability at the APOE locus is a major determinant of late onset Alzheimer s disease. Recent estimates suggest that these four established genes account for less than 30% of the genetic variance in age of onset for AD and predict that numerous AD genes may exist.||Lewy Body Disease includes a range of disorders: Parkinson s Disease, Dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson s dementia, among others. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) accounts for 20% of all cases of dementia in old age. Clinically DLB is characterized by cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Lewy bodies are neuronal inclusions comprised of abnormally truncated and phosphorylated neurofilament proteins, alpha-synuclein, ubiquitin and associated enzymes. Mutations in the alpha synuclein gene were first discovered in 1996 in a family with autosomal dominant Lewy body parkinsonism. However, most lewy body parkinsonism is not due to a variant in the alpha-synuclein gene. The importance of alpha-synuclein is attributed to the finding of antibodies to alpha -synuclein stain Lewy bodies in brains of all Lewy body disease cases. The ability to identify underlying genetic influences that result in different synuclein pathologies is key to understanding these disorders.||The first aim of this protocol is to collect families with a history of dementia in an attempt to clone the causative gene defect(s) via linkage and positional cloning. Our experience with the cloning of the Amyloid Precursor Protein mutations in Alzheimer s disease shows that this approach leads to a better understanding of the biochemical and physiological processes underlying the disease.||It is clear there are numerous forms of dementia where disease does not appear to be inherited in a Mendelian manner. Whilst these may be caused by environmental effects it is also reasonable to hypothesize that disease may be caused by complex genetic interactions. Furthermore, the susceptibility to environmental influence may be affected by genetic predisposition. As a second aim in this protocol, we will investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms and dementia. This will be performed by a candidate gene approach, assessing the contribution of genes already associated with familial forms of disease, likely candidates (for example involved in the cholinergic system, cell survival or Beta Amyloid processing) or genes within a genetic region previously linked to disease. Although significant association does not imply a causal relationship between the presence of the variant and disease, the pathophysiologic significance should be studied further. The inevitable problem of false positives within this type of analysis is a real one, which may be addressed by independent replications and tightly controlled experiments. Undeniably the analytical effort needed to differentiate positives from false positives is considerable, and as can be readily seen in Alzheimer s disease, the literature is scattered with positive associations and subsequent refutations. However, it is important that research groups continue to identify and replicate these studies.",Dementia

NCT04043364,"The provision of economically viable and proper care for the growing group of home-dwelling people with dementia (PWD) is one of the most pressing issues in our society. While a cure for dementia is not yet available, professionals and policy-makers highly prioritize the support of caregivers who experience a vast burden.

NCT00294554,"This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel, double-blind 24-week prospective study of memantine at the dosage range 5-20 mg/day in 20 outpatients with idiopathic PD and dementia secondary to PD. Using the dosage escalation regimen approved for Alzheimer disease, subjects will start memantine or comparable placebo at 5 mg daily and advance 5 mg/week to 20 mg /day by week 4, with dosing at 10 mg bid. Subjects will undergo 7 clinical visits over the 6-month trial (Screen, Baseline/Week 0, and Weeks 4, 8, 14, 20, and 24). The dosage can be titrated downward in increments of 5 mg to a minimum dose of 5 mg/day in the event memantine is not tolerated at the scheduled dosages. This broad dose range is being used because 1)a favorable cognitive response may be evident at lower doses of memantine than recommended for AD and 2)adverse effects could emerge when typical AD dosing recommendations are used, as has been observed when treating PD patients with cholinesterase inhibitors. Subjects will remain on a stable dose of memantine/placebo after Week 8, unless precluded by adverse events. Ten subjects will be assigned to each treatment group. Randomization will be stratified according to whether subjects are taking a concomitant cholinesterase inhibitor. This will enable secondary group comparisons of treatment groups.

NCT00376051,"Objectives: A hallmark of frontotemporal lobar degeneration(FTLD) is its associated behavioural disturbances (BPSD), which include disinhibition, aggression, apathy, agitation, depression, and inappropriate affect. Current evidence suggests that secondary changes in the serotonergic system may be key to many of the symptoms of FTLD. Our primary objective is to evaluate the ability of serotonergic dysfunction, as measured through oral citalopram challenge, to predict subsequent behavioural response to pharmacotherapy with citalopram. As a secondary objective, we will explore the relationship between specific BPSDs and the level of serotonergic dysfunction.||Hypotheses: We predict that patients with FTLD who respond to citalopram pharmacotherapy will show greater dysfunction in the serotonergic system, as measured by citalopram challenge, than patients who do not respond. This hypothesis will be evaluated in vivo using peak change in plasma concentrations of cortisol and prolactin as indicators of serotonergic dysfunction following oral citalopram challenge.||Research Plan: A consecutive sample of patients attending FTLD clinics who exhibit significant BPSD will be recruited into this study.Because serotonin promotes cortisol and prolactin secretion via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, these hormones have been shown to be a reliable marker of serotonergic functioning. Their levels will therefore be measured from blood samples taken at baseline and 2 and 3 hours after the administration of 20 mg citalopram. Changes in cortisol levels after citalopram administration will be used as the primary measure of serotonergic functioning. We expect to find an inverse correlation between the cortisol response to citalopram challenge and the severity of BPSD according to the total Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score. Subsequent to the citalopram challenge, participants will be treated for their BPSD with open-label citalopram (20-40 mg) for 6 weeks. At the end of this period, patients will be re-assessed with the NPI. The magnitude of response, based on changes in NPI scores, will be correlated with the citalopram challenge test results. It is expected that patients who show more severe serotonergic dysfunction will have a better response to daily citalopram treatment.||Relevance: The results of this study will further the scientific understanding of the neurochemical basis underlying BPSD in FTLD. To date, the treatment of FTLD patients has relied largely on the understanding of treatments for other dementias, due to the lack of research in the area of FTLD. Therefore, our work may aid in the development of targeted therapies specific to FTLD.",Dementia
NCT02038192,"Background: Hope is important for family/friends of persons with dementia residing in Long Term Care Facilities (LTC). Our research team has developed a program (Living with Hope) to increase hope and quality of life of family caregivers. The Living with Hope Program (LWHP) involves a) viewing the Living with Hope film which features caregivers of persons with dementia describing their hope and b) a hope activity entitled ""Stories of the Present"". The hope activity consists of participants writing at the end of the day about their thoughts, challenges and what gave them hope over a 4- week time period. For family caregivers of persons with advanced cancer, this LWHP has been found to increase their hope and feelings of self-efficacy (confidence in their ability to deal with difficult situations). Based on a qualitative study of hope of family caregivers of persons with dementia residing in LTC, the LWHP has been adapted to that population. A new Living with Hope film entitled ""Connecting with Hope"" has been produced and will be used in this pilot study.||Aims: The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the LWHP and collect preliminary data on the effectiveness of the Living with Hope Program for family members of persons with dementia residing in LTC.||Sample: Shannon Stachnik (Social Worker St. Joseph's Auxiliary Hospital), Arlene Huhn (Alzheimer's Society of Alberta - Edmonton) and Anna Mann (Alberta Caregivers Association) will identify potential participants based on the inclusion criteria.

NCT03847714,"Dementia is a disease that presents with deterioration in memory, thinking, behaviour and the ability to perform everyday activities. Worldwide 47.5 million people are affected and incidence of dementia is increasing. Dementia leads to disability and dependency among older people worldwide and thereby has a huge physical, psychological, social and economic impact on caregivers, families and society. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia accounting for 60-70% of the cases; other forms include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia and Parkinson's disease with dementia. In AD, pathologic protein aggregates of amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated tangles of tau-protein which deposit as neurofibrillary tangles are typical features. This leads to neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by the innate immune system. The most important cells in this process are microglia cells, which represent the resident macrophages of the brain. Although microglia is able to remove extracellular amyloid beta, in later stages of the disease cells remain in a dystrophic state and cannot exert their beneficial functions. Microglia maturation and function is critically dependent on short-chain fatty acids produced by the gut microbiome and therefore highlights the microbiome as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in dementia.||The role of the commensal microbial population of the human body - especially the intestinal microbiome - in various diseases is emerging due to the development of advanced analysis techniques. Recently the concept of the gut brain-axis has been established. Several pathways including the autonomic nervous system, the enteric nervous system, the neuroendocrine system and the immune system allow a communication between gut and brain but may also be involved in disease development.||During ageing, the gut microbiome composition undergoes changes. A decrease in diversity, a loss of beneficial taxa and an increase of facultative pathogens has been described. Diet and the place of residence play an important role in the shaping of the microbiome. Aging is also associated with inflammation - often termed as ""inflammaging"" associated with an increase in gut permeability, mucosal inflammation and bacterial translocation.||Since the main risk factor for developing dementia, especially AD, is aging, it is very likely that the gut-brain axis is critically involved in dementia development.||Animal studies so far suggest that AD is associated with changes in the gut microbiome composition with a decrease in beneficial, anti-inflammatory genera. Furthermore, genetic alterations in amyloid genes can influence microbiome composition in mice, pointing towards a vicious cycle in AD development.||In humans, so far only limited evidence on the microbiome composition in patients with dementia is available. There is evidence that the composition of the microbiome in subgingival plaques is altered in dementia and associated with cognitive function. Recently the first human study identified phylum- through genus-wide differences in bacterial abundance including decreased Firmicutes, increased Bacteroidetes, and decreased Bifidobacterium in the stool of AD patients.",Dementia
NCT03941119,"Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) (including hallucinations, delusions, aggression, restlessness, agitation, wandering, anxiety, depression, elation, euphoria, disinhibition, motor disturbances, nighttime behaviours, and appetite disturbances) represent an aspect of dementia particularly difficult to manage for which new treatments are urgently needed. Current means to manage BPSD typically involve medications (e.g. anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, sedatives) associated with negative side effects such as lethargy, loss-of-self, cognitive decline, and increased risk of falls, and/or applying physical barriers and restraints (alarms, locks, Buxton chairs, tethers) that can cause pressure sores, injury, infection, as well as negative psychological effects such as anxiety, distress, and aggression. Although options for non-pharmacological management of BPSD in acute care exist (e.g. reminiscence therapy, therapeutic touch, music therapy), they are seldom implemented in practice due to lack of time, resources, and/or training.||Exposure to natural environments (seeing greenery, hearing outside natural sounds) has been shown to enhance wellbeing, reduce depression, anxiety, and stress levels, and decrease hospital length-of-stay for inpatients. Through VR technology, one's surroundings can be seamlessly replaced by a virtual world of their choosing. Based on previous studies and expert consultation, we created a library of VR experiences depicting calming nature scenes (peaceful lake, refreshing forest, cheerful playground) designed specifically for people with dementia, as a prototype for introducing immersive VR-therapy to hospitals, long term care facilities and private homes.

NCT03593070,"Evidence indicates that Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD) family caregivers suffer long-term mental and physical health effects that place them at risk for premature death. They do not relinquish their role after placing a family member with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD) in long-term care. In fact, these caregivers experience increased symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, and chronic grief post-placement. In the long-term care (LTC) environment, caregivers' chronic grief is exacerbated by their lack of knowledge about late-stage Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD) and their sense of loss, guilt, and role captivity. Interventions targeting improvement of ADRD caregivers' mental health have focused overwhelmingly on in-home care. We tested a Chronic Grief Management Intervention (CGMI) with ADRD caregivers in in long-term care and found it feasible (recruitment, retention, and attendance). The Chronic Grief Management Intervention (CGMI) had significant effects on caregiver knowledge and mental health outcomes (heartfelt sadness/longing and guilt; aspects of chronic grief). Although caregivers reported high satisfaction with this intervention, many could not attend the 12 face-to-face group sessions due to the burden of time and competing responsibilities. Therefore, we reduced the number of sessions to 8 and adapted the Chronic Grief Management Intervention to be delivered as a live streaming video, online group intervention; Chronic Grief Management Intervention-Video (CGMI-V), using Adobe Connect (online platform) and iPads. We tested CGMI-V in a single group pilot study for feasibility (recruitment, retention, attendance and technology ease of use) with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD) caregivers post-placement. We obtained 100% retention with high caregiver satisfaction with the intervention and the online technology used to deliver it. Our proposed study, Chronic Grief Management: A Live Streaming Video, Online Intervention (CGMI-V) builds on these results and is guided by a Model of Dementia Caregiver Chronic Grief in the Long-Term Care Setting. The purpose of this study is to test the effects of the 8-week CGMI-V on a caregiver primary outcome (chronic grief); a secondary mental health outcome (symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, and positive states of mind) and a secondary facility-related outcome (caregiver satisfaction with care and conflict with facility staff) related to a minimal treatment (MT) control group. We propose to test the group-based Chronic Grief Management Intervention-Video (CGMI-V) in a Stage I longitudinal, randomized clinical trial. 144 Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD) caregivers whose family members reside in one of the participating long-term care facilities will be randomly assigned to either CGMI-V or MT condition. Caregivers in the Chronic Grief Management Intervention-Video (CGMI-V) condition will participate in 8 weekly live streaming video, online group sessions. Caregivers in the minimal treatment (MT) condition will receive written information about late-stage ADRD at baseline. For both conditions, data will be collected at baseline, 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) and then at 24 weeks post-baseline, using measures of caregiver grief: Marwit-Meuser Caregiver Grief Inventory(MM-CGI); depressive symptoms: Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D); anxiety symptoms: Stait-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); positive states of mind: Positive States of Mind Scale (POSMS); satisfaction with care: Family Perception of Care Tool (FPCT); conflict with facility staff: Family Perception of Caregiving Role (FPCR subscale), knowledge of Alzheimer's disease: Family Knowledge of Alzheimer's Test (FKAT), loss, guilt and role captivity (FPCR subscales). Specific aims are to: 1) Establish effect sizes of the Chronic Grief Management Intervention-Video (CGMI-V) condition and Minimal Treatment (MT) control condition on changes in caregiver chronic grief. 2) Establish effect sizes of the CGMI-V and Minimal Treatment (MT) control condition on changes in caregiver symptoms of depression and anxiety and on positive states of mind. 3) Establish effect sizes of the CGMI-V condition and the Minimal Treatment (MT) control condition on changes in caregiver satisfaction with care provided in the facility and conflict with staff, and 4) Explore mechanisms of intervention impact on all caregiver outcomes. Our long-term objective is to develop a chronic grief treatment modality that will be adopted in long-term care facilities as part of routine support for Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia caregivers post-placement.

NCT04281550,"Previous literature has shown that maintaining adequate hydration levels for residents with dementia can be challenging. This is due to difficulties with swallowing, remembering to get drinks or refusal to drink. Dehydration in people with dementia is a major problem and significant cause of admission to hospital (Bourdel-Marchasson, 2004; Hodgkinson, Evans and Woods, 2003). Despite this, there is limited research into hydration interventions for this population, despite preliminary evidence suggesting the potential benefits of using multi-component interventions (Bunn et al. 2015).||The primary aim of this feasibility study was to establish the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a definitive RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component hydration intervention for people living with dementia in nursing care homes compared to usual care.||Secondary aims were to establish:||Whether the Think Drink intervention can be delivered as planned within nursing care homes for people living with dementia|If the intervention is acceptable to care home staff|If it is feasible to recruit and randomise care home sites and participants|Barriers to the delivery of the Think Drink guide intervention.|If the outcome measures are feasible to use within a care home setting|If reliable data can be collected|A sample size calculation for an RCT. This study was a three-phase multi-method design consisting of analysis of the empirical grounds for the hydration intervention, development of a multi-component hydration intervention and a feasibility cluster trial of the intervention. The first phase constituted of a survey of care homes, a systematic review-informed review of previous literature and collection of professional perspectives. Second phase was the development the intervention through five workshop events. Finally, the feasibility phase compared 6 intervention homes and 5 control homes in North East England, over a 3-month period.||The literature review revealed three articles of limited quality and indicates that there has been limited multi-component interventions promoting hydration care following Bunn et al. (2015)'s original systematic review. Evidence available suggests the importance of combining functional and awareness-raising approaches within multi-component interventions. Professional perspectives also reinforced these findings. This was reflected in the development of the Think Drink Guide that had three interacting components. The 'policy' component was directed at the governance of the care home, whereas 'practice' components were directed at hydration procedures and processes, and 'educational' components that provided learning resources for care home staff to develop knowledge and understanding of hydration care. Think Drink was implemented through a short awareness-raising educational programme and accompanying information booklet detailing a range of practices (including organisational, system and individual practice) designed to encourage hydration.||Key Findings A total of 87 residents were included in the study, 37 as part of the control group and 50 in the intervention group. Overall, 45 care home staff from varied roles participated in interviews to determine the acceptance, barriers and facilitators of the Think Drink Intervention. No significant changes were found in terms of the primary outcome for residents (overall hydration consumption over a seven-day period) following the intervention. However, significant methodological concerns were noted over the use of care home-recorded data, particularly as accurate recording was a key focus of the education component and therefore not influenced in the control homes. It was noted from baseline that resident fluid intakes are inconsistently recorded in terms of detail (e.g. 200mls for a cup of tea offered, with no accurate recording of what was actually drunk). The change to more accurate recording in the intervention homes may have influenced the findings.||Qualitative data found that the training was well-received and valued by staff and care homes, particular in its influence of encouraging more frequent availability of drinks and greater variety of drinks offered. However, organisation and policy changes (such as the development of a specific hydration care plan) were not found. A further methodological concern was the lack of use of the Think Drink booklet, with staff suggesting they would prefer more accessible prompts, such as posters.||An a priori power calculation was carried out for a future trial in this area and, including attrition, it is estimated that 240 total participants would be required in a trial.||Key practice and policy recommendations||Hydration care requires development for residents with dementia across the care home sector. Although some aspects of this are being achieved within care homes and their respective companies, the findings from this study indicated that several improvements were achieved following implementation of the Think Drink intervention. It is recommended that practice and service developments to hydration care continue to be promoted.|Analysis of existing care planning processes indicates that hydration is not given a high enough priority, and where attention is given it often focuses on functional aspects of hydration care. More detailed information on cognitive issues or personal strategies for supporting hydration in individual residents could provide benefits in the future, particularly considering high levels of staff turnover in this area and a potential need for healthcare partners to access quick and accurate information about residents.|An important feature of the Think Drink guide was capturing hydration practices that are implemented in care homes in 5 domains - assessment of hydration norms and problems; hydration support and encouragement; drinking activities; drinking conducive environment; drinking equipment. The researchers recommend that further consideration is given to building on this range of hydration practices, and these aspects of hydration care should be incorporated into care home policy and care home commissioning processes.|Prior to future research further development of the format and presentation of the Think Drink practices domains, and related resources, such as posters, hydration apps or screensavers that can be displayed throughout a care home, to enable care home staff to raise their awareness of different approaches to hydration care and adopt these in their practice is required.|The implementation of Think Drink in care homes requires a flexible approach that is tailored to the care home setting. Care home-wide approaches (such as ordering a wide variety of drinks and beverages), ensuring all staff across all care home departments are competent to provide hydration care education (through inclusion of hydration education in induction programmes), and cascade models to promote excellence in hydration practice within a care home, should all be considered.|Hydration education was an important part of implementing Think Drink in care homes. The researchers recommend that care home staff receive hydration education, both during induction to working in a care home and through ongoing regular updates to contribute to proficiency in hydration care of residents.|Hydration education should also be available to commissioners so that they can contract and carry out quality inspection visits with understanding of the hydration requirements of residents and the challenges that care home staff experience in supporting residents to drink sufficient fluid.|The importance of accurate fluid recording should be included in hydration education for care home staff. Improvement in this aspect of practice will support care planning, implementation of effective interventions for those identified as having inadequate fluid intake, and communication with healthcare professionals when residents are referred to primary care and out of hours services due to deteriorating health.||Research recommendations||This was a feasibility study with the purpose of exploring issues of recruitment, testing the intervention and appraising outcome measurement tools. A recommendation for future research would be to increase the implementation period of Think Drink to 6 months to see if the short-term changes in hydration practice is maintained over time. This may require a larger scale study, however, due to high levels of participant attrition that is expected.|The findings highlight that there is poor documentation of hydration care planning and resident fluid intake. Some participating care homes developed novel approaches to improve the accuracy of fluid intake. The researchers would recommend further research to assess the feasibility of implementing these practices in other care home settings.|There was difficulty in recruiting care homes to the feasibility study that involved implementation of Think Drink and data collection over a 3-month period. In future research the timeframe for recruiting homes should account for lengthy recruitment processes.|The results demonstrate that there is a high level of attrition of care home residents and this should be considered when planning future research and in calculation of sample sizes.|Robustness of the data collected and outcome measures is a key consideration in the testing of any intervention. This feasibility study highlighted inaccuracies in the measurement of fluid intake and in any future study it is recommended that this is taken into consideration in future research and that this is undertaken by research staff. If research staff are present in care homes that provide services for people with dementia this could be disruptive and distressing for residents, hence the research methodology adopted in future research should enable researchers to participate in care whilst undertaking data collection. This will impact significantly on the funding required to undertake this type of research.",Dementia

Our experience with drugs called angiotensin cholinesterases (ARICEPT, EXELON, REMINYL) as with the NMDA antagonist (EBIXA) demonstrated that early initiation of treatment significantly slows disease progression Alzheimer, and other dementia syndromes (Vascular and mixed dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's Dementia Parkinson).||There is also the non-drug approach the patient exercises involving memory and attention, cognitive empowerment programs, therapy memories orientation to reality. Knowledge empowerment programs aimed at the exploitation of the cognitive functions of patients who remain at a satisfactory level. By using a wide variety of stimuli and specialized methods appropriately stimulated brain of patients and achieve the desired result.||The dementia in the early stages is not easy to diagnose because the public confuses the symptoms to those of normal aging. Still prevalent misconception that nothing can help these patients.||Recent studies have shown that demented patients are usually examined by a specialist 3 years after experiencing the first symptoms of the disease. This delay in diagnosis and treatment has a negative impact on the progress of the disease. Accurate and early diagnosis of dementia, ensure early intervention, smoother transition stages of the disease and a better quality of life for patients and their families for a longer period of time. It also allows further targeted prevention and treatment strategies, medical or otherwise.",Dementia
NCT02426398,"Participant recruitment||15 people with early AD will be recruited from the Sheffield Teaching Hospital and Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Trusts memory clinics. The STH clinic is neurology led and sees working age (<65 years old) patients while the SHSC clinic sees an older (>65 years old) population. Over 1300 new assessments are conducted every year. Approximately 65-70% are diagnosed with dementia.||Investigators will choose patients with typical neuropsychological profiles of AD. All patients will have previously been recruited to the Virtual Physiological Human: Dementia Research enabled by IT. VPH-DARE@IT is recruiting 30-40 participants in each of the three following groups (mild AD, MCI and normal controls) and thus our participants will be drawn from this group and all will have pre-existing high-resolution 3D structural and volumetric assessment plus resting-state fMRI scans. This resting-state fMRI data will be analysed to examine the DMN, allowing us to directly compare measures of brain-connectivity between EEG and fMRI and contrast the discriminatory ability of the two methodologies.||10 healthy controls will be aged matched and recruited either from Neurology clinics or be spouses of study participants. The investigators will endeavour to recruit normal controls who have undergone fMRI as part of the academic neuroradiology departments control population for VPH-DARE@IT and other studies.||People with AD and 10 healthy controls will have a repeat EEG to assess the reproducibility and robustness of the EEG measures.||EEG is normally very well tolerated and as listed in the background has been used in many people with dementia. The Clinical Neurophysiology department is very experienced in undertaking EEG in all patient populations from neonates to the very elderly.||Consent Participants will be identified by the clinicians working in the memory clinic or through posters in memory clinic and at other University sites to attract normal volunteers. A Participation Information Sheet (PIS) will be given to them either directly or via post. Participants will have sufficient time to read the PIS and be able to ask questions. The PIS will inform the participant of the benefits and potential risks involved in taking part in this study. They will be made aware of the possibility that incidental changes are rarely detected. If this is seen they would be informed and we would arrange appropriate management. The person will be consented when they come in for the EEG recordings. Investigators will explain to all participants that they will be able to leave the study at any time including during the EEG recording and in those that we plan to repeat the EEG can decline the 2nd test. The Clinical Department of Neurophysiology has experience in performing EEG in all ages including those with dementia and cognitive impairment. The person with dementia's care-giver or family member can come to the department and be in the room for the entire time the EEG recording takes place.||Methodology EEG data capture||Participants will attend the department of clinical neurophysiology and a member of the research team will take consent. Two experienced EEG technicians will place the electrodes and explain the procedure. We will record resting state EEG. Participants will be told to lie still with eyes closed. It will be explained that although their eyes are closed they must remain awake. Participants will be continuously monitored and if they become drowsy will be re-stimulated and the time of drowsiness will be recorded. This instruction and monitoring is the same as that used in previous EEG and fMRI studies looking at resting state paradigms.|The 10-10 International system of electrode placement will be used for the scalp EEG recordings with a multichannel high sampling rate amplifier (2 KHz). This will provide standard 10/20 electrode positions (F3, F4, F7, F8, C3, C4, Fz, Cz, T3, T4, T5, T6, P3, P4, O1, O2, and Oz electrodes) which will be initially used to detect the more significant spatiotemporal measurements/phenomena while offering the opportunity to elaborate on the spatial and frequency resolution of our findings at a later stage. Peri-ocular EOG electrode data will also be recorded to detect eye movement related slow wave activity. Investigators will therefore be able to avoid spurious estimates of slow wave activity in the anterior EEG regions.|Artefact free epochs within suitable (wakeful no task eyes closed state) will be selected and exported for further quantitative EEG analysis.|The exported data will be stored on an external encrypted drive.|All the analyses will be performed on custom made in-house software on a high tech computer located within secure offices locked within Dr Sarrigannis's office housed in the department of clinical neurophysiology.||EEG Data analyses • The error reduction ratio-causality method will be used to calculate levels of synchronisation. The standard EEG 10-20 electrodes, including all possible contiguous electrode combinations in pairs of two (e.g. right frontocentral versus parietoccipital) will be used in our pilot exploration to assess the 95% confidence interval levels of synchronisation and determine if they allow robust separation between healthy volunteers and patients with Alzheimer's Disease.||Other Data||• Qualitative Data collection: Investigators will collect questionnaires on the tolerability of undergoing EEG examination (please find enclosed questionnaire).||Ethical consideration Modern neuro-imaging using MRI is highly sensitive and can detect incidental findings. Our novel EEG analyses also have the potential to detect incidental findings. It is well known that spikes during an inter-ictal EEG have limited clinical significance. However they are seen more frequently in people who have a liability, or lowered threshold, for epilepsy. If any concern is raised about the EEG findings the participant will be reviewed by Dr Blackburn and if appropriate referred onto another neurological colleague. Any incidental findings detected by MRI will be referred to an NHS neurologist through the VPH-DARE@IT project researchers. The Patient Information Sheet and consent will make participants aware of these risks before they take part in the study.||Statistics This pilot project will explore EEG data to investigate the frequency and time domain measurement that would be most appropriate for clinical use. Investigators do not know whether this will involve linear or non-linear interaction and thus we cannot determine which is the most appropriate statistical test. The analysis of similar EEG data sets using parametric methods has explored this in more detail.||Power calculations As this is a proof-of-concept, pilot study to examine the robustness of a novel methodology, it is inappropriate to conduct a formal power calculation. Our initial findings will determine whether our EEG analyses detects functional connectivity correlates of the synchronisation of anterior and posterior networks identified by fMRI BOLD signal during resting state scanning. Investigators will also explore if our data is comparable to previously published quantitative EEG on people with AD. Investigators will explore which measures from our data can discriminate people with Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls. These initial results will give us likely effect sizes and allow us to conduct more accurate power calculations than are presently possible. This will be used to determine the sample size of a larger study of people with dementia.",Dementia
NCT04426838,"Up to 71% of the persons living with dementia (PLwD) and 70% of their caregivers experience sleep disturbances, which are distressing for both the PLwD and their caregivers. Specifically, PLwD often experience restlessness and fragmented sleep, which in turn can affect caregivers' sleep patterns leading to multiple nightly awakenings, shorter sleep duration, and/or inconsistent sleep-wake times. These disturbances increase the risk for a myriad of psychological, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological health issues and poor quality of life for the dyad. Given the interdependence of the dyadic sleep disturbances and the negative health consequences of sleep disturbances on the dyad, there is a critical need to develop and provide effective interventions to improve their sleep. Pharmacologic treatment often results in potential harmful side effects like falls and cognitive decline; therefore, non-pharmacologic approaches are recommended for this population.||Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), a non-pharmacologic intervention that has demonstrated effectiveness for improving sleep disturbances in multiple populations, is delivered in various formats including face-to-face and videoconferencing. Individually, PLwD and caregivers have successfully deployed behavioral sleep techniques, resulting in improved sleep quality. However, there is no current published research on CBTi completed simultaneously by the PLwD-caregiver dyad, and that is exactly what we seek to do with early-stage individuals and their caregivers. We premise this effort on the notion that a dyadic intervention can use early-stage individuals' retained capacity for communication and comprehension to establish in-the-moment agreements about strategies the caregiver can employ to enact and facilitate positive sleep behaviors in the PLwD and to pair that with acquired strategies to engender his/her own positive sleep behaviors.||This project seeks to gather formative and preliminary data on CBTi delivered simultaneously to the PLwD-caregiver dyad. The researchers will use a quantitative, descriptive approach to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 4-session CBTi intervention administered to 40 PLwD-caregiver dyads randomized to face-to face or videoconferencing sessions who will receive the intervention as a unit. Participants will be recruited through the Alzheimer's Association and the Goizueta Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Emory University. Objective and subjective sleep, depressive symptoms, and cognitive health data will be collected at baseline, and 1 week and 3 months post-completion of the intervention.||In community-dwelling PLwD and their caregivers where both persons in the dyad self-report sleep disturbances, the specific aims for this study are:||Assess the feasibility of a face-to-face or video conferencing dyad-based CBTi intervention.|Evaluate the acceptability of a face-to-face or video conferencing dyad-based CBTi intervention.|Examine the preliminary efficacy of face-to-face or video conferencing CBTi intervention on sleep quality outcomes including sleep efficiency and perceived sleep quality.",Dementia
NCT02403752,"Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a major public health challenge for our century. Research into pharmaceutical therapies has been disappointing and not provided any safe medications that can halt the disease's trajectory of decline in the cognitive, functional, emotional and social capabilities of the affected individuals. For non-pharmacological approaches, multi-domain exercise programs that address several of these capabilities in an integrated way have shown strong promise for their ability to slow the decline. The team of investigators has systematically developed one such program-the Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLIÉ) program-an integrative exercise program that uses procedural memory (memory for movements without explicit recall), can be taught at and integrated into senior day care centers and has been pilot-tested by our team with encouraging results for functional, cognitive and social outcomes (see Table 1).||However, (1) most people in the community do not have access to a day care center, are concerned about the stigma associated with day care or are unable to afford it. This was endorsed by semi-structured interviews conducted with caregivers and community-based organizations in preparation for a larger study of the PLIÉ program. There is a huge need for innovative programs to assist individuals with dementia and their caregivers in the community. Irrespective of having access to day care or not, motivated caregivers, who are aware of the benefits of exercises for their loved ones and spend hours alone with them at home, ask: ""What can we do with our [e.g. mother]?"" They point out a major lack of guidance for caregivers in the community to be able to use a regular exercise practice on a long-term basis at home. Caregivers and seniors with dementia living together in the community are dyads in need of a paired exercise program. (2) How exercise may delay cognitive and functional decline is unknown. One hypothetical mechanism of action is an improved brain oxygenation related to exercise. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method to assess regional cortical oxygenation levels, has been suggested for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia, but has never been applied to longitudinal studies in this population.||Paired home exercise programs for seniors with dementia and their primary caregivers have rarely been studied. A pilot study that used 6 'sticky hands' movement variations based on Tai Chi, music and exercise incentives found improvements in 2 outcome measures considered to be important in fall prevention (sit-to-stand time, one-legged stance time). However, movements were limited to tai chi and outcomes to fall-related function, leaving out cognitive function for which the PLIÉ program had shown such promising results.||The group of investigators is an established collaboration between the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine and the Department of Psychiatry at UCSF and has recently pioneered a novel, 45-minute, multi-domain program called Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLIÉ) that integrates physical activity (training of procedural memory for basic daily activities such as sitting and standing), cognitive stimulation (mindful body awareness), social engagement (group movement and sharing of in-the-moment experiences), and caregiver education (monthly home-visit). The investigators pilot-tested PLIÉ in 11 individuals with mild to moderate dementia who were attending an adult day program at the Institute of Aging in San Francisco, CA (ClinicalTrials.gov registered NCT01371214), and found (Table 1) preliminary evidence of medium to large, clinically meaningful effect sizes com-pared to usual care (UC; 45 minutes of usual chair-based exercises at the day care center) across a wide range of out-comes including measures of quality of life (0.83), cognitive function (0.76), physical performance (0.34) and caregiver burden (0.49).7,11 That study methodologically mimicked a drug study by including measures that are commonly used in dementia medication trials, which enabled comparison of the magnitude of our results to currently available dementia medications.. The investigators are now completing data collection for a second implementation of the PLIÉ program at an adult day program in San Rafael, CA (Senior Access). The intervention of the current proposal will be similar to PLIÉ in using the same principles6 and taught by instructors trained in the PLIÉ program. However, it will differ in its format: instead of a day-care center-based group program taught by professional exercise instructors, it uses a dyadic approach, introduced through caregiver support groups to pairs of individuals with dementia and their caregivers, initially using a group class format, but taught to enable caregivers to practice independently at home. To allow for wide-spread long-term routine application, it will be brief (20 minutes), use personalized music associated with positive affect memories, and be supported by video instructions.||2 papers have been published about the study.||Therefore, the investigators propose studying a paired integrative exercise intervention that can be practiced in dyads of caregivers and affected individuals at home or in a community-based support group environment, does not require additional equipment, can be easily learned by caregivers, and may ameliorate the impact of dementia for older persons and caregivers. The investigators suggest a multimodal program that is based on implicit procedural learning and the integrative principles of the PLIÉ program: it includes physical (through touch) and social interaction with a trusted family member, focuses on physical function such as balance, includes personalized music choices and singing, supports positive affect, and uses language to cognitively enhance the experience of mind-body integration. It promotes a playful, non-judgmental supportive attitude to foster a sense of embodied personhood in individuals with dementia through joyful social interaction with an empowered caregiver.||Recruitment. Study participants will be recruited from local caregiver support groups of Kaiser Permanente in Oakland. Exercise instructors and the PI have already been invited to give presentations at their regular meetings. Contacts have been established with 3 caregiver support groups meeting at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, totaling about 100 caregivers, who meet once a month and confirmed strong interest to participate. Thus, it is highly likely that we will twice be able to recruit 10 dyads of eligible participants. In addition, investigators will give study flyers to caregiver support managers at Kaiser Permanente, the local Alzheimer's Association groups, and the Alzheimer's Services of the East Bay (ASEB). In addition, we will recruit at ASEB.||Caregivers will be informed about the study by brief presentations by the PI and an exercise instructor during regular support group meetings. A flyer will be handed to interested potential participants describing the study and providing an opportunity to learn more by returning a form or calling the research study staff. Those caregivers who express interest will be contacted by research staff by phone to further assess interest/eligibility and to schedule a consent visit.||Informed consent. Verbal consent to be screened will be obtained over the telephone prior to collecting information on demographics and medical and psychiatric history. Written consent will be obtained with the affected individuals and caregivers together, as described in more detail below. The consent forms will be reviewed and capacity to consent will be assessed in primary participants based on responses to questions to determine level of understanding of study procedures, risks, benefits and rights. Participants who do not demonstrate capacity to consent will be asked to assent to study procedures and caregivers will be asked to consent on their behalf. A separate consent form will request permission to participate in video recording of exercise classes for quality control purposes. After the consent process has been completed, the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (3MS) will be administered to affected individuals to assess level of cognitive impairment. Consent procedures will take place at the Kaiser group room unless otherwise requested by caregivers.||If the caregiver is not the Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) or the legal guardian of the affected individual, the screening interview will be stopped. Investigators will then mail a letter to the LAR or legal guardian and invite her/him to contact us by mail or phone to discuss the study and the consent process. The screening and eligibility questions for the affected individual will then be completed with the LAR or legal guardian. If investigators do not get a response within 2 weeks they will call the LAR or legal guardian by phone assuming that she/he has received our letter. Only if this person permits the affected individual's study participation investigators will contact the caregiver and the affected individual again.||How will investigators assess the potential participant's capacity to consent? Capacity to consent will be assessed by research assistants (RA) who will be extensively trained by the PI and co-investigators using a standardized procedure. Investigators first provide the consent form to the patient and caregiver together and allow them to review it. RAs then describe the key points of the form, pointing to the areas on the form where the information is described in more detail. They then ask a series of yes/no questions to assess understanding of the information in the form. If the participant cannot answer the questions, RAs review the material again and point to the section on the form. Investigators then repeat the questions. If participants are unable to answer all of the questions on their own after review, RAs consider them to lack capacity to consent. RAs then ask them if they would like to participate in the study to obtain their assent. RAs say that they are going to ask the caregiver to sign the form on the participant's behalf to obtain written consent. Most of the team's research assistants have been and are psychology graduate students who are highly sensitive to working with vulnerable patients. Investigators train new research staff by having them role play the consent process until senior personnel determine that they are adequately prepared. They then observe senior personnel performing the consent process on at least one study participant. Subsequently they are observed performing the consent process until senior personnel determine that they are competent. Investigators/RAs also have weekly team meetings to discuss any difficulties that arise during consent or any other study procedure.||Randomization: Following the baseline assessments, assessing staff will open an opaque, sealed envelop for each dyad (affected individual and caregiver). Envelops will be numbered and will contain the group assignment. A statistician not involved in the study will prepare these envelops and create a random sequence of numbers using a computer program. There will be 2 piles of envelops, one for men and one for women to recruit a similar proportions of male and female participants in both groups.||1st Pilot-test Phase. Affected individual/caregiver dyads who consented will be invited to participate in the first pilot phase of 10 dyads. These subjects will participate in either Group 1 (initial intervention), which will participate first, or Group 2 (wait list control group). Group 1 will participate in the Paired PLIÉ program 2 times/week for 45 minutes for 4 weeks and then once/month for additional 3 months while Group 2 will be wait-listed. After Group 1 has completed their training, Group 2 will participate in the PLIÉ program 2 times/week for 45 minutes for 4 weeks and then once/month for additional 3 months. Group assignment will be random. Investigators will strive to have an equal distribution of men/women in the two groups.||Intervention: the exercise protocol is based on the PLIÉ protocol, which the investigators have developed in consultation with experts worldwide who have experience performing different types of exercises in individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia, including traditional strength-building exercises, yoga, Tai Chi and Feldenkrais. Specifically, investigators have identified exercises from each of these traditions that engage the muscles most needed to maintain independence--including lower body strength (to help with getting out of bed/chair), balance (to minimize risk of falls), upper body strength (to help with lifting), fine motor exercises (to help with activities such as eating and brushing teeth), and pelvic floor exercises (to help with continence)--and have combined them into a unique integrative exercise program. These exercises are designed to be purposeful (i.e., to achieve a goal) and to build procedural ('muscle') memory. In addition, breathing and guided meditation exercises are included to promote relaxation and well-being.||While the PLIÉ program has been tested in a senior day care setting, investigators are combining these exercises in a new way, that they can be practiced at home in dyads of affected individuals and caregivers.||2nd Pilot-test Phase. In a second phase investigators will repeat the identical protocol and intervention with 10 more dyads of affected individuals and caregivers.|Pre- and post-intervention assessment. Investigators will perform a variety of standard measures in all participants and caregivers. The following assessments will occur at baseline and after the 3 follow-up months. They will primarily be utilized to assess feasibility and logistics of data collection procedures. Separate appointments will be made for affected individuals and caregivers to maximize the validity of data collected (e.g., to ensure that caregivers do not 'help' affected individuals with answers to questions and feel comfortable providing information about issues such as difficult behaviors or levels of stress). Affected individuals assessments will take place at the group room. The initial caregiver assessment will take place at the caregiver's home or the group room. The first line of communication for follow-up appointments will be via telephone or in person to minimize the risk of loss of privacy. At the caregiver participant's request, further communication may be conducted via mail, email, fax or text. Caregivers will be informed that these modes of communication may increase their risk of loss of privacy. Mail, email, fax and text communications will include a confidentiality statement. The minimum amount of identifying information will be included in all communications. Study forms will include unique study ID numbers only.",Dementia
NCT03773016,"SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION:||People with dementia that live in care homes are more prone to experience a lack of stimulation and be socially isolated. Activities that are likely to be beneficial for people with dementia are social and leisure activities, as the activities promote engagement and improve affect. It has been argued that these activities should be of high importance in care settings and that care home residents living with dementia should have access to meaningful activities and are supported when engaging with the activities.||The use of touchscreen technology is one strategy that may possibly engage older people in enjoyable leisure activities. In past research, people with dementia and staff reported positive experiences with the use of technology in previous research that evaluate the impacts of touchscreen technology in care homes. This same research also showed supportive evidence for the positive contribution of the touchscreen technology for improvements in quality of life, relationships and interpersonal interactions. A literature review from 2017 on the use of touchscreen technology by people with dementia and its impact on wellbeing also shows supportive evidence for the use of touchscreen technology in dementia care. The researchers concluded that touchscreen-based interventions could provide benefits on mood, mental health, social interaction, quality of interaction, and sense of mastery. If people with dementia have the appropriate support for the use of touchscreen technology, it is evidently possible for people to benefit from its use.||A possible way to engage people with dementia with touchscreen technology could be through the use of the visual arts. Preliminary evidence shows that use of arts for people with dementia appears to be beneficial in reducing behavioural symptoms, depression and isolation and make people with dementia more able to express feelings. The use of visual art activities in touchscreen technology is a promising idea, as positive results from interventions using these activities separately can be found in scientific literature. So far, very little research on the benefits of visual art interventions on touchscreen devices has been made. Thus, there is a need to have more research on this topic. This study will add to research on this field and its results could be valuable to care staff and people with dementia. Providing people with dementia a set of exciting activities which have the potential to enrich people lives and be beneficial for wellbeing.||DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:||The intervention activity will consist of the use of two different visual art apps on touchscreen tablets with people with mild to moderate dementia that lives in care homes. The study will take place in a nursing home in Nottinghamshire. It will involve 12 residents of the care home with dementia and staff members that are involved in participants' care. Potential participants will be identified by the care home staff, and staff members will indicate these people to the research team. Study data collection will take 8 weeks; four weeks will involve the execution of the intervention and four weeks for additional measurements (collect consent, screening and end measures). Given the nature of the intervention, no practical control condition would be a reasonable comparison for this intervention. Thus, the use of a cross-over design is a suitable control condition to be used in this study. Participants will be split into two groups of 6 participants; each group will use one app for two weeks and then change to the other app for another 2 weeks. Participants will be supported to use the app twice a week, with a maximum of 8 individual sessions over the four weeks. The data collection will consist of the observation of the activity and on the use of dementia-specific instruments and questionnaires.||This research aims to explore the supported use of two digital art apps in a participatory artistic activity with people living with dementia in residential care. The research team is interested in checking the efficacy of the activity. The team will also evaluate if art activities on touchscreen tablets are accepted by participants and carers and if the intervention is feasible in care settings.||The following research questions were formulated for this study:||What effects do participatory digital art on touchscreen tablets have on people with dementia in care homes? (impact on participants - efficacy)||How the insertion of the digital art activity is perceived by people with dementia and the care staff (acceptability of the intervention)||How can digital art apps be implemented in care homes to be delivered by the staff? (practicality of the intervention).||STUDY PROCESS AND TIMETABLE:||• Week 1 to Week 3:||These weeks will focus on:||Visits to explain the study to participants and consultees (30 minutes). Collection of the consent of the participants and consultees and answer questions (20 minutes).||Once the informed consent is signed potential participants with dementia will be accessed for cognition with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment - MoCA to ensure that the potential participants fit the inclusion criteria and will give the investigators a baseline on participants' cognition before the intervention (10 minutes).||Once the participants are selected, staff members will be contacted to reply to questions and questionnaires about the participant with dementia. Staff members will be asked to provide demographic information about the participants (3 minutes for each participant with dementia), to answer questions about the care home life (5 minutes), and to answer a proxy-instrument, the QUALIDEM for each of the participants (5 minutes for each participant with dementia).||Week 4 to Week 7:||The intervention activities with the participants with dementia will take place during these four weeks. The intervention will be delivered to the participants with dementia at a quiet room in the care home by two co-investigators, one will be the facilitator, and the other one will be the observer. All the sessions will be video recorded and analysed by two independent co-investigators. The use of video was preferred to observation and note taken as with it is possible to analyse the interaction between the participant and facilitator with the touchscreen tablet at the same time. With the analysis of the intervention through videos is also possible to focus on details that could be missed with observations, as videos give the opportunity to pause and repeat key points of the interaction for a comprehensive analysis.||The intervention is a 30-minutes of individual sessions, with 10 minutes of app use. The additional 20 minutes will include the setup of the equipment and preparation of the participant at the beginning of the session; and questions for the participants at the end. The sessions will happen in the afternoon four days a week (on weekdays), with 6 participants per day (one of the groups). Each group will have fixed session days, to make the staff aware of which participants would have a session on a specific day.||Data collection here will be made through:||Participants' observation: Participants' behaviour in the video records of the sessions will be analysed with an adapted version of the Greater Cincinnati Chapter Wellbeing Observation Tool.||Questions to participants: At the end of each session, the participants will be asked to answer questions on visual analogue scales (VAS) to evaluate participants subjective wellbeing at that moment (3 minutes).||Questionnaires and questions to staff: Staff members will be asked to answer the QUALIDEM once a week during the 4-week intervention for each of the participants (5 minutes for each participant with dementia).||The research team will also evaluate the acceptability and practicality of the intervention:||Acceptability: Participants will be asked at the end of the sessions (once a week) questions about satisfaction with the apps and the intervention (3 minutes) relevance of the activity, and if would be interest in continue the use of the apps (VAS, and open questions). The research team will also check for actual use of the touchscreen tablet between the sessions and will provide a form to the care staff keep a record (1 minute for each entry).||Practicality: To evaluate the practicality of the intervention, the participants and the staff will be asked on the opinion on frequency and duration of the intervention (ideal and what was received) (3 minutes). During the intervention the researchers will make observations on care home daily life and will collect information on the type and amount of resources needed, training required and time to support the intervention. There also will be an analysis of the barriers and facilitators for the implementation of the activity in care homes. One of the researchers will collect this information through field notes of observation of the sessions and discussions with the care staff.||Week 8:||For end measurements, the MoCA (10 minutes) will be used with participants with dementia and the staff members will be asked to answer the QUALIDEM for each of the participants (5 minutes for each participant with dementia).||• At a later point (data collection finished): Once data collection is complete, the research team will develop the guidance on the use of touchscreen tablets in residential care for people with dementia. Staff members from the care home will be asked to give feedback on the guidance through informal consultation. This informal consultation could happen through email communication or in-person meetings. This should happen within 2 months after the end of data collection. The analysis and writing up findings should take up to 5 months.",Dementia
NCT03132272,"The IMAD trial outlined aims to ascertain whether the positive effects of immunoadsorption (IA) on slowing down dementia progression, shown in a pilot trial, can be replicated in a slightly larger number of subjects and to comprehensively investigate the effects by a combination of brain and vessel imaging along with cognitive tests and further state-of-the-art cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and laboratory examinations. If the trial results underpin the hypothesis that IA effectively counteracts pathophysiological impairments and dementia-related cognitive decline, it may open up a new treatment approach against dementia, namely the reversal or avoidance of further vascular damage by the removal of agonistic autoantibodies (agAAB) in agAAB-positive persons.||The aim of this study is (beside of safety) to demonstrate the stop of the vascular remodeling and cognition decline by immunoadsorption, a therapeutic method which is well established in cardiology and nephrology.",Dementia
NCT03011723,"Dementia is often followed by complicating symptoms such as anxiety, depression, agitation, hallucination and sleep disorders. The progression of dementia can threaten the relationship between the person with dementia (PWD) and their relatives.

NCT01475578,"This phase II clinical trial was planned to be in double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel, comparative, multicenter design. Two hundred and 40 eligible subjects were planned to be recruited by 5 study centers. The treatment period planned in the protocol was 3 months with 5 study visits including Randomization visit (Day 0), three post-treatment visits (1 and 2 months after Randomization visit and Final visit) and 1 follow-up visit made at 6 month after Randomization visit.||After subjects recruited by this study having read and singed the ICF, they were arranged to be collected information of demographics, medical history, allergy history, medication history, and concomitant medication. Laboratory and physical examination including vital signs were performed, and Hachinski Ischemia Score (HIS), Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and Classification of Marrow-Sea deficiency were evaluated to ensure subject's eligibility to enter this study. After the subjects were confirmed eligible, they were randomly assigned to either STA-1 or Ergoloid Mesylates group.

NCT02919748,"Cognitive function declines with advancing age and the prevalence and incidence of dementia rises dramatically in later life. Impaired cognitive function limits one's ability to work, live and socialize, and represent a major obstacle for active aging. Data from Asian countries showed a clear role of cognitive function in contributing to functional disability independent of physical health. How to maintain good cognitive health in the later stage of life is an important and challenging question that requires well-founded research with good applicability. With no cure for dementia in sight presently, it is vitally important to find effective preventive measures. Candidates and potential avenues for intervention should be carefully evaluated in well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCT). Here the investigators propose choral singing as a novel approach for the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia; the investigators plan to test the hypothesized efficacy in a RCT based on a selected group of senior Singaporeans from the Jurong Area. This proposed research is built on a growing body of research evidence on the role of choral singing in health promotion and psychological wellbeing; and the fact that no trial has tested the potential effectiveness of choral singing in delaying cognitive decline and the onset of dementia.||The plasticity of the brain forms the scientific basis for the potential efficacy of choral singing in preventing cognitive decline and the incidence of dementia. It is well known that participating in various cognitive, social and productive activities is associated with improved cognitive function and lower risk of dementia. The protective effects on cognition may be particularly effective for certain subgroups. For example, analysis of local data showed that among the single and widowed elderly, an increase in social engagement was associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment: compared with subjects in the lowest tertile of social engagement scores, the adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) of cognitive impairment was 0.50 for subjects in the second or the third tertile.||Data from previous clinical trials support that cognitive training is effective in improving cognitive function or delaying cognitive decline in the elderly. Functional gains from cognitive training have been reported to last up to five years, with a meta-analysis demonstrating that the protective effects of cognitive training on cognition in healthy elderly can persist years after training. In Singapore, a brain-computer interface based cognitive training system showed promise in improving memory and attention in healthy elderly. Specifically, the training led to significant improvement in immediate memory (p = 0.038), visuospatial/constructional (p = 0.014), attention (p = 0.039), and delayed memory (p<0.001) scores. However, cognitive training based on human trainer or brain-computer interface are expensive and hence the applicability as a preventive in real world setting for the general population is largely limited. Participants of such trainings also may not be able to maintain lasting interest and motivation. Given those considerations, relatively cost-effective and captivating methods are urgently needed and we believe choral singing is a promising candidate.||In Singapore, there are more than 200 school choirs. Most universities and tertiary education institutions have choirs developed as an expressive art form. Furthermore, there are numerous church choirs who sing with spiritual passion, and the professional choruses who are selected to sing and to perform. The existing resource can be tapped on in the future for large scale interventional initiative once solid data of its efficacy are produced from rigorously designed clinical studies.||In this collaborative research project that involves experts from multiple disciplines, the investigators propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial to examine the clinical efficacy of choral singing in the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia. As a cognitive stimulating activity, choral singing involves cognitive processes such as attention, memory, executive function and language. As a social activity, choral singing consists of group interactions which cultivate the feeling of being part of a meaningful community. Prior studies have demonstrated that situations and activities involving synchrony with others induces feelings of closeness and affiliation, and bolsters coordination with synchronization partners. Increased prosociality and conformity produced by synchrony may also be applied to other people more generally, even those who were not synchronization partners. Moreover, synchrony and affiliative orientations also share a bi-directional relationship, such that individuals who are more prone to prosocial tendencies are more likely to synchronize with others. As a physical exercise, choral singing requires the involvement of more than 100 muscles; it helps to improve lung function and circulation, promotes superior posture, and boost balance and resistance. Choral singing also requires the choristers to cooperate with each other, the discipline of listening to blend with fellow singers and need persistently hard work to stay on par with the level of other singers. All the above may contribute to long term cognitive benefits of choral singing.||Although theoretically plausible, the effectiveness of choral singing in preventing cognitive decline and dementia has not been studied scientifically. This proposed study will fill an important knowledge gap. The investigators aim to produce firm data on two year efficacy of choral singing in preventing cognitive decline and this will form the evidence base for further research and future interventional initiative.",Dementia

NCT03923517,"RHAPSODY-plus is a joint project of the Technische Universität München, Zentrum für kognitive Störungen and the Melbourne University. The project consists of two parts. In a first step carers of people with young onset dementia (YOD; onset before the age of 65) have the opportunity to use the RHAPSODY online program (Kurz et al., 2016) for four weeks. This e-learning program focuses on managing problem behaviors, dealing with role change, obtaining support, and looking after oneself. In a second step the participants will receive two individual counseling sessions via MEET (online videoconferencing). In a first session carers can talk with a social worker about individual problems concerning social, financial and legal issues. In a second session with a psychologist personal and emotional problems can be addressed. These two sessions are about 60 minutes. The study investigates whether these counseling sessions have an additional benefit. The primary aim is to determine whether the intervention is considered acceptable and useful by the participants. Secondary aim is to investigate whether the intervention is feasible. The sample size will be determined when data saturation is reached (no new themes emerge from the qualitative data at the final feedback session). From previous experiences with pilot studies using qualitative methods we expect this to be achieved with approximately 20 participants. This number of participants should also ensure that a diverse group of carers is participating in this pilot study (both genders; different age groups, types of relatives; diagnoses (both FTD and AD) for care recipients; environments (city versus rural); socioeconomic status; and carer stressors (carers with children, carers who hold a job, carers with different stressors, etc.).",Dementia

NCT03615027,"Study background and aims:||Advance care planning (ACP) is a structured communication process between an individual, his family, and his healthcare agent (if existing), facilitated by a healthcare provider. The aim is to identify the personal values of the individual, reflect on the meanings and consequences of anticipated illness scenarios, define goals and preferences of care for these situations, issue appropriate documents and legal instruments that will help direct future healthcare decisions, and review these steps at adequate intervals. ACP emphasizes communication in anticipation of a future deterioration of a person's health.

NCT03108781,"Dementia as one of the most debilitating diseases presents with decline in memory and cognitive functions causing reduction in the intellectual abilities and every day functions. Today, there are estimated 24 million people suffering from dementia world wide and those numbers are expected to double every 20 years (Qiu, De Ronchi, & Fratiglioni, 2007).||About 80% of all patients suffering from dementia will develop at some point behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD)(Aalten et al., 2003). These symptoms will develop in at least 50% of patients treated in outpatient setting and in 75% of patients in nursing homes (Zaudig, 2000).||The behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) syndrome may lead to high degree of distress in the patient and close-once, causing burnout of the primary care giver and transfer of the patient to a nursing home.||These days, the primary treatment is based on antipsychotic pharmacotherapy that is often associated with side affects and far from assured efficiency and safety (Fung, Tsang, & Chung, 2012). Research showed that the usage of antipsychotic drugs increases the chance of stroke and premature death and thus, the food and drugs administration (FDA) recommends to avoid the usage of these drugs in treatment of dementia (Ballard et al., 2009).||Non-pharmacological approach represents a good alternative in treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD). During the last decade the usage of alternative medicine is increasing (Fung et al., 2012), including the usage of aromatherapy in order to reduce anxiety and restlessness in dementia patients (Hersh & Falzgraf, 2007).||The treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) with aromatherapy is being used for years in order to improve sleep and reduce behavioural abnormalities. However, the amount of research that studies the efficacy of aromatherapy in dementia patients is limited (Fung et al., 2012). There is lack of conclusive evidence and knowledge in the effects of dementia treatment using aromatherapy. There are two possible explanations for the conflicting and inconclusive results of studies in this area:||Period of treatment was too short (few minutes a day for only a week).|The treatment was applied far from the olfactory system (e.g., legs)||In order to confront these issues, the investigators are planning a study that will take place over the course of 4 month and will compare the treatment of aromatherapy close to the olfactory systems (i.e., face) and distant from it (i.e., legs).",Dementia
NCT03430401,"This study extends on the positive results of a pilot study (Lim et al., 2012) which demonstrated the effectiveness of a cognitive training program combined with perceptual and semantic memory encoding strategies. Following the intervention phase of the pilot study, elements of cognition were examined using standardised assessments. The participants showed improved general attention (p = 0.03), memory (p = 0.03) and cognitive function including naming (p = 0.02), construction (p = 0.01), memory (p = 0.02) and similarities (p = 0.001) all of which are necessary for functioning in daily activities. However, due to the combination of strategies used during the pilot study, the isolated effect of perceptual and semantic memory encoding strategies could not be determined. It has been found that the effects of aging impact negatively on both semantic and perceptual encoding. However, with age, there tends to be a greater impact on an individual's ability to use perceptual encoding strategies in comparison to those of semantic (Kuo, Liu, Ting, & Chan, 2014). This varies in the case of individuals in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease in which many individuals will show progressive impairment in semantic memory (Hodges & Patterson, 1995). As dementia has been positively correlated with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) but not often diagnosed until much later in the course of the disease and as not all individuals with MCI will progress to dementia it would be beneficial prior to undertaking a memory encoding intervention program to understand if an individual would benefit greater from undertaking a semantic or a perceptual memory encoding rehabilitation approach. Although it may be easy for a healthy adult to report their preference in encoding style, an individual with MCI or mild dementia may find this more difficult due to the abstract complexity of the concepts. As it is known that not all cases of MCI progress to dementia, this study aims at identifying if individuals with MCI or mild dementia will benefit from intervention based on both semantic and perceptual encoding styles.||In addition, given the benefit and successful use of computer-based programs in elderly, this study will develop the memory encoding training program into a user-friendly computer-based program in which the older adults with MCI or mild dementia will be able to use under the guidance of rehabilitation professionals.",Dementia

NCT02804789,"The EPAD project has been established to overcome the major hurdles hampering drug development for secondary prevention of AD dementia, by conducting the EPAD LCS (fed mainly from existing Parent Cohorts (PC) across Europe) in alignment with the adaptive design EPAD PoC trial. Both EPAD LCS and EPAD PoC trial will be run in an exclusive network of highly selected, expert Trial Delivery Centres (TDC) that will be selected on the basis of strictly applied criteria to ensure the highest possible data quality, successful recruitment and adherence to the EPAD principles.||While interventions must start early in the course of AD, accurate disease models covering the entire course of AD before dementia onset are lacking. Estimating with reasonable confidence an individual's overall probability of developing AD dementia over a defined time period must take into account multiple dimensions simultaneously (e.g. cognition, biomarkers, traditional risk factors - genetic and environmental). This will allow any given individual to be placed somewhere on a probability spectrum from negligible probability to high probability. Because individuals with similar overall probability may have very different contributions from various components in each dimension, flexible algorithms are needed instead of simple cut-offs to identify a probability-spectrum population adequate for both disease modelling and for providing a sufficient number of potential trial participants (especially in adaptive trials with multiple arms testing drugs with different mechanisms of action).||EPAD LCS is designed to address the dual need for development of accurate longitudinal models for AD covering the entire disease course, and development of adequate infrastructure for facilitating identification of research participants and clinical trial recruitment. EPAD LCS will have a probability-spectrum population selected mostly from already existing PCs across Europe to facilitate fast recruitment. Different types of PCs will be considered (e.g. memory clinic-based, population-based). Due to the variety of PCs, some EPAD LCS research participants will be e.g. memory clinic patients without dementia, while others will be e.g. participants without dementia from the general population. The variety of PC settings will ensure that the EPAD LCS probability-spectrum population can cover the entire continuum of probability for AD dementia development. Regular EPAD LCS follow-up with clinical, cognitive and biomarker assessments will provide a well-phenotyped probability-spectrum population, generating high-quality data for updating disease models, for easier identification of individuals suitable for trial inclusion, and for use as trial run-in data and reference for evaluating intervention efficacy.||The flow of research participants from the population at large to the trial is divided into the following stages: firstly, EPAD will engage existing PCs from across Europe who may have eligible research participants for the EPAD LCS. The next step is drawing research participants from the PCs into the EPAD LCS to maintain a suitable population of approximately 6,000 research participants. Recruitment will be complemented with research participants who are recruited from a clinical setting by their referring clinician. To enable access to the EPAD LCS for these potential participants, the referring clinician will check if they match the flexible algorithm. Finally, research participants in the EPAD LCS who fulfil trial inclusion criteria (approximately 1,500 research participants), will be invited to enter the EPAD PoC (PoC) trial for evaluation of treatment for secondary prevention of AD dementia. This trial is a standing, adaptive, PoC trial that could involve multiple arms running concurrently.

NCT01825577,"This is an open label pilot study; consenting subjects with dementia and identified as a fall risk, who meet inclusion criteria will undergo 3 phases of involvement. Phase 1 is a 1 week period before initiating study drug. Phase 2 is a 2 week treatment period with 10mg of Transdermal Methylphenidate. Phase 3 is the final two week treatment period with 15mg of Transdermal Methylphenidate.||Measurements obtained at each phase will include:||Vital Signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) weight , Timed Get Up and Go Test (TUG) , Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA), Clinical Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C) and the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS).||The primary endpoint is the change in TUG and POMA scores at end of phase 3 compared to beginning of phase 2||Falls are a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality in patients with dementia and occur at twice the rate of older adults without cognitive impairment. The consequences of falls in older adults with dementia are serious; fallers with cognitive problems are approximately five times as likely to be admitted to institutional care as people with cognitive problems who do not fall.[3] They are also at high risk of major fall-related injuries such as fractures and head injuries that increase mortality risk.||Walking requires paying attention to various environmental features and recovering from postural variations to avoid stumbles or falls. Consequently, deficits in attention and executive function are independently associated with risk of postural instability, impairment in activities of daily living, and fall risk.||Executive function refers to higher cognitive processes that allocate attention among tasks and a critical cognitive resource for normal walking. Lower scores on executive function measures are associated with both dementia and a higher fall risk. Although significant progress towards understanding the factors involved in falls has been made, the number of falls and fall related injuries continue to increase.||Changes in aging demographics are expected to dramatically increase the aging population and dementia prevalence, underscoring the importance of developing more effective fall prevention strategies.||Recent studies have shown that improving certain aspects of cognition, specifically attention and executive function, in older adults can improve mobility decline and risk of falls. Particularly in cognitively impaired individuals, this may be critical to reducing fall risk.||Why Methylphenidate?||Pharmacological properties of psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate (MPH), are known to increase executive function. Methylphenidate was chosen because of the studies demonstrating the safe use of MPH for treatment of depression and apathy in the cognitively impaired elderly and the well-studied effects of MPH on executive function and attention in children and adults with ADHD.||Also a small study published in April 2008 in J Am Geriatric Society, evaluated the use of methylphenidate in reducing fall risk among community living older adults. The study concluded that among study subjects receiving methylphenidate, significant improvement in mobility and gait assessments were observed as well as drug tolerability.||The basis for our study is to further explore the pharmacotherapeutic role of Transdermal-MPH in reducing fall risk in dementia patients.||Mobility and gait assessment performance is strongly correlated with fall risk. Therefore we will use subject's scores before, during and after medication administration to measure response and evaluate use as a fall prevention strategy.",Dementia

NCT01744600,"While music therapy has been noted to be an effective intervention in decreasing agitation and disruptive behaviour in adults with dementia (Livingston et al, 2005), these effects have only been demonstrated during and immediately after sessions, arguably due to the progressive nature of dementia. To achieve long-lasting therapeutic change, it seems necessary to consider the specific elements that work in music therapy, and extract them for use within other activities. It is hypothesised that the use of such elements within additional activities and care provision, alongside regular music therapy sessions, may result in decreasing residents' BPSD for a longer duration of time.||Little research has been carried out that specifically identifies the key elements of music therapy which contribute to its efficacy within the field of dementia. This study aims to support existing evidence highlighting the significance of using music therapy within dementia care, and, importantly, identify what elements are principally involved in producing changes in behaviour and levels of well-being. The study will also incorporate the collection of dementia residents' physiological data, specifically their Electrodermal Activity (EDA), during therapy sessions. This will be measured by recording participants' levels of skin conductance (microSiemens/cm); this is controlled by the Sympathetic Nervous System and roughly thought of as the Fight or Flight system. Many efforts have been made to explore how skin conductance indicates the levels of emotional arousal, for example, high skin conductance indicates excitement or stress; low skin conductance indicates sadness or calmness. (Poh et. al., 2010; 2012; Van Dooren et. al., 2012). The skin conductance data is proposed to help identify the key elements and observable phenomena of the videoed music therapy sessions showing reduced presentation of BPSD.||If the current study is able to identify such elements, these findings will enable future research to investigate more comprehensively how these can be transplanted into other activities to optimise their effects.||Participants will be recruited from two residential Methodist Homes, and using a cluster randomized control design, will be allocated to either the control group on intervention group. Participants in the control group will receive standard daily care for 22 weeks. Participants in the intervention group will, in addition to daily standard care, receive one session of individualised active music therapy once a week for a period of 22 weeks.||Music therapy sessions will last 30 minutes. During the session the participant will wear a 'Q-sensor' device around their wrist, which will record their skin conductance levels. Each session will be video-recorded.||A communication system will be employed after each therapy session, in which video clips of the session demonstrating the participant engaging in an interaction or expression will be presented to care staff. This process will aim to demonstrate to staff how Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are minimised by music therapy techniques, the possible causes of BPSD, and how the therapist has made use of the participants' remaining abilities to enhance and facilitate their involvement and interpersonal communication within sessions.||The primary outcome measure will be the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, a standardised questionnaire used to assess the psychopathology of dementia patients. This will be carried out with residents' keyworkers at the following time points: as a baseline measure in the 2 weeks prior to the commencement of the music therapy intervention period, then at weeks 11-12, weeks 21-22 and as a follow-up at weeks 27-28. There will be three secondary outcome measures:||dementia care mapping, an observational tool used to assess the quality of care delivered by staff.

NCT00450047,"Dementia is a syndrome caused by diseases of the cerebral parenchyma, and it is a state in which cognitive functions, including attention, memory, thinking, comprehension, judgment, and computation, are diminished. Because of the mental symptoms, problem behaviors, and decreased activities of daily living (ADL) it is also recognized as a major social problem. However, rehabilitation of elderly people with dementia is still at the trial-and-error stage, and establishing a method of rehabilitation is an urgent task. In 2004, the authors devised and created a training method that integrates exercise therapy with feedback therapy to treat the cognitive dysfunction of elderly people with dementia. To do so the authors introduced speed-feedback therapy with a bicycle ergometer as a feedback therapy intervention. The results of a preliminary study of the efficacy of this method in improving cognitive dysfunction in 17 elderly persons with dementia showed improvement in cognitive dysfunction, and their attentiveness also improved, suggesting that the impaired attentiveness may have improved in response to treatment by this method and, as a result, have led to improvement of cognitive dysfunction. However, it became clear that it would be necessary to further improve and develop the system, and to demonstrate its efficacy in a controlled trial and verify associations between improvement of cognitive dysfunction and improvement of the ADL of dementia patients and their quality of life (QOL).",Dementia

NCT00147693,"A major challenge for future health care is the care for dementia patients and their informal caregivers. In usual care, the problems of caregivers often remain invisible until a crisis occurs. This inhibition is partly the result of informal caregivers paying scant attention to their own problems. Another reason is that professionals may not know how to support informal caregivers pro-actively (Van Hout et al., 2000). Therefore the family support programme (Bengtson, 1985: Vernooij et al., 2000) has been transformed into a Systematic Care Programme (SCP-Dementia). The reasons for choosing and studying the efficiency of this programme are the potential to diagnose and treat problems systematically, to cover a wide range of individual problems, its flexibility in connecting interventions to these problems, its suitability for pro-activity and the positive effects of the programme found in our previous study (Vernooij et al., 2000). To study its efficiency a cluster randomised controlled trial design will be used. Randomisation will take place in each of three participating regions. Professionals in the ambulatory mental health care services (psychologists and social psychiatric nurses) will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group before the recruitment of patients and informal caregivers. The study population consists of pairs of patients and their informal caregivers visiting the ambulatory mental health care service for the first time. The intervention is the training in SCP-Dementia and its subsequent use. SCP-Dementia consists of an assessment of the caregiver's sense of competence and suggestions on how to deal with deficiencies in competence. The follow-up period is one year. The primary outcome is patients´ admissions to nursing homes or residential homes. The secondary outcome is quality of life. Caregivers´ quality of life is assessed by sense of competence (SCQ), depression (CES-D) and physical quality of life (EuroQol). Patients´ quality of life by behavioral problems is assessed by the NPI-Q and the QOL-AD-Scale. The difference in proposed effect was based on previous research in which 14% of the patients in the intervention group and 28% in the control group were institutionalized (Vernooij-Dassen, 1993;1995). To detect a 50% reduction in institutionalization rates with 80% power at the two sided significance level of 0.05, 132 patient-caregiver dyads would be needed for each of the intervention and control arm. We inflated this sample size by a design effect of 1.15 to 152 dyads per trial arm to allow for correlation of dyads within the same cluster (i.e. professional), assuming an average cluster size of four and an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.05. Assuming a 25% dropout rate of patient-caregiver dyads, the study needed an final enrolment of 190 dyads in each trial arm.

As this problem has been identified and described by the Advisory Council on the Assessment of Developments in the Health Care System (Sachverständigenrat zur Begutachtung der Entwicklung im Gesundheitswesen) already in 20121, different approaches have been proposed. This study addresses the lack of integrated cross-sectoral approaches to overcome the challenges caused by the sectorized German health care system.There is sound scientific evidence internationally and nationally that collaborative concepts of care can improve treatment and care of people with dementia in primary care (Thyrian et al. 2017). Those concepts are person-centered in the sense of a) taking into account the individual needs, circumstances and priorities, and b) aiming at outcomes relevant to the individuals life, like everyday functionality, (health related) quality of life and social inclusion.||The trial is a complex, longitudinal, multisite randomized controlled trial (intervention vs. care as usual). Recruitment of the study population will be conducted in two participating hospitals. After meeting the eligibility criteria, participants will be asked for written informed consent. With all participants a basic baseline assessment will be conducted (T0) in the hospital. After that they will be randomized in either the intervention group or control group. The intervention group will then receive the intervention, the control group care as usual. Further data assessments will be conducted at all participants´ home 3 months after discharge (T1) and at the participants´ home 12 months after discharge (T2). A process evaluation will also be applied in this study. Data assessment will be conducted by specifically trained study staff. Places of assessment are chosen for the highest possible convenience for the participants. Data assessments will include a) primary data from the participants being assessed, computer-assisted, face-to face and paper-pencil, b) secondary data from patient records in the hospital and from treating physicians.||The main research question of this protocol addresses the effectiveness of Dementia Care Management (DCM) in the intersectoral setting for people with cognitive impairment (PCI) in treatment and care across the in-hospital and primary care sector. The investigators will test the hypothesis if PCI receiving DCM initiated in hospitals and continued after discharge into ambulatory care do have better health and social outcomes after one year than PCI not receiving DCM. The patient-oriented minor hypotheses of this protocol are: ICM improves (a) health related quality of life sustainable, (b) social functioning and integration and (c) adequate treatment and care for dementia and co-morbidities in the ambulatory setting. It reduces (d) the risk for drug related problems in cognitive impairment and comorbidities and (e) the risk for re-admission to the hospital. The intervention prevents (f) incident delirium - given better awareness in respect to precipitating factors. The healthcare provider-oriented minor hypotheses are: ICM (a) reduces re-admission rates and thus saves costs in the inpatient setting. It increases (b) the chances to delay institutionalization significantly and thus saves costs from perspective of statutory health insurance. It (c) improves communication and exchange between treatment and care provider from different health care sectors sustainable. Furthermore, this protocol evaluates the process of implementing ICM along the main research question: How is ICM evaluated and rated among the different groups affected by it? Specific research questions are: What are the perceived benefits for (a) the providers (in the inpatient setting, (b) providers in the ambulatory setting, (c) the PCI and their caregiver? Is ICM evaluated as (d) improving communication and exchange between treatment and care provider from different health care sectors sustainable? And last not least, (e) what are the enablers and barriers to implement ICM in routine care?",Dementia

NCT04157244,"Sleep disruption in older adults living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is very debilitating and contributes to increased institutionalization, reduced cognitive function, and accelerated disease progression. Furthermore, sleep disruption is linked to poor health outcomes in caregivers (CGs), such as poor quality of life and increased CG burden. Given the potential harmful side effects of pharmacologic treatment, non-pharmacologic approaches, such as music, may provide a safer alternative to reducing sleep disruption in this vulnerable population. Listening to music has been shown to decrease agitation, anxiety and depression in nursing home residents with ADRD. A growing body of literature suggests that individualized music may improve sleep quality in older adults with early memory loss, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated in older adults with ADRD in the community, where most older adults with ADRD live. If proven feasible and acceptable, tailored music interventions can then be tested for efficacy in reducing sleep disruption.||Music selections will be individualized to older adults with ADRD and account for known sleep-inducing properties. Feasibility of processes that are key to the success of the subsequent study will be examined.

NCT02368132,"Background: Existing interventions for informal caregivers (CGs) of care recipients (CRs) with dementia vary on multiple dimensions (e.g., content, administration time, mode of delivery), and findings indicate that these programs are effective in improving CG and CR outcomes. The investigators' team has developed and evaluated two CG programs that are unique in that they are relatively brief (i.e., 3 months) and rely solely on telephone administration. The original program, the Telehealth Education Program (TEP), provides CG support, psychoeducation, and skills training in a group format. The second program adapted the original TEP to be delivered to individual CGs and includes collaborative care management services. Key components of this CR/CG-centered program include direct collaboration among teams of care managers, primary care providers (PCPs), and CGs. The decision to develop an individually-tailored, collaborative care program was partly in response to the success of collaborative care models with other patient populations and the fact that the majority of individuals with dementia receive their healthcare from their PCPs. Nonetheless, an individually-delivered program lacks the benefits derived from the mutual peer support and feedback provided by group-based interventions. What remains to be determined, therefore, is whether modifying the individually-delivered care management program to deliver TEP in a group format is more effective than the individually-delivered program alone.||Objectives: The objectives of the project include: a) testing the comparative effectiveness of 2 delivery models (individual TEP + individual care management vs. group TEP + individual care management) of a telephone-based, collaborative dementia care intervention for CGs, and b) exploring whether the individual or individual + group intervention is more effective/acceptable among spousal vs. adult children CGs.||Methods: To meet these objectives, the investigators will use a prospective, randomized control group, repeated measures (i.e., baseline, 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up) design. Participants will include 405 CGs (spouses and children 18 years of age and older) of Veterans diagnosed with dementia and receiving routine clinical care at two VA sites. CGs will be recruited for participation if they live with and/or provide 4+ hours of care/day. CGs will be randomly assigned to usual care, the individual intervention, or the individual + group intervention. The main objectives of both interventions are to facilitate resource connection and provide education, psychosocial support, and care management for individuals caring for Veterans with dementia, thereby improving access to and use of non-institutional services, rates of guideline adherent care, and CG/CR outcomes. In both interventions, CGs will receive education, continuous support, skills training, and monitoring of Veterans' medication adherence, symptoms, and service needs. CGs will be asked to complete an assessment battery of standardized measures of CR- and CG-characteristics. Veterans' clinical medical records (including cost data) also will be evaluated for screening and clinical data collection purposes.

NCT04575909,"The phrase, ""it's not what you say, but how you say it"" neatly sums up prosody - the changes to one's tone of voice that transmit meaning. Changes to speech rate, rhythm, volume, and pitch to convey emotion fall into the category of affective, or emotional, prosody. That is, the changes made to the voice to express feelings, such as happy or sad.||Following damage to the right side of the brain, such as in stroke and in some types of dementia, difficulties in affective prosody understanding and use have been observed. These findings have led researchers to view the right hemisphere as playing a critical role for emotional prosody. Affective prosody difficulties do not always spontaneously improve after acute right hemisphere stroke, and only a few evidenced-based treatments are available for these individuals as well as individuals living with dementia. It is also understood that affective prosody difficulties can negatively impact social interactions and relationships, including those who care for individuals with emotional prosody difficulties. With miscommunication frequently occurring between those living with affective prosody disorders and those with whom these people interact, the risk of reduced quality of life and social isolation is possible and could be related to poorer health outcomes. Not only might there be personal burdens associated with poor management of communication difficulties in right hemisphere stroke and dementia, but there might also be economic burdens as well. In addition to counseling caregivers, family, and friends about the communication changes of loved ones, more evidenced-based speech and language treatment options are needed for those living with affective prosody disorders.||The current study aims to investigate a new treatment for individuals with emotional prosody impairments due to right hemisphere stroke or dementia. After informed consent is received, multiple screening assessments will be completed to determine if the study is a good fit for the participant. If the participant qualifies for the study, additional assessments will be completed to gather baseline cognitive-linguistic performance. Pre-treatment assessments will occur for about 1-2 weeks (Visits 1-4). Emotional prosody treatment will occur for 4 weeks (Visits 5-16) and will focus on production (2 weeks) and recognition (2 weeks) of emotional prosody. Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment order (production-recognition, recognition-production), and all participants will complete all components of the treatment. After completion of treatment, participants will be asked to come in for follow-up visits one week (Visit 17) and one month (Visit 18) after completion of treatment to assess changes in cognitive-linguistic performance. Emotional prosody recognition and production will also be tracked during treatment. Participation in all study-related activities lasts about 2.5 months (10 weeks).",Dementia

NCT03584568,"The proposed study aims to address a major research gap in caregiving interventions in the context of intergeneration perspective-taking reappraisals. Adult child caregivers are part of a sandwich generation, involved in actualizing their own goals and coping with social expectations to care for their elderly parents. Dementia caregiving presents a particular challenge in life transition wherein the adult child is parenting his or her parents. With global aging, people living with dementia are rising exponentially. This presents a challenge for sustainable care in Hong Kong and also in countries where public services are developing and the demand for family and intergeneration caregiving is high due to collectivistic concerns. It is hypothesized that reappraising intergeneration relationships through perspective-taking will enhance the well-being of adult-child caregivers. Incorporating both psychological and social perspectives, the study makes a unique contribution to address research gaps by evaluating an integrated model of intervention for dementia caregivers.

NCT03803592,"Background:||Dementia becomes a major issue of worldwide concern. According to the World Alzheimer Report, the number of patients with dementia (PWD) worldwide was estimated at 46.8 million and it will be triply projected to 131.5 million in 2050. Similarly, dementia is also a prominent problem in Hong Kong. One in every three local seniors who are over 895 years of age suffered from dementia. The prevalence of PWD in Hong Kong will have a triple increase from 100,000 cases in 2009 to 300,000 cases in 2039.As the disease progresses, PWD will gradually lose their self-care ability and their cognitive function. In addition, behavioral symptoms such as agitation, delusion, and anxiety will appear on the sufferers. The caring burden and the uncertainty about the disease progress result in high levels of caring stress and negative emotion on family caregivers.||Nowadays, different psychosocial interventions have been designed for the PWD and their family caregivers to promote their psychological well-being. The dyadic intervention is deemed as one of the effective approach due to its mutual influence between the PWD and their family caregivers. A systematic review with 40 clinical trials found that dyadic approach can be integrated into different interventions such as psycho-education, and caring skills training . Although cognitive stimulation and multisensory stimulation therapy are regarded as an effective intervention for the cognition and the behavioral symptoms of the PWD, it is not commonly found as an element in the previous dyadic interventions. Involving family caregivers in a cognitive training can have some potential benefits for both caregivers and the PWD (e.g. cognitive function of the PWD and the quality of life) . The involvement of the family caregivers in the cognitive and multisensory stimulation therapy could promote the interactions between the PWD and caregivers which may produce additional benefits for both caregivers and the PWD, compared with the traditional cognitive stimulation therapy.||Objective:||The study aims to explore the feasibility and effects of the home based dyadic Multisensory and cognitive stimulation (MCS) intervention for the PWD and their family caregivers. From this, the following research objectives were derived:||To explore the recruitment rate the and adherence rate of home based dyadic MCS program|To explore the feasibility in delivering the home based MCS program by the family caregivers|To explore the preliminary effects of dyadic MCS program for family caregivers of PWD in positive aspects of caregiving, stress, depression, quality of life, and burden; and the cognitive function and behavioral symptoms of the PWD immediate post-intervention (T1) and, 3-month follow-up (T2), compared with the control group.||Methods:||A two- arm non-randomized controlled trial will be adopted to achieve the research objectives. After considering the number of group size and previous studies about the sample size, a total of 60 subjects (30 pairs of dyads-PWD and caregivers) will be recruited from four elderly community centers in Hong Kong (15 pairs for each group) with convenience sampling.||Participants from the Intervention group will attend the home-based dyadic MCS group, while the control group will receive the usual care. The outcomes measurements of caregivers (positive caregiving experience, perceived stress, caregiver burden, and quality of life) and PWD (cognitive function and behavioral symptoms) will be assessed by a blinded assessor at baseline (T0), immediately post intervention (T1) , and 3 month-follow up (T2). To understand the therapeutic components and identify the strengths, limitations and difficulties of the home based dyadic MCS program, process evaluation will be conducted through focus group interviews with 15 MCS participants after the intervention. In order to obtain a broad spectrum of views about the intervention, participants will be purposely selected for interview based on their level of stress reduction after the intervention.||IBM SPSS 23.0 will be used for the data analyses. Mixed multi-variate modeling or MANOVA test will be performed to investigate the between-group effect, the within-group effect (Times: T0, T1, and T2) and the interaction effect (Group x Time) on all of the outcomes variables.

NCT03597360,"Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a disorder of uncertain cause and pathogenesis that primarily affects older adults. It accounts for more than 50 percent of cases of dementia in the elderly and is a leading source of morbidity and mortality in the aging population. The most essential and often earliest symptom is selective memory impairment. While treatments can improve some symptoms, there is no cure or disease-modifying therapy, and the disease inevitably progresses in all patients. The mainstay of management is still symptomatic treatment of behavioral disturbances, environmental manipulations to prevent behavioural disturbances, and counseling with respect to safety issues.||The goal of this project is to determine whether low doses of ionizing radiation (LDIR) from repeat CT scanning improves function, cognition and/or behavior in severe AD. This is based upon the treatments given in 2015 to a patient in hospice in the USA with advanced AD. On July 23, she received two CT scans of her brain. Two weeks later she received a third CT scan, and two weeks after this, a fourth CT scan. She partially improved and was discharged to an Alzheimer care home.||In terms of the mechanism whereby CT scanning might lead to improvement, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced abundantly and constantly by aerobic metabolism in all organisms, damaging biomolecules including those in the brain. AD is postulated to be caused by the accumulation of oxidative stress damage in the brain that was not prevented, repaired or removed by the patient's own biological protective mechanisms. These systems, characterized genetically, operate against all toxins regardless of whether they are produced endogenously or by external physical, chemical or biological agents. As people age, their protection systems become progressively weaker. LDIR is postulated to stimulate adaptive protection systems. This may produce beneficial effects including improvement in AD symptoms. With about three-quarters of human tissue being water, most of the initial radiation-induced damage is radiolysis of water, producing ROS and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). LDIR leads to mild oxidative stress and strong signaling, which up-regulates protection.The degree of stimulation likely depends upon individual genetic factors.||CT scans are approved for clinical diagnostic imaging. Approval will be requested from the Research Ethics Board (REB) at Baycrest Health Sciences and from Health Canada to use CT scanning for the experimental treatment of AD. If this pilot study is successful, i.e., if improvement is observed in the participants, then a proposal will be prepared for more comprehensive clinical studies of this novel treatment.",Dementia

NCT03734289,"To address the previously unanswered question of whether theoretically-driven caregiver education and coaching in nonpharmacologic approaches to reduce care resistant behaviors as a trigger of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and neuropsychiatric symptoms after Traumatic Brain Injury (NPTBI) will improve caregiver burden, quality of life (QOL), and related outcomes of patients with these conditions and their family members. The intervention of interest is the Neurobehavioral Non-Pharmacologic Supportive Strategies for Family Caregivers of Persons with Dementia or TBI (NeuroNS-Care). Behavioral symptoms in dementia and following TBI vary considerably over time, with a tendency toward spontaneous regression to the mean. Additionally, caregivers often develop idiosyncratic strategies in response to adverse behaviors that might be either adaptive or maladaptive. In order to separate the effects of time alone from the effects of the coaching intervention, one group will be randomized to delayed intervention following a 6 week wait time. This will allow the investigative team the opportunity to compare the natural history of the outcome variables in an ""untrained"" portion of the sample to the effects of training over a similar time period.",Dementia

NCT02432222,"Participants||Older adults age 65 and older, both males and females, with normal or corrected vision and hearing. Participants will require a diagnosis of dementia, with no other known comorbid cognitive or neurological impairments.||Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three groups||Visual arts intervention group|Music intervention group|Waitlist control group (receiving the intervention after the completion of both testing sessions).||Data analysis||Mixed 2x3 analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each construct, with within-subject factor of time (pre-intervention and post-intervention) and between-subject factor of group (visual arts, music, control).|Test for confounding effects of background factors (socioeconomic status, education level, gender, activity participation).|Mediation analyses for effects of mood on cognition and behaviour.||Procedure||The present study is a randomized controlled trial assessing three groups of dementia patients: a visual art group, a music group, and a non-art waitlist control group. Randomized control trials are needed in dementia research because few experimental studies exist to support that training has a causal influence on dementia related decline. Older adults with dementia will be allocated to either a visual art group, music group, or waitlist control group. Using two arts forms enables us to have active control groups to examine the specificity of observed effects.||To address inconsistencies and methodological issues in existing results, the current study will use rigorous experimental control, such as allocation concealment, adequate sample size, and tester blinding. Based on a power calculation using effect sizes from previous studies, each group will have sixty participants for an adequately powered sample. Participants will be recruited by contacting activity administrators at dementia retirement residences and day programs. Attention has and will be taken to prevent attrition, such as tailoring interventions towards participants' needs and capacities, and by involving families and caregivers in the research. Furthermore, the intervention and assessments will be conducted at the participant's respective care facility. Currently, the investigators have an established partnership with day dementia programs in the Toronto area, and will be negotiating agreements to work with other senior retirement residences and day programs. Recruiting from multiple locations and randomly assigning participants to experimental or control groups will help with generalizability of results.||Following previous studies, the art interventions will take place over ten weeks (one hour per day, two days per week). The visual art course will be a drawing course focusing on basic visual art concepts (such as shape and contrast) and the music course will be a singing and instrumental course focusing on basic music concepts (such as rhythm and melody). Defining training elements will delineate the specific effects of different activities on cognition, a poorly explored area in previous studies. The visual arts and music courses will be taught by the study's graduate student investigators (Annalise D'Souza and Katherine Matthews). Both teachers have experience and accreditations in their respective art.||Before and after both courses, all participants (wait-list control group included) will complete multiple assessment tasks. Data will be analyzed using mixed analyses of variance to compare performance for each participant at both testing sessions, and between groups. The pre-tests will occur one to two weeks before the beginning of the arts courses, and the post-tests will occur during the two weeks after the art courses are finished. Testing will occur over a two day period, for one hour per day to accommodate participants attention span and cognitive load. All tasks have been selected for their reliability, validity, and their suitability to the population at hand. To investigate specific influences of each art, separate visual and auditory/verbal tests will be used for each measure. Testing and courses will begin in early 2015, and will be run multiple times at different locations to reach the targeted sample size, with expected start dates in April, September, and January. Participant recruitment for these courses will begin in April and continue until December. Based on previous discussions with dementia day programs, and the attrition and admission rates of these programs, attaining sixty participants per group by December will be possible if the investigators continue recruiting from multiple day programs and retirement residences.||The participants' involvement in the study is completely voluntary and the participant and their caregiver (if substitute consent is required) may choose to stop their participation at any time. In the event the participant withdraws from the study all associated collected data will be immediately destroyed wherever possible. All information the participant supplies during the study will be held in confidence. Confidentiality will be provided to the fullest extent possible by law.||Hypotheses||Predictions are outlined in the hypotheses below:||Visual art and music training will offset some of the decline in cognitive functions (working memory, long-term memory, selective attention, dual-tasking, and task switching).||a. Effects of visual art will be greater on visual measures of cognition and effects of music will be greater on auditory measures||Visual art and music training will improve mood and lessen problematic behavior.|Visual art and music training will improve overall quality of life.|Mood will mediate some of the changes in cognition and behaviour||Background||The present study focuses on non-pharmacological art interventions for persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Arts interventions will be designed and implemented to investigate the effects of arts training on disease symptomology and overall quality of life for persons with dementia. Dementia can be characterized by declining cognitive functions, accompanied by a loss of daily functioning (DSM-IV, 2000), with a range of cognitive, behavioural, and psychological deficits for different types of dementia.||The study will use a randomized controlled trial to test efficacy of two arts interventions. Arts and dementia experts will guide intervention design to ensure that programs are powerful and controlled. With the aims of reliability and applicability, interventions will be created that can be tested by future researchers and applied by real-world practitioners. Effects will be evaluated with a broad range of measures (affective, cognitive, and behavioural. The proposed study is significant for two reasons. First, it addresses a repeatedly highlighted need for non-pharmacological interventions in treating dementia. Second, it looks beyond disease treatment alone by looking to also improve overall quality of life in patients with dementia.||Non-pharmacological interventions offer great potential for mental improvement, but further experimental research is needed before efficacy is established. A large evidence base demonstrates a cognitive benefit of arts on healthy older adults. It is uncertain however, whether such findings also apply to individuals with dementia. A few preliminary studies indicate similar benefits can be found, but not all studies have reported cognitive improvements following arts interventions in this patient population. In addition, prospective studies indicate a link between dementia and cognitively stimulating activities such as the arts. For example, it has been supported that older adults who participate in more stimulating activities also display fewer incidences of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.||Research suggests that non-pharmacological treatments should be used as a first line of action against dementia, while pharmacological treatments should serve as a second-line approach. While non-pharmacological treatments have indicated remedial effects, there is a need for reliably conducted experiments to establish efficacy. Art recreation is easy to administer, inexpensive and non-time consuming. Unlike the majority of current pharmacological treatments, it is a noninvasive and pleasurable activity, and maintains the personhood of the individual with dementia.||Note: Music intervention dropped prior to study initiation, due to insufficient participant recruitment.",Dementia

NCT00119561,"Background: Caregiving can severely limit caregivers' lives. In order to keep their family member at home, dementia caregivers often experience physical and psychological strain, social isolation, loss of time for self, and inability to obtain and/or afford assistance with caregiving tasks. The amount of time spent in providing care for a family member with dementia contributes to these problems. Dementia caregivers report spending around 18 hours per day in caregiving tasks and 3 hours per day in supervision. The high levels of stress involved in caring for a dementia patient and the widespread lack of training in such care can lead to a vicious cycle of ever-increasing health care dependency, first for the patient and secondly for informal caregivers. Telephone Support Groups have the potential to address caregivers' stress, isolation and education about dementia and its management, leading to sustainable informal caregiving and lower healthcare use and overall VHA expenditures for the veteran patient with dementia.||Objectives: Study objectives are to 1) examine Telephone Support Groups' effectiveness for caregivers, 2) determine whether Telephone Support results in decreases in VHA health care use and costs for the veteran, and decreased VHA and/or non-VHA use and costs for the caregiver, and 3) examine the intervention's effect on caregivers' time spent providing care. The long-term objective is to develop and disseminate the protocol and materials for effective Telephone Support Groups that can be used across the VHA system.||Methods: This randomized clinical trial of 154 caregivers (Black/African American, White/Caucasian, rural, urban) compared dementia caregivers participating in Telephone Support Groups to caregivers whose family members with dementia were receiving usual care. Either the caregiver or the patient had to be a veteran receiving care at the VAMC Memphis. In the treatment condition, there were 15 year-long support groups of one trained group leader and 5 to 6 caregivers. Each support group met 14 times. The one hour calls were semi-structured conference calls with education, coping skills and cognitive restructuring, and support components. A Caregiver Notebook with information on each topic provided materials for the educational sessions. Topics included knowledge of dementia, safety, caregiver health and well being, communication, managing behavioral challenges, and caregiver stress and coping. A workshop focusing on the same behavior management and stress topics was offered to Usual Care caregivers at the end of their participation.||Data were collected in caregivers' homes by trained Research Associates at baseline, six and twelve months.

NCT00495820,"Objective: Apathy is one of the earliest and most profound disturbances that occur in Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Based on promising preliminary data from our open-label pilot study we propose a double blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of methylphenidate for treatment of apathy in AD.||Research Design: Randomized double blind, placebo-controlled study which will evaluate the effect of methylphenidate on apathy and also the impact of improvement of apathy on caregiver burden and functional status.||Hypotheses: 1. Methylphenidate will improve apathy significantly more than placebo in AD.||2. Successful treatment of apathy will improve Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), and caregiver burden.||Methodology: 60 patients with apathy in the context of AD will be recruited over the next three years. In our proposed study patients will be recruited from relevant clinics at the Omaha Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) including clinics in Geriatric Psychiatry, Neurology, Primary Care and Geriatric Medicine. 30 patients each with AD and apathy will be randomly assigned to placebo or MPH. All patients in the methylphenidate arm will be started at 5mg twice daily and titrated to 10mg twice daily at two weeks. Patients will be continued in this arm for 12 weeks followed by a 2-week discontinuation phase. Patients will be assessed on regular intervals using the Apathy Evaluation Scale, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Zarit Burden Scale and Mini Mental State Examination.||Findings: None, the study is not complete.||Clinical Relationships: While memory is the key cognitive problem in AD, apathy is the key behavioral problem. Apathy is characterized by indifference, disengagement, passivity, and lack of enthusiasm, interest, empathy and interpersonal involvement. Apathy is the most common, one of the earliest and probably the most persistent of behavioral problems in AD. Apathy is the most disturbing behavior to caregivers and has the greatest impact on functional status and caregiver burden.||Despite this, apathy as a behavioral problem has largely been neglected. Most of the research directed towards behavioral problems in dementia is targeted towards more visible behaviors such as agitation, and psychosis. Remarkably, there are no published randomized, double blind, placebo controlled studies in the treatment of apathy associated with AD.||Impact/Significance: Around 1.4 million veterans suffer from apathy in association with AD. Apathy is a strong predictor for functional decline and caregiver burden. Treatment of apathy is remarkably understudied and is absolutely critical to allow veterans to maximize their functional status, social engagement and quality of life, and thus delaying placement in assisted living or nursing home settings.",Dementia
NCT03888222,"This proposal will evaluate the effects of Bosutinib (Bosulif, Pfizer®) treatment - an FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets c-Abelson (Abl) and Src tyrosine kinases- in patients with DLB. Investigators have demonstrated safety and efficacy of this compound in pre-clinical animal models and others have shown similar benefits of Bosutinib on inflammation and neurotoxic protein clearance in neurodegeneration. Investigators have demonstrated that Bosutinib enters the brain (5% CSF:plasma ratio) and inhibits Abl at lower doses (5mg/kg) than the cancer dose (80mg/kg) in animals. Bosutinib also reduces the levels of neurotoxic proteins including alpha-synuclein, tau and beta-amyloid and improves motor and cognitive behavior in models of neurodegeneration. The use of Bosutinib is a novel strategy that promotes autophagy to clear neurotoxic protein aggregates in neurons. Bosutinib is FDA-approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) at an oral dose of 400-600 mg daily.

NCT00249158,"Dementia is a term used for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of diseases or injuries that affect the brain. Individuals with dementia have a loss of function in cognition (thinking, perception, learning, verbal communication, memory, judgment), which may lead to behavioral and personality changes (for example, agitation, delusions, hallucinations). Some causes of dementia are reversible; however, irreversible dementia is caused by certain conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. Dementia is common in elderly individuals, but it is not a normal part of aging. This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study comparing the effectiveness and safety of risperidone to placebo in patients with behavioral disturbances associated with dementia. The study is composed of two periods: a 1-week run-in period in which patients are discontinued from other antipsychotic drugs and take placebo twice daily and a 12-week double-blind period. At the end of the run-in period, patients are randomly assigned to oral solutions of either risperidone or placebo. The starting dose of risperidone is 0.25 mg twice daily and increasing to 0.5 mg twice daily (1 mg/day). If 1 mg/day shows an insufficient response, a maximum of 1 mg twice daily of risperidone is permitted. The patient receives study drugs for the 12-week double-blind period. The primary measure of effectiveness is the change from baseline to the end of double-blind treatment in the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), a questionnaire evaluating agitation. Additional measures of efficacy include the change from baseline to end of double-blind treatment in the Behavior Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), a rating scale used to evaluate behavior symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease; the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), a rating system used to evaluate the overall and severity of clinical change in a patient with various diseases affecting the brain; the Functional Assessment Staging (FAST), a diagnosis tool for determining the stage of dementia; and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a clinical measure used to evaluate cognition. Safety evaluations include the incidence of adverse events; results of clinical laboratory tests (hematology and biochemistry); measurements of vital signs and body weight; physical examination findings; and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale used to measure effects of antipsychotic medications on motor functions of the patient. The study hypothesis is that risperidone is more effective than placebo, as measured by the total aggression score on the CMAI, in treating behavioral disturbances in demented patients. Risperidone oral solution (1 mg/mL). Starting doses of 0.25 mg twice daily and increasing to 0.5 mg twice daily (1 mg/day).

NCT00416169,"Pick Complex (PC) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are a group of neurodegenerative dementias, initially characterized by frontotemporal lobar atrophy, that have overlapping clinical presentations and pathologic findings. Although the pathogenesis of Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia remains unknown, and the neurotransmitter changes in Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia are not well characterized, there is evidence for decreased cholinergic receptor binding in several cortical regions and decreased serotonin binding in the hypothalamus, frontal cortex, and temporal cortex. Galantamine is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor. Recent studies indicate that galantamine is also an allosteric modulator at nicotinic cholinergic receptor sites. This nicotinic modulation appears to not only potentiate the response to acetylcholine binding, but also to modulate release of several other neurotransmitters, including serotonin. This pilot study will explore the safety and tolerability and efficacy of galantamine 8 mg and 12 mg twice a day treatment in subjects with Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia. The study comprises an 18 week, open label, galantamine treatment phase followed by an 8 week, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled withdrawal phase. The safety and tolerability of galantamine therapy will be explored during both the open label and randomized withdrawal periods. The 8 week randomized withdrawal period will be used to confirm the safety of galantamine withdrawal in this subject group and its impact on possible symptom improvement achieved during the open label period as a marker for efficacy.||The expectation is that subjects who remain on galantamine for the additional 8 weeks will continue to improve or will remain stable with regard to their behavior, language, cognition, and global function, whereas subjects who are assigned to placebo will show a decline in some of these functions. This approach will allow an assessment of the effects of galantamine treatment (challenge) and galantamine withdrawal (de-challenge).||This study will involve a maximum of 40 subjects with Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia. Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive galantamine 4 mg twice a day for 4 weeks followed by 8 mg twice a day for 4 weeks. At 8 weeks, the dose of galantamine will be maintained at 8 mg or increased to 12 mg twice a day based on tolerability. At the end of 12 weeks the dose of galantamine will be maintained at 8 or 12 mg twice a day or reduced to 8 mg twice a day, based on tolerability. The dose will be fixed for the remainder of the open label treatment period. Following 18 weeks of galantamine treatment, subjects will be randomly assigned (1:1) to continued treatment with galantamine (at the same dose) or placebo for an additional 8 weeks. Subjects and caregivers will be contacted by phone during the study and encouraged to contact the site at any time if they have concerns. If the subject's symptoms appear to be substantially worsening, and the investigator determines that the subject has deteriorated, he will advise the subject and caregiver about possible early completion of the study (early escape). Subjects electing early escape will complete final efficacy and safety assessments, then discontinue study medication. Once they have completed the study, they will begin the treatment of their choice in consultation with their physician. Subjects will be seen for assessment at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (baseline), Visits 3 and 4 (12 and 18 weeks after the start of open label galantamine treatment), and Visit 5 (8 weeks after the start of the double blind withdrawal period or at early escape) or upon premature discontinuation. The subject and caregiver will return for an unscheduled visit if, in the judgment of the investigator, the subject requires clinical assessment between visits.||Subject selection criteria will ensure inclusion of subjects who have a clinical diagnosis of Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia established by published consensus criteria and supported by neuroradiologic confirmation. The subjects selected for the study will have a diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia or frontotemporal dementia.||Safety and tolerability will be monitored by assessment of adverse events, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and laboratory tests. Efficacy on symptoms will be explored by measuring changes in the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI), the Aphasia Quotient (AQ) of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS), the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Scale, the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scales of Severity or Change, and subscales of the WAB and FBI. Changes in the results of neurologic examinations will also be documented.||The descriptive analyses will be performed, no hypotheses are specified for statistical testing. Safety and efficacy assessments will be summarized. Safety and Efficacy changes will be calculated from the screening/baseline of the galantamine treatment period to Week 18 (open label galantamine treatment period) and Week 26 (entire study for subjects randomized to galantamine for the 8 week withdrawal period). Comparisons between the placebo and galantamine treatment groups will use the changes in safety and efficacy parameters from Weeks 18 to 26 (the double blind, placebo controlled, randomized withdrawal period). Using a flexible dosing regimen, subjects will receive galantamine as oral tablets up to 8 or 12 mg twice per day for 18 weeks. Subjects will then be randomly assigned (1:1) in a double blind fashion to galantamine at the same dose or to placebo for an additional 8 weeks of treatment.",Dementia
NCT03996460,"Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is an alpha-synucleinopathy and the second most common form of dementia in the elderly. DLB shares striking neuropathological and clinical similarities with both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). DLB and PD are characterized by death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the nigro-striatal system and formation of intra-neuronal alpha-synuclein inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LBs). Misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates within LBs and apha-synuclein (SYN) is the highest genetic risk factor for PD and DLB followed by the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) . At autopsy alpha-synuclein, hyper-phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid plaques are all detected in the brains of individuals with DLB. Therefore, the neuropathology of DLB overlaps with both PD and AD, and includes alpha-synuclein accumulation in LBs, p-tau and beta-amyloid deposition . Potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, including alpha-synuclein, dopamine metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) , total tau and p-tau and amyloid beta peptides (Abeta 40/42) may be commonly shared in AD, PD and DLB. The core clinical features of DLB, include dementia and Parkinsonism in addition to hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorders (RBD) . L-Dopa replacement therapies and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may partially control motor and cognitive symptoms, respectively in DLB. Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and antipsychotics manage the behavioral but worsen motor symptoms in DLB. There is a major unmet medical need for further research into DLB to identify potential therapies for this disease and provide significant insights into the treatment of other Parkinsonian and memory disorders. A major challenge facing DLB is to develop a therapy that can halt neuronal death and alleviate cognitive, motor and behavioral symptoms. No therapeutic approach exists to alter the levels of neurotoxic proteins such as alpha-synuclein and halt DA and other neuronal death in DLB. One mechanism to degrade neurotoxic proteins is autophagy , which is a process by which the cell can degrade its own contents. There is evidence that autophagy is impaired in neurodegeneration , leading to failure of degradation of protein aggregates, including misfolded alpha-synuclein. Importantly, autophagy is exploited therapeutically in several diseases, including adult chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) induce autophagy, leading to destruction of rapidly dividing tumor cells in CML and degradation of neurotoxic proteins, including alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid and p-tau in PD and AD models. Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Limited (SPARC Ltd.) is developing K0706, for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that is resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy or Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) that is resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy; and its ability to slow down progression of PD. Using allometric scaling and an average human body weight of 70kg an oral dose of 15-30mg/kg once daily in mice corresponds to an oral human equivalent dose (HED) of 85-160 mg which is within the tolerated dose in both CML and PD. Therefore, the effects of 96 mg K0706 and 192 mg K0706 versus matching placebo taken daily by mouth for 12 weeks, followed by a 4 week wash-out period will be evaluated in individuals diagnosed with DLB. The data obtained from this study will serve as a proof of concept for future placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in patients diagnosed with DLB, AD, or PD.",Dementia

NCT02106065,"According to VA estimates, nearly 500,000 Veterans suffer from dementia. There is currently no cure for dementia. Ultimately, dementia will have a large impact on quality of life in Veterans and families, lead to expensive nursing home placement, and decrease life expectancy for patients and family caregivers. The experience of high burden in a caregiver for a Veteran with dementia increases the likelihood of permanent nursing home placement and can separate Veterans from their families. To address the high burden of caring for a Veteran with dementia, the investigators aim to study the effect of a rehabilitative intervention for family caregivers of Veterans with dementia. This novel approach will use video technology that can reach caregivers in rural areas who do not have easy access to major VA medical centers.",Dementia
NCT04165213,"PHASE 1a - The Online Training Program - We will develop ten self-paced online learning modules. These modules will enable OTs and RNs to participant to have anytime/anywhere access to content and activities to aid their learning. The modules will include rich multimedia content and interactive assessments to keep the learner engaged. The modules will allow for easy packaging of the content into the latest interoperability standards for such content including the latest Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) specifications, which will allow for repurposing and sharing with other institutions.||To accommodate diversity of learning needs, the modules will be designed using a hyperlearning model with four dimensions. The general principles will begin with the module learning objectives and follow with a review of core concepts and required and/or self-directed learning activities. The mini-lecture component of the modules will include information on the major concepts of the module. Since the modules will be self-paced, the learner can take his/her time going through them and perform in the embedded interactive learning activities. The clinical reasoning dimension will provide the learner with an opportunity for problem-solving and clinical decision-making. This dimension will contain vignettes and case studies with questions requiring analysis and synthesis. The final dimension will be evaluation/ assessment of learning outcomes. This dimension will use teacher-made and standardized pre-and post-tests to assess attainment of specified learning outcomes. The self-paced modules will be highly interactive featuring integrated multimedia content, assessments, and learner evaluations to allow PACE staff to engage with the content at a high level and practice application in simulated scenarios. Each module will require approximately 45-60 minutes/module for the learner to complete. Participants can use the modules separately at different times throughout a training curriculum or they can be assigned at the beginning of a training time by having this information front-loaded.||To develop the modules, we will work intensely in year 01 with an instructional design team at Drexel University with specialists in dementia care, the COPE program and experts in simulation, use of standardized patients, and training of nurses and other health professionals from Penn, Trinity Health and Jefferson. We anticipate the modules to contain the following content: module 1 - introduction to COPE program, research evidence, and core principles underlying the program; module 2 - overview of delivery characteristics, role of RN and OT, three phases (assessment, implementation, generalizability) of the COPE program, permissible adaptations; module 3 and 4-assessment phase, introduction to clinical interview and all assessments and forms; module 5 and 6- implementation phase including helping caregiver identify 3 problem areas, engaging in problem solving and brainstorming, developing and providing an assessment report and offering prescriptions (strategies) for each identified problem area; module 7 and 8 - generalizability phase or helping caregivers use strategies for one problem area to address another and planning for the future; module 9- developing rapport and working with family caregivers from different backgrounds, cultures, living environments and relationships and helping families balance caregiving with other life roles, adjusting approach by level of readiness; module 10 - challenging cases, motivational interviewing, how to explain the program, how to meet caregivers where they are at and provide validation and support.||Scripts for each module will be developed and shared with OTs/RNs who are not part of the study but work within Trinity PACE programs. This will allow for continuous feedback loops to assure that the scenarios meet the needs of PACE staff. We will compare the online program to our traditional 3-day face-to-face training currently used with COPE.||The 3-day training program will be conducted by Dr. Piersol using a slide deck and case presentations as we have previously done. The comparison of the two training programs is described in Phase 2 and 3 below.||PHASE 1b -The Fidelity Monitoring Program- We seek to develop a scalable approach to assess fidelity to the COPE Program when it is implemented in a real-world setting such as PACE using computational linguistics techniques (e.g. natural language processing). The essence of fidelity to the Core Principles of COPE program will be captured by using automatic classification programs that evaluate both the content that should be included in COPE sessions, and the style of delivery. While automatic classification programs have been applied to measure quality metrics of transcribed narratives in the field of psychotherapy (21), it has not been used to measure other aspects of quality- namely fidelity to evidence-based practices or dementia care and caregiver supportive programs. The development of the automated Fidelity Monitoring Program will occur in three steps and will be carried out by a technical team consisting of an expert in content analysis, Dr. Ani Nenkova, and a consultant expert in speech recognition and prosody, Dr Mari Ostendorf. Co- I Nenkova has worked extensively on automatic summarization, evaluation of automatic summarization and readability and linguistic style. The ultimate goal of our efforts is to develop a system that- given a recording of a COPE delivery session (e.g. in real time immediately after interaction between the clinician and the caregiver)- produces a three-tiered score, indicating if the fidelity was 'excellent', 'acceptable' or 'problematic'. Special emphasis will be given to the accuracy of identifying 'problematic' COPE fidelity which is not fateful to training and may not produce the same desired outcomes as intervention delivered with higher fidelity. First, we will obtain n-best list speech recognition of the COPE interaction . This will help mitigate recognition errors in the next stage. Until recently, audio recording transcription was fraught with challenges particularly in sessions involving two or more speakers. Advances in audio signaling and speech recognition have brought technology for automating language analysis within reach. Recent research has suggested that text based features may be more effective than using audio features alone when classifying fidelity in behavioral research (47). Automatic speech recognition software will be used to transcribe sessions and the resulting words will be used in a text-based model of fidelity. All COPE training, practice and implementation sessions will be audio taped with participant consent. There are several of automatic speech recognition tools that we can use. We will pick the one that best balances accuracy of recognition in our domain and privacy.Once the transcripts are obtained, there are two approaches that we will develop and contrast: (1) comparison with a reference delivery and (2) a supervised classification approach. The first has the advantage of needing only a small number of excellent deliveries and several acceptable deliveries, for each of the seven dimensions, while the other needs a larger set of labeled data but would potentially lead to higher accuracy of prediction.||Comparison or similarity to reference (Steps A and B): Our approach will leverage techniques widely used in the evaluation of automatically produced content, such as machine translation and automatic text summarization. In these applications it is not feasible to track system improvement with human judgments of quality. Instead, most of the progress is measured by computing similarity between a set of sample reference text (i.e. what a 'good' translation or a 'good' summary would be) and the system output. Such automatic evaluation approaches are widely used for machine translation (48) and summarization (49). While there have been some concerns that the automatic measures are not fine enough to distinguish between levels of very good context, these measures show strong ability to distinguish 'very bad' content (50,51), (or poor fidelity) aligns with the needs of our project.||In Step A we will compile 10 examples of 'excellent' COPE fidelity deliveries, with the regions where desired aspects is expressed will be explicitly marked, i.e. marked parts where person-environment fit is discussed, or parts of the interaction where the clinician asks open ended questions or confirms the caregiver understanding of the content. Next, new interactions will be ranked by their similarity with the reference 'excellent' interactions (52). In Step 2 we will identify 'problematic' fidelity deliveries. We will make use of 10 negative examples of 'acceptable' but imperfect deliveries. If the new interaction ranks lower than most of these, it will be considered unacceptable or 'problematic'. Parameters and decision rules will be developed at this step to determine cut-off levels for declaring an interaction problematic.||Determination of ""excellent"" versus ""problematic"" fidelity ratings of the audio recordings will be assessed by Drs Hirshman and Renz (who were not the original developers of COPE and thus they offer an independent review) using the COPE Adherence Scale developed for the original clinical trial in order to evaluate the extent to which core treatment principles were implemented effectively. Ratings from the Adherence Scale have been standardized such that 1.00 represents perfect fidelity and 0.00 represent complete non-fidelity. The scale was previously modeled off of the NIH REACH I and II fidelity approach. Findings from the combined fidelity ratings will be used to refine the automated fidelity program into a ""best model"" to be tested in Step C (53).||Supervised classification (Step C) For this approach, we will need to examine all recorded sessions (600+). We will train a supervised classifier or a regression model to predict the score (1 to 3, corresponding to excellent, acceptable and problematic) of a given interaction. We will experiment with a number of classifiers, including deep learning frameworks and more traditional support vector machine and (logistic) regression models.The resulting final validation set of 100 labeled interactions will serve to finalize the best model for fidelity prediction.||PHASE 2 - Evaluation of Online Training Program in Interventionist Uptake and Fidelity Phase 2 of this study involves a series of activities designed to evaluate the whether an online training program is the same or better in improving interventionist uptake of- and fidelity to- COPE principles and protocols compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training.||PHASE 3 (Aim 3) - Efficacy of COPE on PACE participant outcomes by type of COPE training.||This aim will be accomplished by evaluating dyad outcomes of the COPE program under the two different training approaches. Following training, each of the PACE organizations will enroll 5 persons with dementia and their caregivers in the study. This will yield 50 family dyads (25 dyads in traditional training sites and 25 dyads in online training sites).",Dementia
NCT03357328,"People with dementia often have fragmented night-time sleep, prolonged night-time awakenings and increased daytime sleep. Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) (e.g. agitation, depression) are also common. Noticeably, both sleep problems and BPSD are related to a disturbed circadian rhythm. Light is the most important input to the circadian system, and exposure to sufficient daylight is important for entrainment of the circadian rhythm to the surroundings. Dementia patients living in nursing homes (NH) are less exposed to daylight than dementia patients living at home. Bright light therapy is a promising treatment in these patients as it may improve sleep, BPSD, and independent functioning. However, traditional bright light treatment has not been routinely employed in NH patients or patients with dementia. This may be related to difficulties in achieving adherence to the traditional treatment and thus the benefit of bright light therapy for people with dementia still remains unclear.||DEM.LIGHT uses modern LED (light-emitting diodes) technology that enables light therapy with the least possible interference of the day-to-day life in NHs, as the treatment is not confined to a light source presupposing behavioural compliance. Ceiling-mounted LED-sources can be programmed in terms of timing, light intensity and colour temperature. DEM.LIGHT uses this to provide therapy light rooms with a dynamic light condition that better emulates natural light throughout the day. The study is a cluster-randomized trial evaluating the effect of therapy light rooms on various measures of physical and mental health in NH patients with dementia. Data will be collected at baseline, after 8 and 16 weeks of treatment, and at the end of the intervention period (24 weeks).",Dementia

NCT00105638,"Background:||This study was designed to evaluate the impact of a Telehealth Education Program (TEP) on outpatient veterans with moderate to severe dementia and their spouse caregivers. The TEP is a program of education, coping skills, problem solving and support presented to caregivers of veterans with dementia by teleconference in 10 weekly, one-hour sessions. The TEP was based on a stress and coping model aimed to enhance the knowledge, skills and feelings of support of the caregivers who participated.||Objectives:||The objectives of this study were to: 1) evaluate the impact of TEP on outpatient veterans with dementia; and 2) to help spousal caregivers gain the knowledge and skills necessary to provide the highest quality of care possible for their spouse in order to prevent unnecessary healthcare utilization and premature institutionalization. In addition, a second objective was to develop a TEP training manual for VA clinical staff and a TEP workbook for family members.||Methods:||This study employed a 2x3x2x4 randomized control group design. The design had two levels of intervention, TEP verus usual care(UC), three times of measurement (baseline, 3 months and 12 months), two sites of educational group intervention, (Albany VAMC and Buffalo VAMC) and four leaders (two nestled at each of the two sites). Veterans were included into the study if: 1) they were community dwelling; 2) had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, or a related dementing disorder, and 3) scored three or higher on the Global Deterioration Scale. Caregivers were included if they: 1) were the primary care providers for the veterans, 2) had cohabitated with the veteran for more than one year, 3) reported at least a moderate level of strain, (score a seven or higher on the Caregiver Strain Index), and (4) had not participated in any other individual or group intervention program designed to support caregivers of demented persons.||There were ten TEP caregiver groups that received the educational program in one-hour sessions for 10 weeks. Demographic data were collected on the veterans and caregivers at baseline. Psychosocial outcome data were collected within two weeks prior to the intervention(baseline) and then again at three and twelve months. These were collected to evaluate whether TEP veterans would experience a reduction in behavioral problems, agitation and symptoms of depression and whether caregivers would experience a significant increase in dementia management skills, as well as, a perceived ability to care for their spouse. Outcome variables were analyzed using mixed effect regression models. Healthcare cost and utilization data were extracted from the VISTA databases and included outpatient, inpatient and nursing home data within the VA.||Status:||Completed.",Dementia

NCT02356055,"A. BACKGROUND: Progressive disability in activities of daily living (ADL) is inevitable for people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Attempts to slow or prevent ADL disability have been unsuccessful despite making progress in behavioral training methods. Missing from this research is an emphasis on how investigators maximize a patient's engagement during training and the rigorous examination of implementation protocols (dosing and training methods) which may advantage learning in people with ADRD. Our team addressed this gap with the development of the STOMP (Skill-building through Task-Oriented Motor Practice) intervention which creates methods for obtaining ADL goals that support ""personhood"" and tests high-intensity protocols that appear to advantage learning as well as sustained learning over time. Through our first specific aim, the investigators will examine the learning and retention of learning advantages offered through receipt of an intensive versus less-intensive STOMP protocol. In our second aim,the investigators will examine sustained attention to task during training as a differential contributor to our outcomes.||B. RESEARCH DESIGN/METHODS||Design: Randomized-controlled trial over a two-week intervention period and a 3-month post-intervention follow-up period that will occur over 24 months. The investigators will employ block randomization where participants are randomized in blocks of randomly chosen sets of two or four, ultimately resulting in eight participants randomized to each group in the first year and a total of 16 participants assigned to each group by the end of 20 months. Two occupational therapists (OT), blinded to group assignment will complete baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-up assessments. The treating occupational therapy assistant (OTA) will be given the group assignment by the PI after the baseline evaluation is complete.|Recruitment: The investigators intend to recruit 32 participants (through assent) and legally-authorized representatives (through informed consent) employing a variety of methods. The primary recruitment strategy will be the use of direct mailing which has been successfully used by other teams recruiting people with ADRD.9 A letter of invitation explaining the study and ways to participate will be mailed to zip codes adjacent to University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) through the United States Postal Service. Second, collaborating physicians (Drs. Hershey and Odenheimer) will refer appropriate candidates. Dr. Hershey, a neurologist specializing in dementia diagnosis and treatment with OUHSC, sees >200 people/year with various forms of dementia. Dr. Odenheimer, a neurologist with the VA sees 30 new patients/year with dementia and 45 unique return visits/year. Other forms of recruitment will include: media (e.g., campus emails, newspaper advertisements, websites, television news stories) and presentations at local chapters of the Alzheimer's Association support group. Previous recruitment has occurred primarily through media/presentations (60%) and physician recruitment (40%).|Procedures: Figure 2 clearly outlines the manualized study procedures which are taught to the OT/OTA through a 40-hour certification course. Protocol preparation: The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) includes a semi-structured interview that will assist the OT in facilitating family/participant chosen ADL, home management or leisure goals that support retention of personhood for the person with dementia. Goals chosen through the COPM are performed by the participant and assessed by the OT in order to develop measurable GAS outcomes. Each goal must have an identifiable beginning and concluding step for creation of ""practice-able"" steps for task-oriented training. Practice-able steps will embed both task modifications and assistive technology determined by the OT to support performance and will be situated contextually within the participant's habits and environment. To enhance transfer of training to the caregivers, we will invite caregivers to watch the intervention daily and require hands-on training of the intervention one day/week. The intervention protocol incorporates important multi-component features of motor learning. Each group will practice the task as many times as possible during their allotted time in training. For the intensive protocol, each hour of training will focus on 1 of 3 identified goals and will include 50 minutes of intervention and a 10 minute break. The less-intensive protocol is based on home health treatment protocols where patients are seen 1-2 days/week for one hour/day. In the less-intensive protocol, each of the 3 ADL goals will be practiced as many times as possible within 20 minutes of the scheduled hour. In both protocols, the OTA will employ errorless learning where the participant is prevented from making errors through scaffolded trainer guidance progressing from hand-over-hand training, provision of tactile and verbal cues and, if possible, no cues for errorless performance. Continuous verbal feedback will be provided to the participant initially and minimized as training progresses. Post-intervention, caregiver support for questions and problems interfering with continued practice is provided monthly until the 3-month follow-up.||Statistical Methods A two-sided 0.05 alpha level will be used to define statistical significance. An intent-to-treat paradigm will be followed in which data from all randomized patients are analyzed to intervention assignment without regard to adherence or outcomes.||Aim 1: Examine advantages to learning and retention of learning provided through receipt of the intensive STOMP protocol versus a less-intensive protocol.||Plan: Changes in pre- and post-intervention (immediate and 90 day) GAS T-scores/COPM mean scores will be compared between intervention groups using a repeated measures ANOVA where time by intervention interaction term will be tested to determine if the estimated effect of the intervention program differs over the follow-up period. Analyses will be stratified by post-intervention time point if a significant interaction is found. Residual diagnostics will be created to assess adequacy of modeling assumptions. Non-parametric analyses will be used, focusing on 3-month differences, if ANOVA modeling assumptions are not satisfied.||Aim 2: Examine sustained attention to task as a contributor to differential outcomes.||Plan: Using data from the Sustained Attention to Task behavioral form (Sec.3f), we will tally the amount of time spent on each of 3 ADL goals over the 2 week intervention. Total minutes on task will be categorized by tertiles and plotted against change in GAS and COPM scores, both post-intervention and the 3-month follow-up.||Study Timeline*||Patient follow-up completed by month 23 to assure time for final data analysis.|Data Management: Data capture, quality assurance, management, and processing will be consolidated through the use of the well-established Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system.10 REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing: 1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources. Online data capture forms will be created using REDCap, exported as pdf files, and printed for off-line use so that a hard copy will be available for data checks. REDCap will allow for multi-personnel access of project files and will be used by the PI, evaluators and trainer to capture data.||C. POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES Three hours of intervention daily may result in fatigue, refusals and displays of negative behaviors. Due to the repetitive nature of STOMP, we have tallied the number of negative behaviors to include wandering, purposeless movement, verbal and physical outburst and mood-related verbalizations and have averaged <1/hour across 3 hours of treatment in both settings.1,2 We believe this success is in part due to 1) using licensed OT/OTAs; 2) training the interventionists through a manualized, STOMP protocol which includes the identification of behavioral signs with specific redirections for negative behaviors; and 3) engaging the presence of the caregiver. Recruitment for our home-based studies has proven to be more palatable to community-dwelling older adults than clinic-based. Based on our previous work, we believe that the 30 day phone calls have largely influenced our ability to retain 100% of our participants at 90-day post-intervention follow-up.||D. HUMAN PARTICIPANT SAFETY The risk for participating in this study is similar to doing ADL tasks at home. Strict safety principles will be observed such as walking with a safety belt as deemed necessary. The benefits of participating in the study include assessment of deficits with an occupational therapist, receiving two weeks of free intervention, and provision of adaptive equipment that will support functional skills in the home. The investigators believe the benefits of participating outweigh the risks.",Dementia
NCT02956694,"Background: The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia causes new challenges in primary care. Indeed, primary care providers point to a need for more training to care for this population, especially seniors presenting behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. They also find the inter-professional nature of care, and the need to communicate with community services and families, very challenging. Moreover, patients living with dementia and their caregivers consistently report their need for more information about dementia. Therefore, in a recent survey, the investigators sought five difficult decisions that patients living with dementia and their informal caregivers often face in primary care settings. In the current study, they propose to tailor and evaluate an e-learning professional training program on shared decision making, comprising evidence summaries on the health options to consider before making these five difficult decisions. This tailored training program is expected to improve shared decision making between clinicians and patients with dementia and their caregivers, and in turn improve patient and caregiver empowerment in relation to their own health care.||Methods: In two phases, the aims of this study are to (1) design and tailor the intervention, and (2) implement and evaluate it. In the first phase, theory and user-centred design will be used to tailor a multifaceted intervention comprising a distance professional training program on shared decision making, and five shared decision-making tools dealing with difficult decisions often faced by seniors with dementia and their caregivers. Each tool will be designed in two versions, one for clinicians, and one for patients/caregivers. Forty-nine clinicians and 27 patients/caregivers will be invited to participate to three cycles of design-evaluation-feedback of each intervention components. Besides think-aloud and interview approaches, they will also complete questionnaires to identify the factors most likely to influence their adoption of shared decision making after exposure to the intervention. Thereafter, the intervention will be modified by adding/enhancing behaviour-change techniques targeting these factors. In the second phase, the effectiveness of this tailored intervention will be evaluated before/after implementation, in a two-armed, clustered randomized trial with a three-month follow-up. A convenience sample of primary care clinics and home care services will be enrolled in the province of Quebec (Canada), and health care providers who practice there will be recruited (mostly family physicians, nurses, and social workers). We will record participants' access to training component, and conduct telephone interviews with a purposeful sample of participants, half of whom completed training and the other half whom did not. The participants will also complete a survey before and after training, to assess their knowledge, and intention to adopt shared decision making. Three researchers will conduct a thematic qualitative analysis of the interviews, as per the theory of planned behaviour. We performed bivariate analyses with the survey data.||Discussion: The results of this study will allow modifying the training program to improve participation rates and, ultimately, uptake of meaningful sjared decision making with patients living with dementia.",Dementia
NCT00253123,"Dementia is a term used for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of diseases or injuries that affect the brain. Individuals with dementia have a loss of cognitive function (thinking, perception, learning, verbal communication, memory, judgment), which may lead to behavioral and personality changes (for example, agitation, delusions, hallucinations). Some causes of dementia are reversible; however, irreversible dementia is caused by certain conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. Dementia is common in elderly individuals, but it is not a normal part of aging. This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study comparing the effectiveness and safety of risperidone to placebo in patients with behavioral disturbances associated with dementia. The study is composed of a screening visit, followed by two study phases: a 1-week run-in period in which patients are discontinued from other antipsychotic drugs and receive placebo twice daily, and a 12-week double-blind period. At the end of the run-in period, patients are randomly assigned to one of three risperidone doses (0.5, 1, or 2 mg/day) or placebo. All patients randomized to risperidone start with 0.25 mg twice daily. During the first week of the double-blind period, patients assigned to the 1 mg/day dose group have their doses increased to 0.5 mg twice daily and patients assigned to the 2 mg/day dose group have their doses increased to 1 mg twice daily. These three assigned doses continue for an additional 11 weeks. The primary measure of effectiveness is the change from baseline in the clinical response, defined as a reduction of >= 30% from baseline on the total Behavior Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD) score. Additional efficacy testing includes the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), a rating system used to evaluate the overall and severity of clinical change in a patient with various diseases affecting the brain; the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), a questionnaire evaluating agitation that is completed by the patient's caregiver; the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS), a scale that measures activities of daily living (for example, toileting, dressing, grooming, feeding, etc.). Safety evaluations include the incidence of adverse events; results of clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis); measurements of vital signs; physical examination and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings; and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale used to measure effects of antipsychotic medications on motor functions of the patient. The study hypothesis is that risperidone is more effective than placebo, as measured by a change from baseline on the total BEHAVE-AD score, in treating behavioral disturbances in demented patients. Risperidone tablets (or placebo tablets) taken orally, starting with 0.25 mg twice daily, continuing at this dose for the 0.25 twice daily group and gradually increasing to either 0.5 mg twice daily or 1 mg twice daily in the other risperidone dose groups.

NCT02862210,"Behavioral symptoms of Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), including agitation, aggression, and inappropriate repetitive behaviors are common, distressing to patients and caregivers, often lead to institutionalization, and can be very difficult and expensive to treat. There is a dearth of medication for treating these symptoms in FTD. Typically, antidepressants and antipsychotic medications are prescribed - which low efficacy and, with the latter class, carry serious adverse effects such as parkinsonism and increased cardiovascular-related mortality. The investigators propose a study of the efficacy of lithium carbonate compared to placebo in the treatment of agitation, aggression, and inappropriate repetitive behaviors in 60 patients with FTD in a randomized, double-blind, two-arm parallel 12-week trial. Lithium is a highly effective treatment for mania and symptoms of agitation or aggression in bipolar disorder. It also inhibits tau aggregation and phosphorylation, leading to considerable interest in its use as a disease-modifying treatment for tauopathies such as FTD and Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, earlier trials using typical doses (i.e., doses prescribed for treatment of bipolar disorder) showed high incidence of serious adverse effects (including confusion and delirium). For the study proposed study the investigators will: 1) use lower doses and lower target serum concentrations than have preceding trials (shown in preliminary data from a Columbia study and data from other labs to be well-tolerated) and 2) target behavioral symptoms rather than cognitive outcomes.",Dementia

NCT02791776,"Idiopathic scoliosis is a deformity in three planes of space the child's spine and scalable teenager with growth. In adults is causing severe deformities of respiratory failure responsible and disabling back pain. Scoliosis is most often idiopathic without cause found that the genetic origin is being identified. It is detected by the school doctor, the doctor or pediatrician. The management is based primarily on monitoring small angle discoveries scoliosis and the orthopedic treatment of progressive scoliosis by the specialized services of pediatric orthopedics or rehabilitation as recommended by the HAS (February 2008). Surgical treatment is reserved for the orthopedic treatment failures or advanced scoliosis discovered too late.||The goal of surgery is to reduce as much as possible distortion in the three planes of space and avoid the progression of the deformity in adulthood. Its principle is to correct the deformity using instrumentation and maintain over time this correction with a bone graft. This is commonly called spinal fusion with instrumentation. The instrumentation includes all of the vertebral anchors connected to rods.||Indications are asked in each case most often in adolescence and sometimes in younger children and rarely in adulthood. The procedure performed in adolescence allows to benefit from a flexible spine still allowing good reduction of the deformation, a lesser neurological risk and good consolidation of the bony fusion guarantees a stable income in the long term.||Among all types of curves, thoracic scoliosis pose the problem of choosing the bends to be instrumented. This choice is an essential element for the initial correction and become the long-term. It is the result of a compromise between a long instrumentation that orchestrates all of the deformation to the detriment of the mobility of the lumbar spine and a shorter instrumentation that preserves mobility at the expense perhaps of a smaller reduction. These short instrumentations called selective thoracic instrumentation, the choice of the support or lower vertebra vertebra of instrumentation is an unsolved problem and is the subject of this work.||The immediate results of the posterior vertebral arthrodesis are assessed by the correction of the deformity in three planes of space: measuring the angle of the curvature in the coronal plane, analyzing the return of a physiological kyphosis in sagittal plane and correction of the vertebral rotation in the horizontal plane. The results for medium and long term are assessed by analyzing the maintenance of correction of the deformity and the evolution of the above spine and above underlying arthrodesis.

NCT03572855,"Degenerative adult scoliosis (ADS) results from age related changes leading to segmental instability, deformity and stenosis. Although the etiology is unclear, degenerative adult scoliosis is associated with progressive and asymmetric degeneration of the disc and facet joints, which typically leads to stenosis. By virtue of the narrowed spinal canal associated with the degeneration these patients frequently develop back pain, as well as leg pain, weakness, and numbness. With an aging population in the USA and an increased attention to quality of life versus cost issues in the current healthcare environment, degenerative adult scoliosis has become a considerable healthcare concern.||Patients with scoliosis demonstrate an altered gait pattern.Such differences include decreased step length and reduced range of motion in the upper and lower extremities asymmetry of trunk rotation and ground reaction force in three-dimensions. Previous research found a decrease in the muscular mechanical work associated with an increase of energy cost and a decrease in the muscular efficiency in a scoliosis population compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, scoliosis patients exert 30% more physical effort than healthy subjects to ensure habitual locomotion, and this additional effort requires a reciprocal increase of oxygen consumption. This altered gait pattern demonstrated by subjects with scoliosis may be due to changes in global postural control strategies caused by pain and the spinal deformity.||Previous research showed that scoliosis patients do not have impaired postural balance when compared to healthy controls, while several others did find an effect of scoliosis on postural balance. This discrepancy in findings may be due to differences in curve characteristics included and their effects on postural balance, curve types (single or double), number of different curve types, location of curves (thoracic and lumbar), and/or Cobb angles.||Bracing has been found to reduce pain within a short time in ADS patients. Custom-made rigid torso braces, similar to those commonly used for children, are sometimes used in ADS patients; however, only anecdotal evidence of their efficacy is available and problems with comfort and compliance are quite frequent. A new brace has recently become available, the Peak™ Scoliosis Brace (Aspen Medical Products), designed to alleviate pain in adult patients with chronic pain secondary to scoliosis. The Peak Scoliosis Brace led to some improvement of pain at 1 month in a group of adult women with scoliosis and chronic low back pain, but the quality of life did not change significantly. This is may be due to the very short follow-up time. The effect of these braces on functional tasks and activities of daily living including walking have not been studied either.||The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of spinal bracing using Peak™ Scoliosis Brace on pain and lower extremities kinematics of gait.||METHODS Design This study will be a repeated measurement design. This study will be a non-randomized, prospective, concurrent control cohort study of patients with adult degenerative scoliosis who are clinically indicated for brace intervention and will serve as their own controls via their own pre-treatment evaluation. The proposal design is based on highly recommended Bayesian Design along with the Bayesian and Gaussian analysis for such population and sample size.||Sample Thirty candidates with symptomatic ADS will be enrolled. The sample size needed to approach 80% statistical power for differences between conditions was estimated from the literature.17,23,24 An effect size index of f = 0.50 was estimated. For a desired power of 80% (1 - β = 0.80) and desired α = 0.05, the effect size index requires a minimum sample size of 26.||Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Thirty spinal deformity patients will be enrolled.||Patients will be classified using the adult deformity SRS-Schwab system.

They will then be scheduled for a test session in the lab. Each patient will be evaluated on 2 different occasions: first day of bracing, and 2±0.5 months post-bracing. Subjects will be fitted with 22 external reflective markers. These markers will be placed based on those validated and published in the literature. A static trial will be recorded with subjects positioned in a neutral, standing posture to create a reference for defining neutral joint angles. Each subject will perform a series of over-ground gait trials with self-selected speed. On all visits, subjects will walk 10 meters, stepping on three sequenced force platforms. Subjects will perform a series of gait trials until five acceptable trials are obtained. In addition, each subject will perform 2 additional tests: 1. Timed up and go, and 6 minutes' walk test. After completion of functional testing, the brace will be fitted to each subject by a spine orthopedic surgeon before the testing. The subject will wear the fitted brace for at least 45 minutes prior to retesting. The subject will then repeat the functional testing as mentioned above. Total time required for each subject to participate in one session will be approximately 90 minutes.Three-dimensional (3D) kinematic data will be recorded at 120 Hz via a Vicon-Peak system (Vicon Nexus 2.0 Inc.). Ground reaction force (GRF) (AMTI Corp.) data will be recorded simultaneously at 1200 Hz. Spine, pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle kinematics and GRF will be analyzed using a custom MATLAB program.||Clinical Data Collection Prior to each gait evaluation, patients will be asked to complete a visual analog scale (VAS) to assess back and leg pain intensity, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, version 2.1.a), a pain drawing to record symptom location. Patients will also complete an SRS-22r, Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) to record how their spinal deformity affects them across several physical and psycho-social domains. Long cassette sagittal and coronal radiographs will be collected at first visit before brace fitting to assess the extent of spinal deformity. As previously stated, the deformity will be measured via the SRS/Schwab deformity classification system.The bracing system to be used is the Peak Scoliosis Bracing System (Aspen Medical Product Inc., Irvine, CA).||The data will be analyzed with a repeated measurement two-way ANOVA to determine differences between pre- and post-bracing measurements.

To draw valid conclusions about the effectiveness of postural specific physical exercise and brace therapeutic interventions compared to a self mediated activity exercise group, a randomized controlled trial research design will be used.||Preliminary data suggests that approximately 8 hours of night-time bracing with an over-corrective brace is as effective as bracing during 23 hours per day. Night-time bracing is attractive since you wear the brace a limited amount of time.||Several theories propose that during the adolescent period of skeletal growth, bone deformation may occur due to a combination of asymetrical growth plate activity, vertebral body weakness or an imbalance of muscle forces and joint flexibility. An association between low bone mineral density and idiopathic scoliosis has been reported in the literature. Adequate physical activity levels is a requirement for normal growth and development during childhood and adolescents. It is well documented that physical exercise is associated with improvements in not only muscle strength, aerobic fitness and motor development but also bone density which may help decrease the risk of osteopenic related bone deformation.||Patients included in the study will be randomized to one of three groups. Each of the three groups will receive a physical activity prescription according to World Health Organisation recommendations. One group will additionally wear a hyper-corrective night-time brace. One group will additionally perform postural scoliosis-specific exercises.

The use of growing rods in patients with progressive scoliosis requires several repeated surgeries (every 6 to 12 months) in order to follow the growth of children. These repeated surgeries lead to a significant increased risk of complications, that's why many teams around the world have been seeking solutions which allow to obtain a rod expansion without repeated surgery.||The purpose of our study is the evaluation of the use of medical device that will perform the correction of scoliosis and, at the same time, preserve the growth of the child's spine. In addition, the purpose of clinical investigation is to test the theory that distraction effort may be exercised without surgery thanks to traction manoeuvres and physiotherapy. This could allow to obtain in patients with progressive scoliosis, correction of spinal deformity while avoiding many repeated surgeries. Our reference device is growing rod ""NEMOST"". When implanted, NEMOST rod is immediately turned on, for correcting and maintaining the correction of spinal deformity. After implantation, depending on development in Cobb angle, one or more elongations can be made by sliding the notched portion of the rod in its tunnel by a distraction effort (traction equipments and physiotherapy).||Therefore, the growth device NEMOST will allow to continue, on request, the correction of spinal deformity by performing a distraction by external manoeuvres on the notched part without the need for surgery.",Scoliosis
NCT04421157,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a progressive growth disease with unknown etiology, characterized by a three-dimensional deformity of the spine (frontal translation, sagittal modification, and torsion of the spinous processes on the concave side of the scoliotic curve on radiographs).||In patients with AIS, in addition to curve progression there are many problems commonly occur such as; muscular imbalance, functional limitations, altered posture, gait deviations, reduced flexibility of the spine, back pain, negative physico-social, body image effects, and in severe cases pulmonary symptoms. The asymmetry of the trunk and pelvis are affected related to the shape and angle of scoliosis, and the weight distribution position changes depending on the shape and the Cobb angle of scoliosis. To deal with these complications and more, various treatment approaches have been proposed for AIS, including exercise, bracing, casting, traction, biofeedback, surgery, and simple observation to prevent, correct or halt the progression of the deformity. Conservative treatment methods including physiotherapy and bracing are accepted in Central Europe.||In literature, exercises are recommended to decrease progression, to improve spine and thoracic cage flexibility, muscle strengths, and elasticity, to correct postural behavior, and neuro-motor control, spine stability. In general, traditional exercises (TE) including postural training, stretching, and strengthening exercises for spinal musculature, respiratory exercises have been used for many years for scoliosis. Except for the traditional exercises, there are several exercise concepts including Schroth, Side Shift, Dobomed methods... etc. Schroth exercises are asymmetric scoliosis-specific postural exercises that aim to improve the curve, function, posture, self-image, and pain. Schroth exercises target strength and endurance training of the back, abdominal, and leg muscles. Also one of the aim of Schroth exercises is to improve motor control of the posture by repeating corrective movements with progressively less feedback. Schroth exercises are the most studied scoliosis exercises but there are limited randomized controlled studies on Schroth exercises.||Recently general physiotherapeutic exercises including, Core stabilization (CS) exercises, Pilates have been used in the conservative treatment of idiopathic scoliosis. CS exercises are described as therapy techniques that improve postural control, and functional stability through increasing neuromuscular control, the strength of trunk stabilization muscles, the endurance of postural muscles around the spine, the balance between pelvis and spine. However, limited studies are determining CS exercises' effect on patients with AIS. In a study CS exercises found to be more effective in reducing pain and rotational deformity than traditional exercises in the conservative rehabilitation of AIS.||A recent systematic review showed that therapeutic exercise had been effective to reduce symptoms, Cobb's angle, trunk rotation, craniovertebral angle, and body asymmetries, and to improve muscular endurance, pulmonary function, and functional capacity of patients with AIS. Corrective, therapeutic exercises appear to have positive effects by improving function and reducing symptoms, as well as various angles and body asymmetries. However, further studies with better methodological quality are required to confirm these outcomes and detect the best therapeutic exercise intervention. And also there is a need for randomized controlled studies on different methods of exercise to choose the most effective exercise in clinical practice.||There was no research compared to the effects of the Schroth method and CS exercises in patients with AIS. And also there was no research examining the effects of the Schroth method on peripheral muscle strengths. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the Schroth versus CS exercises in addition to traditional exercises, on Cobb angle, trunk rotation, peripheral muscle strengths, spine mobility, cosmetic deformity, and health-related quality of life in patients with AIS.",Scoliosis

NCT01610908,"Multicenter Schroth Exercise Trial for Scoliosis (SETS study) Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a progressive 3D deformity of the spine. It is the most common orthopedic condition in adolescents. Of those with curves larger than 10°, 90% are females. Scoliosis often results in chronic pain, poor posture, function, and self-image.||Curves greater than 30° are braced or later surgically corrected. In Europe but not the Americas, small curves (<30°) are treated with exercises to prevent the need for bracing and moderate curves with bracing and exercises to prevent surgery. Bracing is uncomfortable and patients fear surgery. In contrast, exercises are generally well received.||Schroth exercises are the most studied scoliosis exercises and have achieved very good outcomes. Schroth was the first exercise approach to offer formal certification training. No randomized controlled trial has focused on the Schroth method. Only 1 randomized controlled trial and only 3 prospective controlled studies with important methodological flaws were included in a recent review of the effect of all types of scoliosis exercises that found that exercises slowed the worsening of scoliosis. A randomized controlled trial on Schroth exercises is needed.||Schroth exercises are asymmetric scoliosis-specific postural exercises and aim to improve the curve, posture, pain, function, and self-image. Schroth exercises target endurance and strength training of the abdominal, back, and leg muscles.

NCT01776125,"NF 1 patients with scoliosis can present as either non dystrophic or dystrophic scoliosis. Non dystrophic scoliosis behaves and evolves similarly to that of AIS patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that Neurofibromatosis type 1 patients with non-dystrophic scoliosis have a similar curve progression risk profile markers as patients with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis. Dystrophic scoliosis patients will not have the same curve progression risk profile as AIS. The long range goal of this study is to possibly develop a genetic test in NF1 patients with scoliosis that is predictive of dystrophic or non-dystrophic type.

It will also aim to identify whether it is feasible to implement such a programme as part of a bigger RCT in the future based on the attendance rate and functional improvements.||Recruitment:||Participants will be identified and recruited pre-operatively through the spinal deformity waiting list. The Eligibility of participants can be obtained through their medical notes.||Once identified and confirmed as eligible, participants will be approached by one of the research nurses and invited to take part in the study. There are two potential pathways to recruitment:||If the participant is due to have a clinic appointment (such as a pre-operative assessment) within one month of their surgery, then patient information sheets and study invitation letters will be given to them at this appointment with their normal pre-operative information, by a research nurse. Follow up telephone calls can be conducted 7-10 days later to give participants and parents time to read and consider the information. Consent can be obtained at subsequent pre-operative appointments if any are scheduled (giving participants time to consider before consent), or at the time of admission for surgery should the participant want more time to consider.|If the patient has already completed their pre-operative assessment and is not due to attend for any further appointments prior to their surgery, they will be sent this information in the post. Participants will be given adequate time to read and consider the information given. This time scale has been set at 7-10 days, to give participants and their parents plenty of time to read the information and consider it before contacting them. A telephone call will then take place prior to their admission to ask whether they have read and had time to consider the information and whether they have any questions. If they would like to take part in the trial, then a research clinician will meet with them the day before their surgery, when they are admitted, in order to fill in the consent form and to fill in the baseline questionnaire.||Evidence of screening for all potential participants, whether recruited or not, should be kept and recorded.||Post-Operatively:||Following their surgery, a research clinician will visit the participant on the ward, approximately 3-4 days after their surgery. This is to check from the operation records that there has not been any surgical complications that would exclude them from the study, and to check that the participant and their parents are still happy to take part in the study. If so, the participant will be randomised by the research clinician at this point. Randomisation will be performed using sealed envelopes. The results of the randomisation will be given to the treating physiotherapist. Prior to the participants discharge home from the ward, the treating physiotherapist will inform the participant which group they have been allocated to. If they are in the intervention arm their outpatient physiotherapy appointments will be booked for them at this point. If they are randomised to the usual care arm, then the patient will be discharged from the ward and will not be required to attend for any further physiotherapy. All patients will have the same level of inpatient care on the ward prior to discharge home.||Intervention:||There are two arms to the trial and there will be 10 participants randomly allocated to each arm. The control group will be seen by the physiotherapist on the ward and given daily physiotherapy up until the point of discharge home. They will then not have any further physiotherapy follow up, as part of usual care, unless there are any post-operative complications that require a physiotherapy referral. If a participant in the control group is referred back into secondary care for physiotherapy during the trial, then this will be recorded as a deviation from the protocol and included in final analysis.||The intervention group involves the same inpatient care as the control arm, plus 12 sessions of physiotherapy as an outpatient, and this will start 6 week post-operatively. The participants will initially come once a week for 6 weeks. Then from 12 weeks post-operatively they will be required to come once every 2 weeks. The treatment will be pragmatic depending on the patients individual goals and needs, but will follow the accelerated rehabilitation protocol that has been agreed with the spinal deformity consultant surgeons. Once the participants in the intervention arm have completed their 12 sessions, they will be discharged from physiotherapy for self-management, unless they have any on-going physiotherapy related needs. In this case they can continue with physiotherapy and it will be recorded as a deviation from the protocol.||Data Collection and Follow Up:||All 20 participants will fill in a baseline data collection booklet at the time of consent, which is just before their surgery.

NCT00842218,"Introduction X-ray studies and three-dimensional analysis in standing showed that this Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis was characterised by stiffness of the affected vertebral levels [3, 7, 10] with decreased segmental mobilities. The impact of this stiffness was studied during functional activity such as walking to quantify the functional dynamic consequences. During gait, thoracic AIS provided an asymmetrical trunk rotation with a lack of rotation on the convex side [8] and an excessive paravertebral muscular bilateral activity [11]. These studies included only moderate scoliosis. There were no studies approaching the effects of the severity of the scoliosis curves on gait parameters.||We hypothesize first that, the spinal deformations in AIS, producing a stiffness of the trunk, pelvic and hip motions, will deteriorate the gait by reducing the segmental mobilities, increasing the mechanical work and the energy cost and second that the severity of the frontal curves will be more damaging on this parameters. To this end, we hope to gain valuable insight as to the functional effects of the scoliosis aggravation from a more dynamic perspective.||Material Fifty-four female adolescents will be included in the study. This sample consists in two groups: healthy girls and girls with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (divided in 3 subgroups according to the Cobb angle range) [9].||A standard full spine XRay assessment will be performed to measure the Cobb angle curve, the frontal body balance, the apical vertebral rotation [13].||Gait will be assessed by a three-dimensional analysis, including synchronous kinematic [4], electromyographic (EMG) [14], mechanic [5, 6, 15] and energetic measurements [1, 2, 12].||The sessions begins with a rest period, in which the subjects stand barefoot on the motor driven treadmill for the static calibration of kinematic and energetic variables.

NCT03298256,"Scoliosis is a 3D deformity of the spine with curvatures occurring in three planes.||The efficacy of bracing in correcting the frontal deformity is now well-accepted after the Bracing in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Trial (BRAIST). Restoration of the sagittal alignment is one of the fundamental goals in scoliosis treatment. The investigators have previously demonstrated on fulcrum bending radiographs that there is coupling between the frontal deformity, thoracic kyphosis and apical vertebral derotation. The investigators' findings suggest that there may be natural coupling of the frontal and sagittal deformities towards ""self-normalisation"" during correction of the curves. The effect of bracing on the sagittal alignment and 3D deformity in scoliosis is currently not well-understood. If there is a tendency for the natural curve behaviour to return towards a more normal sagittal alignment, then bracing may exert a similar effect on the 3D profile. Understanding how the 3D deformity is affected by bracing allows further insight into curve progression and brace effectiveness.||Few studies in the literature have addressed the sagittal profile and 3D correction by bracing. Of those, the findings were based on vertebral reconstructions obtained from CT-scan, finite element analysis modelling, or studying the changes in the rib cage rotation. However, the investigators propose to measure the 3D profile using the modern EOS ® system, which allows biplanar radiography and 3D calculations and a more accurate measurement of vertebral wedging.",Scoliosis

Without treatment, skeletally immature children with idiopathic curves of 20°-40° risk curve progression. Treatment of these patients is focused on either observation or bracing. Although bracing has been shown to be more effective than observation, success is contingent on patient adherence and has the potential for further optimization with adjunct therapies.||Little research is available concerning adjunct therapies that may be used during bracing of AIS patients. One therapy in particular, abobotulinumtoxinA (BTX) injection, has been poorly studied. Injection of BTX into the paraspinal musculature of the concave aspect of the major curve may result in a more malleable curve and thus optimize brace treatment. If BTX injections are found to improve outcomes in this way, a new standard of nonoperative care could be established for AIS patients, potentially reducing the number of patients who undergo surgery.||The aim of this study is to assess whether BTX injections (administered as Dysport® (Ipsen Pharmaceuticals)) in the paraspinal musculature at the site of the major scoliotic curve decrease curve progression in skeletally immature AIS patients who are concurrently treated with bracing.

NCT04382638,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), a three-dimensional (3D) deformity of the spinal column characterized by lateral deviation and vertebral rotation, affects 3.5% of children during puberty in Hong Kong. Untreated scoliosis continues to deteriorate beyond adolescence, and curves that progress beyond 50 degrees can lead to chronic back pain, cardiopulmonary compromise, poor cosmesis and negative psychological impact. Hence, surgical correction of the deformity by instrumented spinal fusion is recommended when curves reach 50 degrees. Although surgical risks have decreased with improved techniques, surgeries for scoliosis correction still carry significant medical co-morbidities, psychological stress to the children and their families, and substantial financial burden on healthcare. Effective non-operative strategies to prevent curve progression during adolescence are needed. Currently, the most effective non-operative treatment supported by high quality randomised controlled trial to prevent curve progression is by spinal bracing. In the Bracing in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Trial (BrAIST) study, bracing was effective in preventing curve progression to threshold for surgery in 72% of cases. The failure rate, therefore, remains substantially high despite the best available non-operative treatment. Previous studies have identified factors affecting brace success, including skeletal age, curve type, curve magnitude, and flexibility, but none of these is modifiable. Brace treatment requires a wholistic approach, and brace design and fabrication are important determinants of brace effectiveness. Traditional Boston-style thoracolumbosacral orthoses (TLSO), such as those used in the BrAIST study, can achieve in-brace coronal curve correction reliably but their effects on the 3D curve correction are highly variable. Since AIS is a 3D deformity, it is reasonable to postulate that braces which can achieve correction in all three planes have a higher chance of success.||Rigo Chêneau orthoses (RCO) were developed approximately two decades ago by Dr. Manuel Rigo of Barcelona who made improvements to the Chêneau brace that French doctor Jacques Chêneau invented in 1978. RCO was designed with the intent to combine biomechanical forces in three dimensions, including curve derotation. They use an open pelvis design with anterior opening. Instead of focusing on one-dimensional correction, RCO treats scoliosis in all three dimensions and follows a unique curve Rigo classification protocol to guide brace design. RCO not only keeps the curves from getting worse as seen on an X-ray, but also corrects as much as possible the way the body looks. Every attempt is made to decrease the noticeable effects of scoliosis such as rib humps, uneven shoulders, hips which are translated or rotated, and centering the head over the pelvis. To achieve successful 3D scoliosis correction, in-brace Cobb angle correction must be 50% to be considered acceptable. This is often true and it is also true that the Cobb angle, which is easily assessed, has been the gold standard of measurement for brace quality. However, not all patients can and/or should be corrected to 50% in-brace correction. In some cases, a 25% in-brace correction coupled with good 3D correction is acceptable and sufficient to prevent scoliosis progression, when greater Cobb angle correction would cause negative compensations. Overall, some patients are best served by targeting a low in-brace correction, whereas for others an 80% in-brace correction is both achievable and desirable.",Scoliosis
NCT03641469,"The Green Sun Medical Dynamic Brace (GSM) brace was developed as an alternative to rigid thoracolumbosacral orthoses (TLSOs, braces) commonly used to prevent continued curve progression in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). The brace applies corrective forces to the muscular and bony structures of the spine while preserving range of motion (ROM). The orthosis is prefabricated and adjusted for each patient. A series of semi-rigid segments encircle the patient's torso in close contact and are joined by a structure of flexible elements. These flexible (or elastic) elements generate stabilizing forces, providing the necessary immobilization while allowing relative motion of the semi-rigid segments. To date, this brace has been tested in the lab on healthy volunteers.||This study will recruit patients currently using a TLSO and compare the curve correction achieved in the GSM brace to that in their current brace. After 3 months in the GSM brace, the out-of-brace Cobb angle will be measured and compared to that at enrollment. Safety will be continually assessed. Brace-related quality of life (comfort, stress, interference with activities) will be self-reported. Adherence to the brace prescription will be measured using an in-brace temperature monitor.",Scoliosis
NCT02434003,"By identifying the patients for whom the model predicts a significant progression the investigators could focus their efforts on being more pro-active towards brace wear for those at risk of progression. With the advent of new growth modulation techniques, these patients could also potentially receive early management of their curves to prevent further progression and diminish the need for surgical correction and fusion of their curve. Alternatively, by identifying the patients that will not progress immediately at the first visit, the investigators could arguably decrease their number needed to treat from 4 to 2 by removing those patients that won't progress no matter what their treatment is. So, the prediction model will not only have an impact for the patients at risk of progression but will also impact those that are braced despite having a low risk of progression.||Patient enrollment:||Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be offered enrollment in the project. If the family wishes to enroll in the project, the informed consent process will be undertaken and the patient will be enrolled.||If Patients need to be treated with brace No changes in the usual treatment and monitoring will be instituted. Therefore, patients will be allowed to undergo brace treatment. The investigators are aware that brace treatment could have an impact on curve progression but these patients are still included as progression despite brace treatment may give meaningful information regarding these difficult-to-treat curves. Patient under brace treatment will have to remove brace at least the night before their appointment and follow-up spine radiographs. Also the protocol requires that patients have at least one spine radiograph out of brace every 12 months. Bracing compliance will be evaluated as a specific covariable in the upcoming study. To better understand the impact of bracing on progression, the investigators will be using brace monitors, pressure sensitive transducers that can monitor brace wear and brace effectiveness, in their multicenter study and use the data generated by these monitors as a co-factor in an improved prediction model.||If patients need to have surgery Although patients showing sufficient curve progression to undergo surgical correction will not be kept in the prospective cohort after surgery, their data will still be analyzed to assess the correlation between local 3-D measurements and curve progression.||-Data collection||Data collected at first visit will include:||Demographic data|past medical history|gender|body-mass index (weight and height)|family history|sexual maturity (start of menses for girls)|rib prominence|initial radiographic evaluation. Data collected at each follow-up visit (ideally every 6 months)|body-mass index (weight and height)|menarchal status,|skeletal maturity|rib prominence.||Radiographic evaluation (at least every 12 months during the study period, without brace).||Image acquisition and transfer to central measurement site. Image acquisition is standardized between sites according to standard operating procedures. All images are acquired with the EOS™ system in the same fashion based on the position proposed by Horton et al. that standardized lateral radiographs by using a hand-on-clavicle position. The radiographs are all taken in the same way thus minimizing variability. For the centers without an EOS™ system for part or for the entire study, utilization of calibration belts will allow radiographs to be taken in a calibrated environment. The position used for image acquisition is the same as for the EOS™ system.|Three-dimensional reconstructions of the spine The stereo radiographic images are used to create an external three-dimensional representation of the vertebral body using a specific algorithm. First, a spline is fitted through the centers of the vertebral bodies both on the PA and lateral views. The information from both images is then used to reconstruct a 3-D spline or curve which will act as a rough three-dimensional scaffold onto which the local vertebral and intervertebral reconstructions will take place. The vertebral endplates are represented by a crude preliminary model of the spine by using a set of cubic templates roughly representing each vertebral body stacked on top of one another to form the spinal column. A global configuration of the deformable spine model is thus described for each cubic template associated with each vertebral level. The final reconstruction can then be completed using a priori knowledge from a database of scoliotic and normal vertebrae that were measured by the investigator's research group. The a priori knowledge model relies on the description of each vertebra by a deformable model, which incorporates statistical knowledge about its geometrical structure and its pathological variability. The statistically optimized reconstructions will be used to determine the intervertebral disk shape at each level.|Three-dimensional stereoradiographic reconstructions of the pelvis||The pelvis will be reconstructed in 3-D for all normal and AIS subjects using a combination of the Non-Stereo Corresponding Points (NSCP) and Non-Stereo Corresponding Contours (NSCC) methods, which were successfully by the investigator's team to reconstruct the spine in 3D. Preliminary evaluation of the technique gave an overall accuracy of 1,6 mm, which is adequate for the calculation of clinical geometric indices of the pelvis. Four steps are required with this 3D reconstruction technique:||Identification of seven specific regions of the pelvis;|Display of a preliminary model with 45 control points. The control points can be modified in real time by the user (NSCP);|Interactive identification of regional contours (NSCC);||Generation of the personalized 3D pelvic model by deforming a generic 3D pelvic model using 3D geometrical kriging.||Local three-dimensional measurements of the vertebrae and disks:||The calculated parameters were divided into six categories. Each category refers to global (whole spine), regional (scoliotic segment) and local (vertebra) descriptors. Vertebra centroid is understood as the halfway point between the centers of the two endplates of the vertebra. The local vertebra axis system is defined by the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) 3D terminology group: the origin is at the centroid of the vertebral body, the local 'z' axis passes through the centers of the upper and lower endplates, and 'y' axis is parallel to a line joining similar landmarks on the bases of the right and left pedicles.||Cobb Angles: Cobb angles defined as the angle between the upper and lower endplate of the respective end vertebrae of a curve. Cobb angle was measured in the frontal plane, in the plane of maximal deformation in 3D and in the sagittal plane for thoracic kyphosis (T4-T12) and lumbar lordosis (L1-S1).|Plane of maximal deformation: Axial angle of the plane in which the Cobb angle is maximal.|Three-dimensional wedging of vertebral body and disk: Wedging of the apical vertebral body in the plane of maximal deformation (3D plane) and mean maximal 3D wedging of the two apical intervertebral disks. Maximal 3D wedging represents the wedging measured in the plane, wherein the wedging value is maximal around the vertical axis. If apex was a disk, then the mean of the 3D wedging of both apical vertebral bodies was calculated and only the 3D wedging of the apical disk was documented. 3D disk wedging was analyzed for all levels of the spine (from T1-T2 to L4-L5).|Axial intervertebral rotation of the apex, upper and lower junctional level and thoracolumbar level: Rotation between two adjacent vertebrae at upper, apical, and lower curve levels and thoracolumbar junction (T12-L1) in the axial plane according to the inferior local vertebrae reference.|Torsion: Mean of the sum of intervertebral axial rotation (measured according to the local referential of the inferior vertebrae) of the two hemicurvatures of the curve (between upper end vertebra and apex and between lower end vertebra and apex).||Slenderness (local T6, T12 and L4 and regional T1-L5): Ratio between the height (distance between the superior and inferior endplates at the center of the vertebrae) and the width (measured at the center of the vertebrae using a line perpendicular to the height line in medio lateral direction) of the vertebral body for T6, T12 and L4 vertebrae. Ratio between the length of the spine from T1 to L5 and the mean of the width of vertebral bodies of T6-T12 and L4. The same measurement was made by replacing the width by the depth (a line perpendicular to the height line at the center of the vertebra in an anteroposterior direction).||Geometric pelvic indices:||Geometric pelvic indices will be calculated automatically with the generation of the 3D pelvic model. Indices describing the orientation of the pelvis in 3D (positional indices), based on the line joining the center of both femoral heads (hip axis), will be calculated first. Pelvic axial rotation is the orientation of the hip axis around the vertical axis (gravity line) as viewed in the transverse plane. Pelvic obliquity is the orientation of the hip axis around the horizontal line as viewed from the coronal plane. Pelvic tilt is the orientation of the pelvis around the medio-lateral axis of the pelvis as viewed from the sagittal plane. In this last case, at least another landmark from the pelvis (such as the center of the upper sacral plate) needs to be identified in addition to the hip axis. The sacral slope (angle between the upper sacral plate and the horizontal line is also calculated since it is highly correlated with lumbar lordosis. Sacral obliquity is the angle between the upper sacral plate and the horizontal line. Morphological indices of the pelvis (not dependent on the patient's position) are computed in a reference coordinate system based on the hip axis orientation, in order to eliminate the effect of pelvic axial rotation and obliquity. This means that transformation into the reference coordinate system allows calculation of morphological indices in the true coronal, axial and sagittal planes of the pelvis. The investigators selected the pelvis as their reference system based on the pelvic vertebra principle from Dubousset, which states that the pelvis can be viewed as a separate vertebra. As described earlier, numerous morphologic parameters of the pelvis have been used in the past, as detailed in Tables I to III. Of these, after a thorough review of the literature, the investigators selected what they consider the 7 most pertinent specific indices. The investigators based their decision on the potential association of the pelvic indices with the pathogenesis of AIS. Since they demonstrated the close relationship between pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis in AIS, the investigators selected morphological indices of the pelvis that are correlated with the spine geometry.",Scoliosis

NCT02643290,"Background: Some adult scoliosis patients suffer significant back pain and risk increased curvature leading to postural collapse. The main approach for these patients according to the current literature is the surgical one, however, surgery is not without complications, is not appropriate for all patients and certain patients do not choose to undergo surgery. Despite the fact that scoliosis has been estimated to affect up to 68% of the population over 60, there is scant literature about conservative treatments for adult scoliosis; a case report and a case series demonstrated the effectiveness of scoliosis specific exercise to stop progression, while another study reported the effectiveness of a soft brace in reducing pain at short time. Custom fabricated rigid torso braces, similar to those commonly used for children are sometimes used in adult patients, however, the goal of these braces is to correct and/or sustain the sagittal plane of patients, no data have been published on the efficacy of these braces in relief of pain, and such braces are typically not well tolerated by adults.

NCT04441411,"Scoliosis is a complex three-dimensional deformity of the spine, which occurs primarily in growing children and adolescents. In adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), the cause is unknown. Children with severe and progressive scoliosis, if left untreated, are at risk of rapid and severe spinal deformity progression, which can result in a decrease of pulmonary function, poor cosmetic result and poor quality of life.||Treatment options in AIS depend on curve severity and remaining growth potential, and include intensive brace treatment for smaller curvatures whereas surgical correction and spinal fusion is advocated for more severe curves. Growing rods are used for severe early infantile deformities or early onset scoliosis (EOS).||Bracing, by using a rigid plastic orthosis, is currently the primary therapy to prevent curve progression in mild curves up to 45 degrees and skeletal immature patients. Most braces are recommended to be worn for 18-23 hours per day during several years (until skeletal maturity has been reached). This may cause a high level of physical discomfort and emotional and psychological stress in these patients, and failure of brace treatment therefore is common.||Surgical therapy for AIS is recommended in severe progressive curvatures. Surgical treatment includes correction of the spinal curvature by using multisegmental screw fixation and posterior spinal fusion of the thoracolumbar spine.

NCT04688437,"The sagittal alignment of the spine, or sagittal balance, describe the ideal and normal sagittal spinal curvature distribution. With the deepening of the research on spinal morphology, function and pathology, more and more researchers pay attention to the role of sagittal alignment in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal deformity diseases. Some studies have shown that the restoration of patients with appropriate sagittal alignment can significantly improve their quality of life. Besides, paravertebral muscle can also influence the retaining of sagittal alignment. However, how to define the ideal sagittal alignment is still controversial for different patients with adult degenerative scoliosis(ADS) .||It was proved that the differences in sagittal parameters of the standing and sitting positions positions were influenced by age, gender and pelvic incidence(PI). In addition, patients with high PI are more prone to sagittal decompensation after long segment fixation (fixation of three or more segments) .Therefore, We speculate that the sagittal curvature of patients with large PI changes greatly from standing position to sitting position. So after long segment fixation, the spine in the state of standing position is more difficult to adapt to the changes of curvature and stress in sitting position, which is the possible reason that patients with high PI are more prone to sagittal decompensation. At present, how to design the proper corrective goals for patients according to both sagittal alignment and paravertebral muscle needs further research.||Thus, this study is aim to explore these three points about ADS patients: the characteristics of the sagittal spinal alignment changes from standing to sitting ; the adaption of the spine curvature in the standing and sitting position after long segment fixation surgery and the relationship among standing-sitting sagittal spinal alignment, paravertebral muscle and postoperative clinical outcomes.",Scoliosis

NCT03862417,"1.1 Adult degenerative scoliosis. Scoliosis is a 3D spine deformity including frontal curves, vertebral rotations, and sagittal changes.1 A curve >10o after 18 years of age is called Adult Scoliosis (AS) and is the most common adult spinal deformity.2 Degenerative AS arises from asymmetric disc and facet degeneration or due to leg length discrepancy, hip pathology, and osteoporosis.3 Most AS curves are lumbar or thoracolumbar.4 The prevalence of degenerative AS is higher than adolescent scoliosis, but estimates range widely at 2.4% - 68%56. The prevalence of curves >20° is 24%.7||AS causes pain, curve progression, radiculopathy, or cosmetic deformity affecting quality of life and physical function8-10. Pain affects 90% of patients with AS9. Adults with degenerative scoliosis present more pain than with idiopathic scoliosis.3 Severe radiculopathy (47%), claudication (9%), weakness (8%), myelopathy, and bowel/bladder dysfunction(1%) are also more common in adults with scoliosis.11 Sagittal imbalance in AS is strongly correlated with disability and low quality of life.12 Curve progression is common in AS at 2-6o/yr.13 It is thus relevant to offer treatments to prevent curve progression and the signs and symptoms above.||1.2 What treatment is available? There is an important lack of evidence about non-operative treatments for AS despite the recommendation of non-operative treatments are the first line for treating AS.8,14,15 This suggestion arise mostly because of the high complications rates with surgery and poor bone quality8. However, exercise has generally not been offered in studies comparing non-operative to operative care.8,14,15 The main goal of rehabilitation in AS is to decrease pain, improve function and slow disease progression to avoid surgery.16,17 Our review on exercises for AS18 found only one study with high risk of bias showing that 20 weeks of scoliosis specific exercises compared to general physiotherapy led to significantly more improved pain (by 3.2/10 pts), SRS-22 quality of life (by 0.7/5 for function, 0.9 pain, 0.5 self-image, 0.7 mental health and 1.0 for satisfaction with care), and Oswestry disability (by 12%). Only adults with idiopathic scoliosis were included in this study19 and exercises have not yet been tested in adults with degenerative scoliosis.||1.3 Rationale for Schroth treatment: Our award winning work with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis suggests that pain, self-image and back muscle endurance improvements, as well as, reduced curve progression result from short exercise programs.20-22 Schroth is a 3D autocorrection exercise aiming to correct posture.23 Schroth exercises are not yet routinely used for adults in Edmonton, but surgeons and patients have expressed interest for evidence on exercise. Patients routinely seek treatment options for smaller curvatures and inquire about less invasive treatments than surgery.||1.4 Schroth treatment: Posture corrections are achieved with the use of pressure, mirror and therapist verbal and tactile feedback.24,25 Schroth exercises aim to improve the ability to maintain correct posture through endurance and strength training.22 Schroth exercises include de-rotation, side shifting, and stretching to establish vertebral alignment, torsion respiratory exercises, and strengthening for postural muscles.26||2. Specific Aims: To conduct a pilot study for an RCT on the effect of Schroth exercises in adults with degenerative scoliosis compared to observation. Specific goals of the pilot are to: 2.1) Determine the recruitment and eligibility rate of patients for the RCT; 2.2) Demonstrate the feasibility of the assessment and treatment protocol by showing a high percent compliance with program attendance and home exercises and low study dropout rate; and 2.3) Estimate the effect size and variability for all outcomes to determine the sample size for the proposed RCT.||3. Methods and Materials||3.1 Subjects: Adults over 50 years old with degenerative scoliosis (n=20) with pain (>2/10) will be recruited from referrals to Dr. Eric Huang and James Mahood and using community ads. Other inclusion criteria are: (1) curves 15°-45°. Curves over 50° are surgical candidates, and will be excluded. Patients who have had cortisone or anesthetic injections within the last 3 months, surgery or presenting contra-indications to exercises (fractures, cancer, severe cardio-vascular co-morbidities, or osteopenia) will be excluded.||3.2 Procedures: Patients will be invited to participate at the Drs' clinics. Participants will be randomized to the observation (control) group or the Schroth exercise treatment group using REDCAP. All outcomes will be measured at baseline and at a 3-month follow-up. Longer term effects will be assessed 3 months after the exercise program. The primary outcome is pain at 3 months controlling for medication use.27 Secondary outcomes include: spine curve angles, vertebral rotation, SRS-22 questionnaire (self-image, mental health, function, and pain and total scores), posture (Surface Topography), Global Rating of Change (GRC), Oswestry Disability index, and muscle endurance (Sorensen test). At baseline, a physical exam will ensure participants can exercise safely. The control group will be under observation for 3 months. The Schroth group will participate in weekly supervised sessions and a daily home program for 3 months. After 3 months, controls will undergo the same exercise protocol. This will allow examining exercise effects using these patients as their own controls and improve willingness for randomization.||3.3.1 Schroth exercises treatment: During the first 2 weeks, participants will attend 5 1-hr long individual sessions to learn Schroth exercises and the home program, and to confirm independent adequate performance with a checklist.28 A 30-min. daily home program of 3 to 4 exercises will be prescribed and progressed by the certified Schroth therapist throughout the project using an algorithm26. Compliance will be monitored weekly using a logbook. Patients will attend weekly 1-hr long group therapist-led exercise classes for 3 months. Classes increase compliance and sense of social support.29,30 At each group class, adequate exercise performance will be assessed using the checklist.28 An algorithm guides the prescription of exercises intensity and progression from static to dynamic depending on the participant's ability.28 Prescription begins with Sitting on a Ball. If performed adequately, a more challenging exercise is attempted. If performance is not adequate, an easier exercise is attempted. The 3 most challenging exercises performed adequately as per the checklist will be prescribed with a detailed handout.28||3.3.2 Control intervention: Observation without treatment or with previously prescribed pain medication is the current standard for adults with degenerative scoliosis not planning surgery.||3.4 Co-interventions, contamination monitoring: Pain medication use will be monitored by a single score using the validated Medication Quantification Scale.27 Participants will be asked to refrain from using co-interventions. Co-intervention use will be monitored as well as any contamination where controls may attempt Schroth treatment.||3.5 Assessment: Evaluators will be blinded to group allocation and patients reminded not to divulge.||3.5.1 Self-Report Questionnaires: Demographic/History- Socio-demographics, medical history, symptoms and modifying factors will be self-reported at baseline only to describe participants.||Numeric Pain Rating and diagram- (Primary outcome). A scale from 0 to 10 (worst imaginable pain) will assess current, best, worst pain intensity in the last 24 hours, with documented reliability and validity.31 A body pain diagram will categorize the location of symptoms with high reliability.32||The Scoliosis Research Society (SRS-22r) is a quality of life questionnaire with 22 questions assessing 5 domains: function, pain, self-image, mental health (5 questions each), and satisfaction (2 questions).33 Scores correspond to the average of the items. The SRS-22 has adequate test-retest reliability, and validity with good correlations with SF-36, SF-12, and Oswestry scores.34||The Oswestry disability questionnaire assesses back related disability (/100 important disability) using 10 questions. The Oswestry is recommended in the core set in spinal research and presents adequate reliability, validity and responsiveness.35,36||Global Rating of Change- A 15-point global rating scale,35,37 will only be used at each follow-up. The scale ranges from -7 (very great deal worse) to +7 (very great deal better).||3.5.2 Physical Exam: A physiotherapist blind to group assignment, will determine curve type28 and assess the range of motion for lower extremities, leg length (supine) and asymmetry in the forward bend test (with scoliometer).38,39 Lumbar and thoracic spinal range-of-motion will be recorded using double inclinometers: flexion, extension and side flexions. The Sorensen's test will assess back extensor endurance as the time the torso is maintained horizontal against gravity.40||3.5.3 3D ultrasound imaging- Standing 3D Ultrasound scans of the spine will be obtained without radiation exposure in a positioning frame. An experienced evaluator will extract curve angle, and apical vertebra rotations from de-identified images with high reliability and interchangeability with radiographs measurements has been shown.41-44||3.5.4 Full-torso surface topography (ST) - Four Minolta 910 Laser Scanners and a positioning frame will be used to record full-torso ST scans. The operator will acquire scans blind to treatment groupings. The operator will position the subjects, mark reference points, and scan. ST parameters will be extracted in Matlab by digitizing 15 reference points on de-identified scans. The parameters quantifying the external trunk deformity are: cosmetic score composed of a weighted average of the shoulder angle, scapula angle and waist asymmetry, the trunk twist, and kyphotic and lumbar indices and angles from the sagittal view.45,46 We found parameters have adequate discriminative validity and sensitivity to change.47 Asymmetry maps will also be monitored.48-50||3.6. Analyses: Objective 1: Recruitment rates will be calculated as the percent of patients enrolled out of all patients invited. Eligibility rate corresponds to the percentage of patients meeting the selection criteria out of all patients assessed at clinics. Objective 2: Compliance will be calculated as the percentage of visits attended and percent prescribed home exercises reported performed. Drop-out rate will be calculated as the percentage of enrolled patients not completing the study. Objective 3: Cohen's D effect sizes and sample size needed will be estimated for all outcomes51,52 targeting a power of 0.80 with alpha of 0.05 using the observed change and variability from intention-to-treat analyses. Where available MCID will inform sample size estimation.||4. Significance: Adult degenerative scoliosis is a chronic and often painful condition, with a profound effect on patients.3,53 The Schroth exercise method is less invasive than current treatments (injections, surgery). Our review suggest that exercises can be effective to limit pain, disability and other deficits.18 RCTs on Schroth exercises for AS are needed.

NCT03194568,"Scoliosis is a condition in which the spine is deformed by a curvature in the coronal plane. It is generally associated with a twisting (axial plane) deformity as well. It can have a variety of underlying etiologies and the etiology is used to classify the types of scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis is sub-classified in two ways: by age of onset and by magnitude of deformity. Curves between 10 and 25 degrees are considered mild. Curves between 25 and 50 degrees are classified as moderate. Curves greater than 50 degrees are termed severe. The current standard of care for moderate scoliosis in patients with remaining growth is to utilize a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO brace) to prevent progression of deformity. The scientific evidence has supported the efficacy of this intervention in avoiding progression of the Cobb angle to 50 degrees or more.||If treated with a TLSO brace, many idiopathic scoliosis patients would conceivably be subjected to years of brace wear and the cost and psychological factors inherent therein. Additional downsides of brace treatment include the potentially negative psychosocial impact of wearing an external sign of deformity during adolescence, a key period of emotional development. Prior research has identified negative psychosocial effects related to wearing a brace in children.||Recent evidence has suggested that certain curve patterns will likely progress to 50 degrees or more, despite treatment with a TLSO brace. Sanders, et al. demonstrated a correlation of Cobb angle (greater than 35 degrees) and skeletal maturity (bone age 4 or less) to the risk of progression to 50 degrees or more, despite TLSO bracing. The evidence supports that the current practice of TLSO bracing is not an effective treatment to avoid progression to 50 degrees in these patients. It is on this population (thoracic Cobb angle greater than 35 degrees, bone age of 4 or less) that we intend to test the safety and feasibility of Anterior Vertebral Body Tethering to avoid curve progression to 50 degrees.||The study intervention is surgical orthopedic implantation of the Anterior Vertebral Tether Device, by way of thoracoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. The primary outcome measures include assessments of safety of the insertion procedure and of the device, as well as the secondary measure of feasibility by determining the ability to successfully implant the investigational device.",Scoliosis
NCT04117334,"Bracing is the mainstay treatment for preventing adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) progression and the main purpose for treatment is to prevent deformities from reaching the surgical threshold. It has been shown to be effective at reducing curve progression especially in patients with good compliance to treatment. However, bracing should not be used indiscriminately as certain complications have been reported. Bracing too early is safe for curve control but may subject children to prolonged discomfort with the bracing and increased consumption of resources for periodic brace fabrication. Prolonged bracing also reduces spinal mobility, lead to poor body image and self-esteem, and worsen quality of life. Additional risks of osteoporosis and muscular atrophy may also occur. Hence, being able to initiate prompt and appropriate bracing is crucial for achieving optimal curve control and avoiding complications.||Yet, there are still have difficulties identifying patients who may deteriorate. Generally speaking, skeletally immature AIS patients with curves of 20-40 degrees should consider bracing. However, not all of these patients require bracing and some may not need any treatment. More importantly, the resulting curve magnitude on radiographs may not correlate directly with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures. As such, the relationship of the Cobb angle prior to initiating brace treatment with long-term HRQOL measures is unknown. The above suggest that there is a significant gap in our knowledge of the optimal timing of brace initiation for managing AIS patients.||In the current setting of rising health-care expenditures, it is also important to assess the ""value"" of management options and provide the best and cost-effective care for our AIS patients without compromising outcomes or safety. Some clinicians may be more aggressive by bracing children with minor curves while some are content with prescribing braces only when deterioration occurs in moderate curves. In this modern era of healthcare, there is increasing emphasis placed on monitoring and controlling health-care costs to the patient, hospital and insurance companies. Hence, it is an appropriate time to consider the relationship of cost-effectiveness factors and HRQOL measures in designing bracing protocols for AIS patients. With increasing health-care costs, consumption of resources, and the imperative to provide the best healthcare to these children, and focus on a cost-effective delivery of care.||It is thus timely for us to perform this prospective cost-effectiveness comparative study to identify the best indications for initiating brace treatment for AIS patients. Evidence for the best HRQOL outcomes at the lowest cost from both the patient and health-care perspective is necessary to further improve the care for AIS patients. There is potential for the derived model to be applied in other healthcare systems by using a more personalized approach.||For this study, the investigators will utilize mathematical modeling based on factors including initial Cobb angle, maturity status, brace duration, and HRQOL measures to determine the best cost-effective indications for brace treatment. Outcomes will be dependent on the Cobb angle at the end of bracing, HRQOL measures and the overall costs incurred to patients and infrastructure. Our hypothesis is given an AIS patient with significant growth potential, a Cobb angle of 25 degrees is most cost-effective for initiating bracing. On the contrary, bracing for subjects with Cobb angles of 40 degrees or more is not cost-effective regardless of remaining growth.||The main objectives of this study are:||To assess the cost-effectiveness of current bracing protocols for AIS.|To create a mathematical model that will determine the most cost-effective threshold for initiating brace treatment based on health quality of life measures.||This is a prospective comparative cost-effectiveness analysis between bracing groups. This study will be carried out at the Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital (DKCH). Prospective collection of data from AIS patients including clinical and radiographic information. The investigators will only include AIS patients seen in the first setting with remaining growth potential (Risser 0-2) that may be considered for bracing, and will be prescribed with either underarm (Boston) or Milwaukee bracing. The investigators will collect a minimum of two-year longitudinal data, having at least 5 follow-up data points or clinic visits. It is clinic protocol that all subjects undergo weight, height and arm span measurements, radiographs and doctor assessments at these visits. For this study, HRQOL and utility measurements are vital to its success. Thus, the SRS-22r and EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be provided at every visit. Three subgroups for analysis between groups. For groups of baseline Cobb angles (20-<35, 35-40, >40 degrees)||Direct and indirect cost will be analyzed. The medical cost (direct costs) for each patient since the first presentation will be obtained. The cost includes the expenses for clinic follow-up, any form of outpatient and inpatient treatment (including physiotherapy, scoliosis specific exercises, bracing) and complications. Unit cost of investigation, treatment and follow-up will be based on the Hospital Authority official charges to non-eligible persons available in the 2013 Hong Kong Government Gazette and updated charges in Hospital Authority website. Brace costs include the number of orthotic visits, per visit consultation cost for the orthotist fabrication of the brace, consumables for use, number of exchanges or modifications, and the thermal sensor for monitoring compliance. In addition to the orthotist, other allied health professionals are also part of the bracing program which further increases the cost. Physiotherapists are involved to maintain body posture and teach/perform scoliosis specific exercises. A clinical psychologist will periodically assess the patient and family to maintain mental health. will be included in the cost analysis. For subjects with failed conservative treatment meaning progression of the curve and no longer indicated for bracing or further bracing will undergo surgical intervention. These subjects are still analyzed but an addition cost item of ""surgery"" (one lump-sum to cover general cost of implants, hospital length of stay, operating theater cost) will be included. The cost of family members missing work (indirect costs) will also be assessed.||Cost-effectiveness analysis of initiating for bracing will be performed via Markov modelling that will simulate the clinical management of AIS patients since first presentation assuming at age of 11 years (female). Each patient starting at the assumed age 11 will thus follow an annual cycle with a time horizon until 18 years of age. Modelling will be carried out for the AIS patients as a whole, and by the 5 Cobb angle magnitude groups (20-25 degrees, >25-30 degrees, >30-35 degrees, >35-40 degrees, and >40 degrees). For each cycle year, patients initiating bracing may wear the brace until maturity, stop wearing (compliance rate), or switch to surgical approach over the years. Patients with failed bracing will proceed to surgery, and stay with a post-operation health status from operation date to the end. Costs and utility data for AIS patients initiating bracing will be obtained from above prospective study. Clinical model parameters related to compliance rate of bracing, maturity rate of bracing, probability of treatment switch from bracing to surgery will also be identified through a comprehensive review of local and overseas literature as reference. Based on the regression model found, the investigators will estimate the effects of bracing at variable initial curvature and maturity status on direct and indirect costs, SRS-22r domain and total scores, and EQ-5D utility scores. The cost-effectiveness analysis will also recommend a threshold of curvature and maturity combination to indicate when bracing initiated will be the most cost-effective or even cost-saving treatment option for AIS patients.",Scoliosis
NCT03330158,"Despite a better understanding and technical progress, the evolutionary early scoliosis remains a therapeutic challenge. The definition includes idiopathic scoliosis beginning before the age of 3 years, congenital scoliosis, neuromuscular and syndromic. Spinal deformity is often progressive and may compromise cardiorespiratory function.||The goal of treatment is to prevent further avoiding spinal fusion in a subject in growth. Surgery is indicated in case of failure or cons-indication of conservative treatment (corset or plaster). The principle is to position the posterior rods subcutaneous or in muscle attached to two ends of the deformation.||Intraoperative distraction allows correction of the deformity. A new distraction is performed every 6 months until skeletal maturity.||Considerable complication rates are reported (58%), mainly implant infections and disassembly, because of the need for multiple reoperations.

NCT03617120,"To assess the efficacy in spinal correction||The efficacy of the Ergonomic Brace refers to the magnitude of spinal correction that could be obtained for patients with AIS. The assessments in this study focus on two aspects, which are i) the in-brace correction and ii) the interface pressure. In-brace correction is used to judge the quality of bracing and also a prognostic indicator for the long-term treatment outcome. Clinical parameters such as Cobb angle, vertebral rotation and trunk listing will be measured with radiographs by a single observer. Interface pressure in this study refers to the pressure between the brace and the trunk of subject. The purpose is to assess the time response of trunk to the intervention of the Ergonomic Brace, and correlation will also be made with the extent of spinal correction.||To evaluate the improvement made to the body appearance of AIS subjects||The trunk aesthetic profile of AIS subjects are being affected by spinal deformities.

NCT04590807,"Background- Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the most common indication for major surgery in adolescents (between 10 and 18 years of age). The current standard of care for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) with a curve magnitude of over 40-50˚ in skeletally immature patients, is posterior spinal fusion with pedicle screws. The aim of spinal fusion is to prevent further curve progression but also to correct the spinal deformity and achieve a cosmetically pleasing result by reducing the rib hump and balancing the trunk and shoulders. While this procedure has been very successful, it has inherent downsides such as the decreased range of motion and loss of spinal mobility in addition to the inhibition of growth along the instrumentation. To prevent distal adding on (continued curve below instrumentation) due to continued anterior spinal growth, it is often necessary to fuse the spine into stable vertebra resulting into even longer spinal fusion levels in the lumbar spine (Sponseller et al. JPO 2016; Oksanen et al. SJS 2018). Spinal fusion increases loading of the remaining mobile segments (Parsch et al. JBJS Br 2001).||In a five-year follow-up study spinal fusion resulted into better health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as compared with untreated AIS (Helenius et al. JBJS 2019). However, the function domain of HRQoL was significantly less after spinal fusion as compared with healthy controls. In contrast, vertebral body tethering using screws connected by a tether in the anterior vertebral body, has the potential to initially correct the still flexible deformity, but most importantly modulate growth and ultimately result in scoliosis correction with a mobile spine.||There is currently a paucity of literature on the effectiveness of vertebral body tethering (VBT) with only retrospective case series published and reported in conference proceedings, and a comparative study is completely lacking. Initial complication rates with the implants for tethering have also sparked caution amongst surgeons and payers whether or not to adopt this technique despite its theoretical advantages. Thus, a high-quality comparative prospective study is missing to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of vertebral body tethering compared to posterior spinal fusion. If this can be shown in a well-designed study, it is likely to result in a paradigm shift in the treatment of AIS similar to the impact earlier technical novelties and achievements had.||Randomised controlled trials are rare in paediatric orthopaedic research. It would be unprecedented that evidence from an RCT is driving a change in practice in scoliosis surgery.||Aims and hypothesis- To compare posterior fusion to VBT for the treatment of AIS. Aim is to demonstrate non-inferiority of VBT compared to posterior fusion in terms of main curve correction of AIS at the 2 year follow up, to demonstrate comparable outcomes for SRS-22/24 at the 2 year follow up. Aim is also to compare complication and revision rates and to compare spinal mobility including flexion and side bending between the study groups.||Inclusion criteria- The inclusion criteria would aim to restrict the study to paediatric patients with AIS and the following criteria: Lenke type I A,B or C, age 10-16 years, skeletally immature (Sanders classification between 2 and 5), Cobb angle 40-60˚, 50% flexibility on supine bending films, selective thoracic fusion feasible||Exclusion criteria- Any other than idiopathic scoliosis, less than 50% curve flexibility, skeletal maturity (Sanders >5), patients who have evidence of neurological disorders, patients who have undergone intrathoracic surgery Outcome parametres- Cobb angle correction of instrumented curve at 2 year follow up, total score of SRS questionnaire at 2 year follow up; secondary outcomes: Complication and revision rates, pulmonary function at 2-year follow-up, spinal mobility at 2-year follow-up||Interventions: AVBT from end to end vertebra. PSF levels using the Lenke criteria.||Ethical aspects- Each institution in each country is responsible for obtaining either institutional review board approval or approval from a national ethics committee as appropriate. An informed consent will be obtained from all children and their parents.||Time schedule and budget- The study will be started on beginning of 2021. Patient enrollment is expected to last to the end of 2023. There will be no extra costs as all information gathered will be part of normal surgical treatment of AIS.

NCT00684112,"Surgical correction of scoliosis involves major orthopedic surgery, and can lead to severe acute postoperative pain and persistent neuropathic pain. The mainstays of treating postoperative pain are acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), systemic opioids, and local anesthetic techniques. Despite being effective, their use is limited by adverse side effects. Acute postoperative pain involves multiple mechanisms and neural pathways, therefore a combination of different analgestic medications acting through different mechanisms, may be the most effective treatment. This strategy may also reduce the need for, and side effects of, using high doses of any one particular class of drugs.||Gabapentin is safe and well tolerated with few side effects and has minimal interactions with other drugs. The use of gabapentin to treat acute postoperative pain may improve quality of analgesia, result in decreased requirements for opioids and might consequently reduce the incidence of opioid induced side effects. It may also have a direct effect on postoperative nausea and vomiting, and decrease the incidence of persistent neuropathic pain. These qualities make gabapentin an attractive agent for use in management of postoperative pain in children undergoing corrective spinal injury.||The primary aim of this study is to determine whether the use of gabapentin will improve postoperative analgesia and reduce opioid consumption and side effects in children undergoing corrective spinal surgery for idiopathic scoliosis. Secondary aims are to evaluate whether use of gabapentin reduces pain scores, decreases postoperative nausea and vomiting, decreases persisting pain and improves patient satisfaction.",Scoliosis
NCT04226209,"Scoliosis is a complex 3-dimensional deformity of the spine characterized by rotation of the vertebra at least 10 degrees lateral deviation and a decrease in the normal kyphotic curvature of the spine. Although the etiology of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is unknown, it is the most common type of scoliosis that occurs in the period from the age of 10 until the skeletal development is completed.||It is reported in the literature that AIS is associated with balance dysfunction, vestibular system defect, proprioceptive disorder, and brain stem dysfunction. In visual, vestibular and somatosensorial systems responsible for postural control, central integration and motor response may be impaired in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. It was also reported that the foot position and center of pressure was changed.||Postural stability can also be defined as maintaining an upright posture during standing. Different spinal deformities, such as scoliosis, can affect postural stability during upright and equilibrium activities. It has been reported that balance control problems seen in patients with AIS result from the relationship between body shape and body segments. Furthermore, lateral stability of these patients was found to be more inadequate when compared to their healthy counterparts.||Schroth method is a highly effective exercise method in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. This method mainly focuses on the 3-dimensional scoliotic curvature formed by the combination of lateral, frontal and rotational deviation and tries to normalize the curvature of the spine by combining this curvature with stretching, strengthening and breathing exercises. It is seen that the 3D Schroth exercise method has a high effect on strength and chest expansion and also has an effect on Cobb angle, asymmetry, daily living activity, balance, vital capacity, pulmonary function and foot pressure.There are also studies showing that body weight transfer in AIS changes according to the level and shape of scoliotic curvature. However, the study investigating the effect of Schroth 3D exercises on changing body statics is quite limited and only one study found that Schroth exercises were more effective in weight distribution than Pilates exercises.",Scoliosis

After fusion surgeries in patients with scoliosis have shown that the static and dynamic postural control were impaired and that the postural control could recover one year after the surgery. The increasing health expenditures over the years have brought along the need for rehabilitation programs conducted in the early term.||Increased postoperative pain, impaired balance reactions in the short, weak EMG responses of the trunk muscles, decreased pulmonary capacity and increased health costs have necessitated early rehabilitation in patients who had undergone scoliosis surgery.

However, the in-brace correction is hardly maintained and the effectiveness of orthotic treatment is limited, which has been an impetus to develop a more effective method for AIS patients to fulfill the unmet need. In order the orthosis is effective, biomechanical intervention and the patient compliance are two key factors. The purpose of this two-year project is to develop a new spinal orthosis in which an integrated system of electric surface stimulation and heat sensing is imbedded such that the AIS will be effectively treated with the mechanical orthosis plus a nocturnal use of electrical stimulation. In addition to the already stellar device, a totally new concept of spine erectability is proposed to provide evidence that can manifest the unique value of orthotic treatment as opposed to surgery. It is hypothesized that the new spinal orthosis would not only reduce the Cobb angle and apical rotation but also would strengthen the spine erectability in AIS patients. The new device with digital technology provides a new avenue to enable clinicians to communicate wirelessly with the imbedded core system such that they can adjust the electrical stimulation parameters and retrieve the temperature data for further compliance analysis. The smart phone and cloud technology can be effectively applied for both security and convenience. The electrical stimulation technology integrated with the total contact spinal orthosis combines the external correction forces on the spinal skeleton from the passive orthosis with the muscle forces at the lateral trunk from the stimulation process. The electrical stimulation is purposely to tone the muscle in order to replace the external mechanical forces gradually. Ultimately, when being weaned off the orthosis, patients may maintain the correction. With the spinal orthosis, the applied current in stimulation process would be reduced and the skin irritation would too. First year, there will be three tasks. An instrument will be developed for clinicians to assess the applicability of electrical surface stimulation to each AIS patient. System integration of the spinal orthosis with electrical surface stimulation and heat sensing will be accomplished. Clinical study of the effectiveness of passive spinal orthoses on 30 AIS subjects as a control group, where the Cobb angle, apical rotation and spine erectability will be measured before treatment and after. Second year, another 30 AIS patients will be recruited; the applicability of electrical surface stimulation will be assessed; and the new spinal orthosis will be applied to the experiment group. The Cobb angle, apical rotation and spine erectability will be measured before treatment and after for each subject. Independent t test will be carried out for the two groups to test the hypothesis.",Scoliosis

NCT01451788,"Background: Posterior spinal deformity surgery can be associated with major blood loss, especially from cancellous bone or epidural venous plexus. Products such as Gelatin Matrix with bovine derived thrombin (Floseal) can be used to prevent blood loss in adult patients undergoing spine surgery.||Aim: To document and compare effectiveness of Gelatin matrix with human derived thrombin with conventional blood loss control methods in adolescents undergoing posterior spinal deformity surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), who do not need vertebral column resection.||Methods: The Finnish Paediatric Orthopaedic Study Group will perform a prospective randomized, multicenter, clinical trial comparing Gelatin matrix with human derived thrombin (Floseal, Baxter) and without use of Floseal in adolescents undergoing posterior spinal deformity surgery for AIS (adolescent idiopathic scoliosis between 45 and 90 degrees) in Turku, Tampere and Helsinki Children's Hospitals. Sixty patients will be randomized into the intervention group receiving Floseal (n=30) and control group not receiving Floseal (n=30). Each University Hospital will treat 10 Floseal and 10 conventional treated scoliosis patients (block randomization). Both treatment groups will be allowed to use conventional blood saving methods.||Main outcome measures:||Blood loss during surgery (millilitres) Drain output during 24 hours (millilitres) Total blood loss (Blood loss during surgery + drain output, millitres) Used blood products (Red cell, frozen plasma, and thrombocyte units) Time of surgery Hospital stay Cost benefit analysis (blood product use, surgical time, hospital stay) Complications related to use of Floseal as a secondary outcome measure.||Primary Hypothesis and expected outcomes: Use of Floseal will reduce blood loss and surgical time in patients undergoing spine surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (Level-I evidence). Cost benefit analysis will most probably show that the use of Floseal is cost effective. E.g. the value of one allogenic Red Blood Cell unit is 400€. If no red blood cell units are needed instead of the usual three, the reduced blood product use alone will cover the extra costs of Floseal use. In addition, if no allogenic blood infusions are needed, the risk of infections will probably be significantly less. Reduced surgical time and shorter hospital stay may also be cost reducing findings in patients receiving Floseal.||Safety Aspects: Gelatin Matrix with human derived thrombin (Floseal, Baxter Biosurgery) is indicated for blood loss control in patients undergoing spine surgery when other methods are less effective.",Scoliosis
NCT01776736,"For AIS, the caring of patients with spinal deformities has a long and varied history. Severe spinal deformities can greatly reduce pulmonary and cardiac functions, which may lead to death from cardiopulmonary failure. Therefore, surgery is generally suggested when the curvature of the spine is greater than 45-50 degrees. The adverse psychological impact of orthoses treatment on patients and its poor compliance has been a well-recognised problem. Some orthotic research studies indicate that early intervention of spinal deformities is particularly desirable. Taking into consideration current clinical practices, if the curve is less than 20 degrees, even if the child is at a high risk of progressive spinal deformity during the age of 10-16 at puberty, treatment is nothing more than just observation.||This project aims to combine clinical experience with textile and materials sciences to research and develop a posture correction girdle for adolescents with early scoliosis. As a result, this will reduce the future likelihood of brace wear or surgery.||The eligible subjects will be given tailor-made posture correction girdles.

NCT03858244,"Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is the most common pediatric musculoskeletal disorder that causes a three-dimensional spinal deformity affecting 2 to 4% of adolescent subjects. It can be progressive (in 3 out of 10 cases) and severe involving serious effects (spine pain, cardiopulmonary compromise, deformed torso, psychosocial issues) and heavy treatments (corset, surgery). However, there is still no reliable criteria to predict the occurrence and progression of IS, while the etiology of IS remains unclear.||Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children is a common condition characterized by recurrent events of upper airway obstruction during sleep.

NCT03716843,"Global rates of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) range from 0.9% to 12%, and within this population, approximately 10% of adolescents aged 10-16 will eventually need treatment. The most common conservative treatment is bracing, in which AIS patients are prescribed a brace for 18 to 23 hours daily until skeletally mature. The objective of bracing is to stop curve progression and restore normal alignment of the spine by active pressure from the brace. There is strong clinical evidence of a positive correlation between the tightness of daily brace application and the ability of the brace to decrease the risk of curve progression to a surgical threshold. However, patients suffer physical and functional discomfort resulting from pressure points, including pressure ulcers, skin irritation and even asthma attacks, which reduces compliance with brace treatment. Clearly, the knowledge of human body responses to pressure applied by brace treatment remains lacking.||This multi-disciplinary collaborative study involves experts in electrical and electronic engineering, orthopaedics, materials science and textiles, and biomechanics. A revolutionary pressure measurement system that integrates fibre optic sensors with textile yarns will be developed in the form of an undergarment. The sensor arrangement in the undergarment will be designed according to the body landmarks of scoliotic patients and critical areas where active pressure is applied by the brace. The overall pressure distribution and dynamic pressure between the body and the scoliosis brace will be measured. The efficacy of the brace design will be evaluated, and the maximum compressive stresses that patients can endure on different body parts without pressure injury can be computed.||Academia, clinicians and AIS patients are predicted to benefit from using the pressure system, which determines the optimum pressure to be exerted on patients while minimizing pressure injuries. The output of the project can be extended to the standardization of pressure levels applied by different orthotic devices and will add a new dimension to fibre optic applications in biomechanics.",Scoliosis

NCT02755766,"Bracing compliance, or the ability of patients to tolerate prescribed bracing regimens, has been shown to be related to the success of treatment. In pediatric orthopedics, bracing is used as one treatment option for a number of diagnoses and reasons. Two populations that are commonly prescribed bracing as part of the treatment paradigm are infants with clubfeet following Ponseti casting and adolescents with scoliosis.||For adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis, bracing is used to stop or slow progression of curves with the hope to delay or prevent the need for surgical intervention. Research has shown that bracing significantly decreased curve progression in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, and that the benefits of bracing increased with longer hours of brace wear.||Likewise, bracing is common practice for treating infants with clubfeet. All infants with clubfeet at SHC-Lexington are prescribed a bracing regimen following the completion of their Ponseti casting protocol. Previous research has shown that noncompliance with brace wear is strongly associated with recurrence of clubfeet in this population. Recurrence often leads to surgical intervention for these infants. Previous Kosair funded research conducted at SHC-Lexington investigated actual brace wear rates compared to the prescribed wear time in a sample of infants with clubfeet. In that study, brace wear rate significantly declined in the first three months of wear. That study did not look at factors related to the compliance with brace wear.||While studies have shown that better outcomes are associated with brace wear compliance in the scoliosis and clubfoot populations, compliance rates are still poor. Reasons identified by patients, parents and research for not complying with prescribed brace wear include the inconvenience or irritability of the child when in the brace in the case of clubfeet, and fear of looking different from peers, clothes not fitting properly, or discomfort in the case of scoliosis. While reasons for noncompliance are many and can be complex, there has been some research to indicate that personality traits may play a role in brace wear compliance. Work done by Rivett looked at personality traits of scoliotic girls who wore a Cheneau brace (a brace not commonly prescribed in North America and the United Kingdom) and found that those who were compliant with their bracing prescription tended to be more emotionally mature, stable and realistic than the noncompliant group. Although not well studied, personality traits of infants with clubfoot and their caregiver might similarly affect their compliance with brace wear.||Past work has shown that when braces are worn as prescribed, treatment outcomes are improved in those with scoliosis and clubfoot, yet bracing compliance is a consistent problem in both populations. With adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and clubfoot being the largest and third largest populations seen at SHC-Lexington, 3700 active patients and 2500 active patients, respectively, it is imperative that we address brace wear compliance in order to offer the best treatment outcome possible. At SHC-Lexington, during 2013 approximately 30 AIS patients and 50 infants with clubfoot were prescribed braces for the first time.||The primary purpose of the proposed study is to determine if personality traits are related to compliance patterns for individuals undergoing brace treatment for AIS or Clubfeet. This pilot project will examine different measures used to assess personality traits of adolescents with AIS, babies with clubfeet and their parent/guardian/caregiver. Using these identified measures, the association between traits and degree of compliance with the bracing prescriptions will be evaluated. If certain personality traits are identified as indicators for noncompliance, then additional support should be offered to those patients.",Scoliosis

NCT01465295,"Significance Spinal deformity fusion treatment involves some of the most costly and invasive procedures in orthopaedics. The development of an effective treatment method to avoid fusion is needed. Many pediatric spine specialists concur that growth modulation displays compelling pre-clinical and clinical data that must be studied further. While bracing is the only non-operative modality with any evidence of effectiveness for idiopathic scoliosis, its level of effectiveness compared to observation or natural history remains inconclusive. Research has been published for over 50 years, yet conflicting literature reports both successes and failures. Most literature consists of retrospective reports of bracing experience, with little commonality relative to existing conditions at the time bracing is initiated, documentation of compliance and basis for judging success.||The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent panel of private-sector experts in primary care and prevention. The Task Force was convened by the U.S. Public Health Service to systematically review the evidence of effectiveness of clinical preventive services. One of their charges was to evaluate the evidence supporting the practice of school screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. After systematically reviewing the literature to date, their policy statement issues in 1992, and updated in 1996 states ""…There is inadequate evidence to determine whether brace therapy limits the natural progression of the disease in a significant proportion of cases, as most studies suffer from selection bias, lack of internal control groups, inadequate follow-up, small sample sizes, and lack of health outcome measures.""||There is no Level One evidence to support the practice of bracing, and clinicians are left with conflicting and questionable inferences regarding bracing effectiveness. Some clinicians believe the evidence favors a decrease in the rate of curve progression, and based on this assumption, over half the states in the U.S. have mandated school screening programs for the detection and early treatment of scoliosis. On the other hand, groups such as the USPSTF, its British and Canadian counterparts and many individual practitioners worldwide feel the evidence is inconclusive and are therefore ambivalent about brace treatment.||Due to the variability in published results on brace effectiveness, researchers in the United States and Canada have commenced a randomized multi-center trial of bracing versus no bracing to determine the effectiveness of brace wear in the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis (BRAIST Study). This study, which was initiated in 2007 in the United States, is being performed under the auspices of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Canadian Institute of Health. In the Netherlands, a randomized multi-center study comparing bracing to observation is also underway.||While bracing treatment is non-invasive and preserves growth, motion and function of the spine, it does not correct the deformity. In addition, the brace pressure on the rib cage and the influence on the chest wall in a growing child create concerns. Some scoliosis patients wear a brace for as long as five years only to learn that brace treatment failed and then recommended to endure major fusion surgery and recovery.||When surgery (fusion and instrumentation) is required for scoliosis, internal fixation of the spine to achieve correction and bony fusion is performed. Surgical correction via posterior fusion is typically performed for curves greater than 40 - 50°, often with accompanying discectomy and release of the anterior longitudinal ligaments for curves greater than 75°. Smaller incisions or use of portals for anterior surgery became available in the early 1990's with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Potential advantages include less muscular and chest wall disruption, less impact on pulmonary function, quicker recovery time and smaller scars. Arlet (2000) completed a meta-analysis of 10 articles with a total of 151 patients, where VATS was utilized in scoliosis surgery. Of the 151 patients, 18% (27 complications) experienced major and minor complications, including major bleeding (3), prolonged ventilation (10), pulmonary complications (6), intercostal neuralgia (number not specified), aborted procedure (3), and one each chylothorax, infection, and tachycardia. A conclusion could not be drawn as to whether the complication rate is increased or decreased with VATS. The correction rate was similar to open thoracotomy.||Scoliosis fusion surgery involves extensive posterior and/or anterior spine exposure with associated risks, frequent blood transfusions (2 to 4 units), high postoperative pain, loss of motion of the treated segment, and slow rehabilitation. The child also has potential life-long complications that do not present for several years after surgery, including adjacent segment disease or degeneration that in many cases requires additional surgery.||Andersen conducted a study of 100 braced and 115 surgical patients with idiopathic scoliosis 10 years after the treatment was completed. The SF-36 scores (patient physical and mental health assessment) did not differ between the two groups; however, both group's scores were lower than age-matched normal controls. Results for the braced patients indicated that 17% felt that the brace was so unpleasant that they would rather take the chance of curve progression than wear a brace. Of the braced patients, 71% indicated that they would have preferred an operation (fusion) to a brace. More than two of three patients didn't wear the brace as prescribed due to skin irritation. Other investigators have refuted the impact of bracing on the quality of life.||Thus, neither bracing nor surgical fusion treatments represent an ideal treatment of idiopathic scoliosis. As such, there is a need for idiopathic scoliosis treatments that address the population of patients whose curvature is unlikely to be corrected via bracing but for whom the risks of less invasive non-fusion surgical treatment may be exceeded by the potential benefit in avoiding lifelong progression or an extensive fusion surgery.||The HemiBridge™ System is indicated for progressive idiopathic scoliosis (Lenke Type 1A or 1B) in skeletally immature (Risser Grade 0 and triradiate cartilage open) patients by mechanically modulating spinal growth (hemiepiphysiodesis) and arresting spinal deformity progression without the need for spinal fusion. The HemiBridge™ System is intended to be placed at contiguous levels through an anterior thoracoscopic procedure on the convex side of a main thoracic curve that measures 25° to 40°, where the end of the vertebrae of the curve spans levels inclusive of or between T3 and L1. The HemiBridge™ System is intended for males and females with a chronologic age of 10 years and older. Females with an Atlas Matching bone age ≥ 8 years and 10 months not to exceed 13 years (or pre-menarche) and males with an Atlas Matching bone age ≥ 10 years not to exceed 15 years.||Innovation The study device, named the HemiBridgeTM System, is the result of extensive pre-clinical research and development initiated by Donita Bylski-Austrow, PhD and Eric Wall, MD both of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati. Research and development of the study device to date has used an interdisciplinary team, including pediatric spine surgeons, engineers, scientists and regulatory experts. This team has helped define the compressive loading required to alter growth, tested prototype devices in preclinical models, improved the test articles for clinical use, and confirmed repeatable in-vivo results in compliance with FDA Good Laboratory Practices. This process has led to the approval of a study device that has achieved FDA and IRB approvals to begin clinical phase testing.||The HemiBridge System's innovation is in its ability to apply mechanical hemiepiphysiodesis to redirect spine growth and developed to accommodate adolescent physiologic loading while remaining securely fastened to the spinal motion segment. Additionally, the System includes innovative patient safety and surgeon interface features. The surgical technique and instrumentation were co-developed by SpineForm LLC and the Orthopaedics Department at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.||The application of mechanical hemiepiphysiodesis to treat progressive scoliosis challenges the use of external bracing and/or observation (watchful waiting). Comparing the pooled rates for these two non-operative interventions shows no clear advantage of either approach; therefore, one cannot recommend one non-operative approach over the other to prevent the need for surgery in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Arresting curve progression with the HemiBridge System and avoiding fusion may significantly impact quality of life while reducing total lifetime patient care cost. Providing patients with a surgical alternative that is superior to the current non-operative standard of care is a paradigm shift that must be studied further to determine its safety and indications for use.||The clinical study protocol design is limited to patients at the highest risk of progressing to needing multi-level fusion surgery. There are no medical devices cleared by the FDA to treat late juvenile or early adolescent onset of idiopathic scoliosis. The HemiBridge System is the first mechanical compression device FDA approved for pediatric investigational use. The proposed study is the first use in humans of the HemiBridge System. The clinical trials will enable the study sponsor to gather prospective information to continuously improve the product, its indications, the next study phase clinical protocol design and recommended surgical technique.",Scoliosis

NCT00448448,"AIS is characterized by a lateral curvature of the spine greater than 10 degrees plus rotation of the spinal vertebrae. AIS is found in adolescents between the age of 10 and time of skeletal maturity. Progression of a spinal curve to 50 degrees suggests a high risk for continued curve progression throughout adulthood and usually indicates the need for spinal fusion surgery. Only about 10 percent of adolescents with AIS end up having curves that progress and require surgical intervention. While certain risk factors for curve progression have been identified, there is no reliable way of estimating the likelihood of needing surgery. Bracing is currently the standard of care for treating AIS. However, the effectiveness of bracing remains unclear, and it is unknown which adolescents in particular may benefit from bracing. Therefore, adolescents undergo bracing without knowing their likelihood of avoiding surgery. The purpose of this study is to compare the risk of curve progression in adolescents with AIS who wear a brace versus those who do not and to determine whether there are reliable factors that can predict the usefulness of bracing for a particular individual with AIS. The study will also evaluate the best dosing and duration schedule and how bracing affects quality of life, functioning, and psychosocial adjustment among participants.||Participation in this study will last until a participant reaches skeletal maturity or their spinal curve progresses to 50 degrees, after which usual care will continue. Participants will either be 1)randomly assigned to a treatment or 2) may decline randomization and choose their own treatment arm. Study visits will occur every 6 months at an orthopaedic surgeon's office and will include x-rays, a clinical exam, and questionnaires. Participants assigned to braces will be instructed to wear the brace at least 18 hours per day. Temperature monitors placed in the brace will be used to determine the actual wear time by each participant.",Scoliosis
NCT01103115,Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent condition mainly affecting females with disease onset at early puberty. It can lead to serious health problems and is associated with low bone mass which can persist with growth. Osteopenia is found to be an important prognostic factor for curve progression in AIS. Nutritional studies indicated AIS subjects had low dietary calcium intake. Evidences suggested that Vit D insufficiency could be present in AIS. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation can therefore be a viable treatment option for low bone mass in AIS subjects. The primary objective of this prospective randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial is to find out whether calcium and vitamin D supplementation can improve bone mineral density (BMD) in osteopenic AIS subjects. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the supplementation is effective in controlling curve progression in AIS.,Scoliosis
NCT02581358,"Scoliosis is a three dimensional spinal deformity, in both the coronal plane, sagittal and transverse planes. Quantitative assessment of curve severity in scoliosis is important for patient management. At present, Cobb angle measurement in the frontal plane using standing postero-anterior X-ray radiograph is the gold standard for scoliosis evaluation. Taking x-ray involves irradiation and is not without risk especially over repeated exposures for follow-up visits. With advancement of ultrasound technology which is radiation-free and noted to be useful as a tool for musculoskeletal imaging, an ultrasound system designed for evaluation of spinal deformity called Scolioscan has been developed. It comprises of a freehand 3D ultrasound imaging system with an enhanced frame structure for supporting the patient to maintain the posture during scanning and a software for measuring curve deformity in terms of Cobb angles. Previous studies on validity of ultrasound assessment for back deformity involved a pilot group of subjects. Based on these promising pilot results, we plan to carry out a formal study to investigate the validity of Scolioscan for quantitative assessment of curve severity in scoliosis using x-ray radiograph as the gold standard for comparison.",Scoliosis

NCT03990376,"Bleeding is a necessary and unavoidable part of spine surgery. It is important to the surgeons and anesthesiologists to know how much blood a patient has lost during surgery in order to care for them in the best way possible. Different methodology has been employed to estimate how much blood is lost during surgery, but unfortunately none of the methods used have been reliable. The study will calculate surgical blood loss by determining perioperative change in red cell volume that is directly measured by using a special method that relies on radioisotope I-131-labeled albumin administration (BVA-100) during the surgery. This benchmarked blood loss estimate will then be compared to estimates calculated using the Gross equation, the Bourke and Smith equation, and the Camarasa formula. In addition, blood loss will be estimated volumetrically by utilizing formulas based on the amount of salvaged blood produced by an intraoperative salvaging system (Cell Saver®).

NCT03292601,"The current method to set brace tension is subjective; it is limited to the attending clinician making a mark on the brace straps, to which the patient tightens the straps during daily wear. Once the strap is set in place, the current standard-of-care does not involve any more monitoring. Therefore, ideal strap tension is unknown and the effectiveness of bracing may be unknowingly compromised by many as yet unidentified variables. In recent years, a small number of studies have emerged related to the strap tension of bracing yet no clear guidelines on correct strap tension currently exist. Considering the potential effects on preventing scoliosis progression and brace-associated complications, the need for guidelines regarding optimal brace fit are greatly needed for clinical use. Via this brace monitoring study, continuous monitoring of tension at brace fitting, throughout the day, and related to positional changes will be possible with a very minimal device and smartphone application. The tremendous amounts of data generated by the device and its app will be used to create a database from which our team will gather information about brace wear compliance and use tension information for the development of standards for effective strap tension associated with greater scoliosis curve correction. Lastly, the effect of a patient's engagement with his or her brace - through the smartphone app - will be examined. It is well established in the literature that observation increases compliance, but no studies investigating patient self-monitoring through personal devices currently exists. This is a vital area of investigation given the recent explosion in personal health-assessing devices e.g. the Apple watch, Up band, fitbit, etc.",Scoliosis

NCT04175145,"Posterior spinal fusion with pedicle screws has become the ""gold standard"" for the management of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Pedicle screws provide three column fixation through the strongest part of vertebra thereby enhancing surgeon's ability to do a 3-dimensional deformity correction. The higher pullout strength results in less long-term loss of correction, shorter fusions resulting in preservation of motion segments, lower pseudarthrosis rates and lower implant failures compared with these alternative posterior instrumentation systems. However, studies are contradictoryregarding the effect of metal density on coronaland sagittal curve corrections. Multiple factors including curve flexibility, instrumentation and rod types, reduction strategies and curve types, affect outcomes. Given this, intraoperative decisions regarding the number of anchorage points remain difficult, with considerable inter-surgeon variability.||The rationale for using a high implant density constructs is to obtain more rigid fixation and to limit potential stress concentration at any one screw. Furthermore, health-related quality of life instruments such as the SRS 22, 24, or 30 seem to show little correlation with curve correction. The placement of every additional pedicle screw is associated with increased operative time, risk of neurological deterioration and increased implant cost. If implant density can be lowered without compromising clinical results, reducing the number of screws may improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of scoliosis surgery. Several authors have demonstrated successful results with low-density instrumentation for the treatment of scoliosis. The purpose of this retrospective review is to describe the demographics of our patient population and to ascertain correlation between metal density and correction achieved.",Scoliosis
NCT02552615,"In patients with idiopathic scoliosis (IS), in addition to curve progression there are many problems including altered posture, gait deviations, muscular imbalance, functional limitations, back pain, negative physico-social, body image effects, and in severe cases pulmonary symptoms commonly occur. To cope with these complications and more, conservative treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) involves a variety of bracing methods and exercises.||Spinal bracing is an important treatment option to prevent curve progression in moderate curves (between 20-40) and severe curves in AIS. Bracing success rate is reported 80% in the long term but the level of evidence is still low.||In literature, exercises are recommended to reduce progression, to improve spine and thoracic cage flexibility, muscle elasticity and strength, to correct postural behavior, and neuro-motor control, spine stability. In general, traditional exercises (TE) including stretching, strengthening exercises for spinal musculature, postural training, respiratory exercises have been used for many years for IS. Besides traditional exercises, there are several exercise concepts including SEAS, Schroth, Dobomed, Side Shift methods... etc. Effectiveness of exercise is still in debate and there is need for further studies, which investigate the role of specific exercises for scoliosis in conservative treatment.||In scoliosis, muscle imbalances, the deficiency of muscle ability to stabilize posture, the loss in balance of pelvis-spine relation due to lateral tilt of the body and postural control impairment resulting from these problems are defined. In addition, the tree dimensional scoliotic deformity cause sensory disturbances, standing instability and gait modifications. Core stabilization exercises (CSE) are described as therapy technique that improve neuromuscular control, strength of trunk stabilization muscles, endurance of postural muscles, trunk mobilization muscles around spine, balance between pelvis and spine in order to maintain functional stability and postural control.||It was indicated in the literature that patients with AIS exhibit disturbances of vertical perception. Postural vertical line is important for a person to perceive body orientation in space and thereby to provide and maintain upright posture and gait. Body Awareness Therapy (BAT) is a mind-body approach, which aims to improve body awareness, body posture, quality of movements, balance, postural control integrating with slow movement co-ordination and breathing exercises. BAT programs also contain stretching exercises, relaxing exercises and gait training. Patients are instructed to concentrate body vertical line and all movements are thought to initiate from body center. BAT have been studied in many medical conditions including back pain, anxiety, fibromyalgia, eating disorders, heart diseases, falls in elderly.||However, there are limited studies determining CSE effects on patients with scoliosis: one have reported improvement in Cobb's angle and pain and the other in sitting balance with lumbar stabilization exercises. There was no research examining the effects of BAT in scoliosis. However for the reasons mentioned above, we hypothesized that CSE and BAT therapies can have positive effects on postural re-alignment and trunk deformity in patients with AIS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of core stabilization and body awareness exercises versus traditional exercises in addition to brace wearing on vertical perception, trunk asymmetry, cosmetic deformity and health related quality of life in patients with AIS.||The aim of this study was to compare the effects of spinal stabilization and body awareness exercises in addition to brace wearing versus traditional exercises on subjective verticality perception, trunk symmetry, cosmetic deformity and health related quality of life in Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).

NCT03814239,"At investigators institution, neither anesthetic approaches to replacement of blood or fluid losses were standardized before 2014 for scoliosis surgery. Before 2014, fluid therapy was liberal and according to general principles of good clinical practice and ephedrine boluses of 5 mg were given when fluid boluses failed to maintain a systolic arterial pressure >90 mm Hg. Blood was replaced with crystalloid at a 3:1 ratio and colloid at a 1:1 ratio. Regarding blood product transfusion anesthesiologists were generally initiated when hemoglobin levels were less than 8 g/dl or less than 10 g/dl in patients with coronary diseases and predonated autologous or allogeneic RBCs were administered.||A protocol of management for scoliosis surgery was implemented in 2014 and included: a) fluid therapy according to SVV monitor, b) intraoperative permissive hypotension to reduce active bleeding (goal mean arterial pressure 60 mmHg), c) prophylactic tranexamic acid infusion (30 mg/kg bolus, 1mg/kg/hr during surgery), d) restrictive RBC trigger according to national standardized protocols (Hb<7.0 g/dL or <9g/dL in patients with coronary diseases) and e) use of perioperative cell savage.||In patients of Group Pro, basal crystalloid infusion was started at 4 ml/kg/h right after general anesthesia induction and intubation.

NCT02862392,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a tridimensional spine deformation affecting 2% of subjects between 10 and 16 years-old being predominant among girls. It is a severe, progressive and multifactorial disease, and a genetic origin is currently admitted.||AIS is progressive (in 3 out of 10 cases) when the scoliosis radiographic frontal angle (Cobb angle) strictly increases by 5° between the diagnosis date and the end of growth. This progression can be severe requiring heavy treatments (corset, surgery) and it can generate adverse effects (spine pain, cardio-respiratory and functional consequences on walking). The lack of reliable criteria to predict the evolution of AIS is a real problem for the therapeutic decision and it can impact the socio-economic cost of the disease.||Several studies show orthostatic postural control anomalies in AIS. The orthostatic postural control is elaborated from the central integration of different sensorial signals (visual, somesthesic and vestibular).||Posturography, on computerized integrate force plates, allows to quantify sensorial components of orthostatic postural control. This technique can confirm the disorders of orthostatic postural control in AIS, but the parameters used can not evaluate with precision the progressive potential.||The posturographic signal analysis could lead to the implementation of therapeutic strategies adapted to progressive risk. Moreover, this method could prevent the progression in major scoliosis, limit the use of radiography, the application of a constraining corset (worn 23 hours a day) and the possibility of heavy surgery (extent arthrodesis).||The hypothesis of this study is that progressive AIS is characterized by a disorder of orthostatic postural control.

NCT02609009,"Introduction Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is defined by the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) has a three-dimensional deviation of the vertebral column of unknown origin appearing in adolescents older than 10 years. Chronic non-specific back pain (CNSBP) is often associated with adolescent scoliosis patients, and the associated prevalence is almost double that of non-scoliosis healthy adolescents. Furthermore, CNSBP seems to be a predictor of CNSBP in adulthood.||Few studies evaluated BP among AIS patients and in those who did, conflicting results, regarding back pain prevalence, were observed. Among these, only two studies looked at back pain in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Ramirez et al. retrospectively evaluated, 2442 scoliosis adolescent patients' files establishing BP prevalence at 32%. He concluded that the established prevalence was similar to the one encountered in a general non-scoliotic adolescent population. Joncas and Labelle prospectively evaluated 239 adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis for the prevalence of BP. They observed that BP occurred in 54% of patients, and the average pain intensity was 49,4 mm. More recently, Sato's studied back pain prevalence in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. He conducted a large-scale cross-sectional epidemiological study, where 43 630 children aged 9 to 15-year-old were required to complete a take-home questionnaire. They reported a back pain prevalence of 58.8% in scoliosis patients compared to 32.9% in non-scoliosis patients.||Regarding BP Management in AIS Patients, a comprehensive review of the literature did not yield any study on BP management in AIS patients. Spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) is a recognised and safe treatment for low back pain and is performed primarily by chiropractors, physical therapists, and osteopaths. To the best of the investigators' knowledge, only one pilot clinical trial (Rowe 2006) has been conducted with children and adolescents diagnosed with AIS. Though under powered, results showed that SMT was associated with only minor adverse events, there was no curve progression in the treatment group, and quality of life, evaluated by the Scoliosis Quality of life Index, has not been negatively impacted.||In light of the paucity of literature on the management of back pain in nonsurgical AIS patients, and considering the lack of evidence in regards to the efficacy of SMT for back pain in adolescents, and the lack of guidance regarding management of back pain in adolescents, it would be important to evaluate the effectiveness of SMT compared to usual medical care for back pain among adolescents with idiopathic nonsurgical scoliosis.||The primary objective of this pilot study is to verify the effect of Spinal Manipulative Therapy on back pain management of adolescents with idiopathic nonsurgical scoliosis. The secondary objectives are two-fold: 1) to verify the effect of SMT on low back function, 2) to verify the feasibility and acceptability of SMT according to patients' level of satisfaction. This pilot study will be used to verify some implementation strategies before proceeding to a subsequent larger trial, such as recruitment rate, treatment compliance and loss to follow up, and adverse events.||Methods: Study Design This pilot study is a single prospective centre randomised controlled trial with one experimental and one control group. This study will be recruiting from Ste-Justine University Hospital in Montreal, Canada, and patients will be required to attend at least 80% of the treatment sessions otherwise they will be considered as non-compliant. Chiropractors will be recruited from their professional regulatory board. Different instruments will be used during this trial: questionnaires; the Brief Pain Inventory Questionnaire, and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire; the modified Fingertip-to-floor distance, the modified-modified Schöber test, and the Biering-Sorenson back muscles extensor test. Patients will be evaluated upon trial entry and at 4 weeks (end of trial). Co-interventions will be documented and accounted in the analysis. Eligible patients will be randomized according to blocks of 4 to either the experimental (SMT) or the control (UMC) arm after informed consent has been obtained. The randomisation list will be generated and managed by an independent statistician. Statistical software SPSS version 22 will be used for data analyses. All analyses will be conducted under the intention-to-treat principle. To ensure balance, groups will be compared for possible confounders (age, gender, brace) at baseline. The group mean (Std. Deviation) and frequencies will be presented. Tests will be 2-tailed, and the significance level will be set at 0.05. Statistical analysis will include t-test (or Mann-Whitney) for continuous variables and χ2 for categorical variables.

NCT00689533,"Number of Patients Planned: A total of 250 patients requiring treatment with the VEPTR device and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. All patients enrolled in this study will receive the VEPTR device.||Duration of Follow-up: Patients will be clinically followed post-surgery throughout the course of the patient's treatment. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled at 1, 6, and 12 months post-surgery and every year thereafter until 5 years after the index procedure, then every 2 years until the final planned procedure, or the completion or spinal growth (typically about 2 years after menarche in girls, or the equivalent in boys), whichever occurs first. Other patient visits may occur as deemed necessary.||General Design and Methodology: This is a prospective, multi-center, clinical study to evaluate the use of VEPTR devices for preventing further progression of the Cobb angle, a measure of the curvature of the spine, determined from measurements made on radiographs, allowing for spinal growth and improving pulmonary function in the treatment of children with progressive scoliosis without rib abnormalities. Unilateral vs. Bilateral, and use of an opening wedge thoracostomy, are at the discretion of the surgeon. The treatment would be used regardless of the study, therefore it is routine care. The primary study hypothesis is that, in regard to key clinical and radiographic outcomes, the success rate of the VEPTR device is at least 90%. A secondary study hypothesis is that in regards to key pulmonary outcomes (improvement in pulmonary function tests and increase in lung volume as measured by CT scans), the success rate of the VEPTR device is at least 90% (see Primary Study Endpoints below). Details of the patient outcomes and the study hypothesis are given below. With correction for 10% attrition, 250 patients split between the participating institutions will be enrolled.||Primary Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint will be based on the findings up to and including the last scheduled patient follow-up visit. An individual patient's treatment will be considered successful only if each of the following criteria are met:||The patient's Cobb angle at the final surgery is less than or equal to the patient's pre-operative Cobb angle and|The patient's trunk height or spinal length at final surgery is greater than or equal to the patient's immediate post-operative trunk height or spinal length",Scoliosis

NCT03305185,"Adolescent Idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine, characterized by a lateral curvature and vertebral rotation. Its prevalence is estimated to be 2.5% in children between aged 10 and 16 in Hong Kong. Curve progression occurs during pubertal growth spurt. If the primary curve does not exceed 40 degree at skeletal maturity, it is unlikely to continue to progress, and there are little or no long-term clinical consequences. However, if the curve progresses beyond 50 degree during adolescence, it may cause functional limitation, accelerated disc degeneration with potential neurological deficit, cosmetic concerns, decreased quality of life, and possible progression in adulthood. Thus, surgical correction of the deformity with instrumented spinal fusion is usually recommended if the curve reaches 50 degree during adolescence.||Currently, spinal bracing is the only the only non-operative treatment supported with high-quality evidence that can prevent curve progression. In a randomized controlled trial, Weinstein et al. recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that bracing was effective in preventing curve progression to threshold for surgery in 72% of cases. The trial was terminated early due to the treatment benefit in favor of bracing. Nonetheless, the authors reported a treatment failure rate of 25% in the randomized cohort, which was similar to previous published studies. Hence, despite the best available non-operative treatment, the number of adolescents ultimately requiring surgery remains substantial. Surgery is associated with medical comorbidities, can cause psychosocial stress to the children and their families, and has significant financial impact on healthcare, with the total costs of spinal surgery to correct AIS ranked second only to appendicitis among children 10 to 17 years of age. Consequently, further effective strategies to prevent scoliosis progression in children are needed.||Scoliosis-specific exercise (SSE) has been proposed as an additional non-operative intervention that may reduce curve progression during the adolescent growth spurt. However, the standard of care for non-operative treatment of AIS varies widely between North America and Europe, and the use of SSE is not universally accepted. SSE is a potentially low-cost intervention that will be of substantial benefit even if a relative risk reduction in curve progression or reaching the threshold for surgery is reduced in a modest proportion of those participating.||SSE, as opposed to generalized physiotherapy, consists of individually-adapted exercises that aim to promote spinal realignment through self-correction and stabilization, as well as modulating patterns of trunk muscles recruitment. Electromyography (EMG) of paraspinal and abdominal muscles in AIS patients revealed disrupted patterns of muscles recruitment, which are associated with a disparity in trunk isometric rotation strength between sides. AIS patients demonstrate proprioceptive and balance control problems, along with a distorted body schema, resulting in a mismatch between the actual spinal alignment and the patients' internal representation of the body. SSE aims to reverse the anomalous patterns of muscle recruitment through training, and modify the body schema with visual and somatosensory feedback. This forms the theoretical neurophysiological basis for using this treatment strategy for AIS.||Schroth SSE is one of the most studied and widely-used schools of SSE. It is a technique tailored to the type of scoliosis and the curve magnitude of each patient. It is based on vertebrae deflections and sagittal corrections that result in horizontal vertebrae de-rotation. It uses rotational breathing and postural auto-correction to reverse the underlying impairments in spinal muscle function, postural control and proprioception which contribute to the development of curvature in AIS. Patients will also be given cognitive behavioral strategies to empower them to self-manage their conditions.",Scoliosis
NCT00155545,"Scoliosis is one of the most common back deformities in children. Idiopathic and functional (secondary) scoliosis are arguably the two most common types. The etiology of idiopathic scoliosis has been studied in many aspects such as genetic factors, skeletal muscle abnormalities, neurological mechanisms, and biomechanical factors, while the common causes of secondary or functional scoliosis are leg length inequality and muscle spasm. It is evident that biomechanical factors that involve the interactions of the musculoskeletal alignment and loading are closely associated with the development of both types of scoliosis.||Leg length discrepancy (LLD) is defined as a condition in which paired limbs are unequal in length. It is now generally accepted that LLD can lead to lumbar scoliosis and it is assumed that scoliosis caused by LLD can be removed if LLD is eliminated. However, no study has documented the effects of the correction of LLD on the functional scoliotic spinal curve and motion during functional activity. Since spinal curve and motion have clear associations with leg length inequality, one would wonder whether idiopathic scoliosis without LLD can be improved by artificially creating a leg length difference with an orthosis when spine surgery is not considered or in a less severe condition. It has been shown that LLD and scoliosis have effects on pain, force transmission and performance of motion. Therefore, the artificially created leg length difference may have negative effects even though the scoliosis is improved. The benefits and disadvantages of using a foot orthosis to create artificial LLD in order to relieve idiopathic scoliosis require careful investigation. Although the biomechanics of the spine or the lower extremities have been studied separately in the literature, the biomechanical interactions between the spine and the lower limbs in scoliosis patients with or without LLD and the biomechanical effects of treatments using foot orthosis on these patients remain to be studied.||Using motion analysis techniques, the present study aims:||to study the biomechanical interactions between the spine and the lower limbs in scoliosis patients with or without LLD during activity;|to investigate effects of correction of LLD using a foot orthosis on the functional scoliotic spinal curve and motion during functional activity; and|to test whether idiopathic scoliosis without LLD can be improved by artificially creating a leg length discrepancy with a foot orthosis. The optimal heights of the foot orthosis for the later two objectives will also be determined. It is hoped that the present study will lead to a better understanding of the mechanical interactions between the spine and the lower extremities in functional and idiopathic scoliosis patients, and a better treatment for these patients.",Scoliosis
NCT02412137,"The investigators plan to enroll 300 subjects prospectively with the hypothesis that some will be lost to followup, and would like a final number of at least 125 in each group. All patients who fit the inclusion criteria and consent to participate in the study will have two temperature monitors installed inside the padding in the front of their brace. The monitors will sample temperature every hour, with room temperature and body temperature representing periods of non-use and use respectively. Each temperature monitor is programmed to record temperature sequentially, so that a longer period of time can be monitored in case the patient's appointments get postponed beyond the time capacity of only one monitor. The monitors will be downloaded into a laptop computer by an orthotist in the scoliosis clinic each visit. A short questionnaire entitled the Brace Beliefs Questionnaire, consisting of 18 questions, will be administered to all patients at the time of brace prescription.||In approximately 50% of the patients, the information would be shared on each follow-up visit with the nurses, orthotist, and physician. Patients are not going to be randomized as communication in the clinic waiting room is common among braced patients. However, by having all patients treated by a specific physician included in either the counseling group, or if treated by a different physician in the standard care group, all patients in the waiting room at a given time would be enrolled in a single arm of the study. The patient and parent will then be given the visit's wear-time information and counseled regarding compliance using this information. A standardized progress report (Brace Progress Report) will be completed by the physician or orthotist.||In the other 50% of patients, only the person downloading the loggers would be aware of wear-time and that information would not be shared with the medical staff. Those patients will not receive detailed counseling regarding the actual hours of brace wear as documented by the temperature loggers, but instead will receive routine clinical care including a discussion about the importance of compliance. Radiographs routinely obtained in the clinic will be measured by the Principle Investigator. No extra radiographs will be obtained based on the participation in this study. The curve will be classified using the criteria of Lenke. Scoliosis will be measured by the Cobb angle technique and the Risser sign charted. Curve progression will be defined as progression of greater than or equal to six degrees. Patients with progression to greater than 45 degrees, who have surgery recommended, or who undergo spinal fusion surgery will be noted.||Enrollment and follow-up, gathering data, and analysis of that prospective data from 200 subjects is estimated to take approximately 5 years. We will not disclose to the subjects that information from the temperature monitors can be used to monitor compliance because such disclosure would change the purpose of the study.||With permission of the authors (Katz, et al, 2010) we will utilize de-identified BMI and brace compliance data from the 100 patients who completed their previous study. This data will be combined with the same information obtained from patient participation in this study since both studies essentially used the same method for measuring patient brace wear compliance. The increased numbers should lend stronger evidence to the findings. A target accrual number of 300 is expected (100 with de-identified retrospective data and 200 prospective study subjects).||SOURCES OF RESEARCH MATERIAL: Existing diagnostic data could come from the patients' medical records and radiographs, but temperature/date/time information downloaded from the loggers, data from the Brace Beliefs Questionnaire, and data recorded in the Brace Progress Report will be obtained specifically for research. Identifiable data obtained specifically for research purposes will be used to answer the study questions. Any data resulting from radiographic studies will be standard of care that is associated with the patient's clinical treatment, so no x-rays will be included for research purposes in this study.||The following information will be collected:||Patient name/ID|Age|Gender|Demographic information necessary to initiate contact with patient, including telephone numbers, address or language|Date and results of physical exams from clinical records and radiographic studies|Treatment history (surgical and non-surgical) and complications of treatment|Temperature/date/time data downloaded from logger|Data from short questionnaire (Brace Beliefs Questionnaire)|Documentation of counseling session with patients who are in the counseling group using Brace Progress Report.|Documentation of no counseling session in the ""no counseling"" group along with the amount of their brace wear compliance as recorded in the Brace Progress report.|For the purpose of reporting any correlation between brace effectiveness and BMI, deidentified data from 100 patients previously enrolled in IRB#0598-2220 will be merged with the same data collected from physical exams and brace compliance data from this study.||RECRUITMENT OF SUBJECTS: Patients will be identified face-to-face as candidates for the study by the treating physician or orthotist at the scoliosis clinics at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children as they present to clinic for diagnosis and treatment of their idiopathic scoliosis when the brace is initially prescribed. They will be invited, all study procedures will be explained to them, and they will be encouraged to have any questions answered. All patients will be informed that temperature loggers are going to be inserted in their orthoses, and that temperature information will be downloaded at each visit. Only the group that will receive counseling will be informed that the temperature information is a measure of brace compliance. The other group will not be informed that the temperature information indicates whether or not, and how often, the brace is worn. Informing them that the logger measures compliance would influence the outcome of the study, and therefore cannot be shared with the patients.||Study Procedures Screening Procedures Subjects will be identified and screened according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria as they present to clinic and are referred by their respective physicians to the Orthotics Department for bracing. This referral is standard clinical procedure.||Study Intervention After the study subject accepts the invitation to participate in the study, they will be asked to sign the consent documents and given copies for their records. The Research Coordinator will record documentation of the recruitment process, invitation to participate in the study, and informed consent on an Invitation Checklist. Subjects are routinely assigned randomly into one of seven orthopaedic physician's clinics on their first visit. Which of the two study groups they belong to will be determined by which physician is seeing them. All physician staff Orthopedists at TSRH have agreed to participate in this study and are listed as sub-investigators.The Principle Investigator will draw physician names to determine which ones will be receiving information about bracewear compliance that is downloaded from the monitors and then provide counseling to their patients, and which physician staff will not be receiving information about bracewear compliance at the patient visits, and thus will not be providing additional counseling based on this information. (1.One group will be counseled after brace temperature/date/time data is logged at each visit. 2. The other group will receive routine clinical care including a discussion about the importance of compliance.)||Procedures and Evaluations All subjects will be fitted by the Orthotist with a customized scoliosis brace that includes the two temperature logger discs (about the size of a nickel coin) which are fitted into the felt lining of the inside front of the brace. The subject will be given their first set of instructions regarding wear and care of the brace (standard clinical procedure) along with the Brace Beliefs Questionnaire (which should take less than 10 minutes and is being done specifically for research purposes. If the patient expresses anxiety at answering questions, they will asked whether they want to continue). At every subsequent clinic follow-up visit (see Follow-up below for frequency and duration), the counseling group will have their brace wear compliance documented on the Brace Progress Report after the Orthotist downloads the time/temperature data onto a laptop from the sensor reader (A piece of computer hardware which the sensor clips into and is attached to the laptop via the USB port). The Orthotist will then reset the temperature logger discs and reinstall them into the padding in the inside front of the brace in order to monitor the next period of brace wear. Depending on which group the patient has been assigned to, they will either be counseled for about 10 minutes or less regarding their brace-wear using the Brace Progress report as a checklist, or receive standard clinical care. Ideally, counseling would be done by the treating physician (standard clinical care) using the Bracing Progress Report Form (done for research purposes only). Counseling may also be done by nurse coordinators involved in the patient's care (which is standard clinical care) utilizing the same Bracing Progress Report Form if the treating physician is not available to do it. Data from the Brace Beliefs Questionnaire will be used to discover the subject's initial attitude about wearing the brace. Brace wear compliance data received from counseled patients will be compared to the same data received from the patients who have received standard clinical care to see whether counseling makes a difference in their compliance and thus their clinical outcomes.||Follow-up Patients will be followed for the duration of their bracing, which typically lasts approximately one to four years, and depends on the rate of their growth and curve progression. Data will be collected each time they present to clinic for follow-up, on average two to three times per year. Each patient will be followed until skeletally mature, two years following brace discontinuation, or until spinal fusion surgery is performed. Final outcomes (whether or not they progress to surgery) will be included in the data collected for this study.)",Scoliosis

During treatment the patients being admitted are monitored at regular intervals, at week 6, after the 3rd month and at 6 months post-intervention to assess the incidence of chronic pain.||The entire study duration is approximately 24 months. The hypothesis of the study is that the combination of subanesthetic doses of ketamine to opioid drugs during the perioperative period reduces central sensitization processes, resulting in lower consumption of postoperative morphine with fewer adverse effects, postoperative faster recovery and less incidence of chronic pain.||The post-operative analgesia is induced by the use of opioids or other analgesics associated with loco-regional techniques. The technique used in the investigators' center is the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with the administration of intravenous opioids.||The association of ketamine to opioid treatment could reduce the consumption of these and can be useful in surgery.

NCT01550497,"Although idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is the most common type of scoliosis, no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of physical therapy exercises for managing low back pain (LBP) in this population. Spinal stabilization exercises are of particular importance in adolescents with IS due to possible reduced spinal stability from structural deformity. Spinal stabilization exercises have been reported to prevent recurrent episodes of LBP in the adult population. However, standardized treatment options cannot be recommended for LBP in adolescents with IS, because the investigators are not certain if spinal stabilization exercises will have the same effect on this patient population. Given the high prevalence of LBP in AIS and limited evidence of conservative interventions, researching the effectiveness of spinal stabilization exercises is warranted.||Currently, there are two common practices for managing adolescents with IS who have LBP: 1) supervised physical therapy and 2) a one-time treatment with no follow-up. No studies have examined which of these two approaches is superior. This study will provide information on optimal management of LBP in AIS. If there is no difference in outcomes between these two approaches, a one-time visit will be the optimal choice of treatment since it is more cost-effective and less burdensome for the family. If the outcomes favor the eight-week supervised physical therapy, specifically the spinal stabilization exercises, this treatment approach should be recommended for managing LBP in AIS.",Scoliosis

NCT03929042,"Background Information Scoliosis in patients between 10 and 18 years of age is termed adolescent scoliosis. The most common type of scoliosis is one of which the cause is not known. This is called ""idiopathic"" or ""adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS)"". The main risk factors of curve progression could be skeletal immaturity, female gender and large curve magnitude. It has been found that nearly 10% of all adolescents have some degree of spinal curve or deformity after their tenth year. The health of patients, such as cardiac and pulmonary functions, may be affected if their spinal deformity is very serious. Hence, the most ideal way is to monitor and control spinal curvature once AIS has been found.||Treatment options for scoliosis In general, patients are suggested to undergo different types of treatments according to their spine situations and stage of scoliosis. Surgery is suggested for patients with spinal curves that are greater than 41-50 degrees, while bracing is a non-invasive treatment suggested for those with spinal curves between 21-40 degrees. Thoraco-lumber-sacral-orthosis (TLSO) or cervico-thoraco-lumbo-sacral orthosis (CTLSO) braces are the most commonly prescribed and used braces. The 3-point pressure system is primarily applied by all TLSO braces in order to correct the spinal curve and reduce the curve progression. The plaster cast is tailor-made according to the body shape of each patient. The upper torso of the wearer needs to be tightly compressed by this non-breathable material for 23 hours every day. The duration of the treatment duration will be for years until the bones are fully mature.||Aside from the fact that newer types of flexible brace products in the market are not available in large numbers, their effectiveness continues to be controversial and there is much room for improvement. The SpineCor Dynamic brace is one of the flexible braces used to treat AIS. The theory behind the SpineCor system is known as spinal coupling. Spinal coupling corrects deformities by reversing abnormal posture and body shape into their opposite position so that the abnormal alignment of the spine can be corrected. As the spinal curve of each patient is different, thus appropriate positions and tensions of the elastics will be respectively placed and adjusted by a professional before the patient wears the brace. It has been found that the curve progression rate of those who wear the SpineCor Dynamic brace is significantly higher than those who wear the rigid brace. It is believed that the ineffectiveness of the flexible brace may be caused by the shifting of the elastic bands. The elastic bands present on the brace are not fixed to the body of the wearer, and may easily shift to other areas during movement. Hence, the corrective force will no longer be exerted onto the correct position for posture and body shape correction.||A summary of the research rationale is listed below. Research rationale 1: Low treatment compliance Treatment through the use of a hard brace has low compliance due to discomfort and psychological issues, such as an awkward and bulky appearance. Flexible braces have other issues, such as discomfort caused by the elastic bands, inconvenience when going to the toilet, and unusual designs, which also result in low compliance. New designs that aim to improve compliance are therefore extremely important.||Research rationale 2: Limited product choice for adolescents with early scoliosis Hard brace treatment is overly excessive for adolescents with early scoliosis due to the high corrective force which nearly constrains all movements. The flexible brace treatment is an alternative option; however, its efficacy remains controversial. Intimate apparel that has a specialized design for teenagers with scoliosis is limited and a large majority can only provide some improvement for poor postures, such as hunchback. A scientific approach should be used to design and develop functional intimate apparel as a treatment option for adolescents with early scoliosis.",Scoliosis

NCT03729947,"Background The use of a subfascial closed suction drain has been a long tradition in adolescents undergoing posterior spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis.1-5 Drain has been used to limit postoperative hematoma and epidural hematoma formation, to decrease risk of postoperative deep wound infection, and to shorten hospital stay. Postoperative 24 hour drain output has been larger than introperative blood loss in these patients.6 Previous studies in adults undergoing total joint replacement have shown increased risk of hematocrit decrease and blood transfusion, but better joint mobilization in patients treated with closed suction drain as compared with those not receiving drain. In patients with lumbar degenerative disorders drain use has been associated with higher risk of blood transfusion and longer hospital stay.7-8 Leaving out subfascial drain has not been associated with increased risk of deep surgical site infection or neurologic deficit, but the number of patients with postoperative saturated dressings has been larger.1-5 There are no Level 1 studies evaluating the need to use a subfascial closed suction drain or not in adolescents undergoing posterior spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis.||Aims and hypothesis To compare postoperative Hemoglobin and hematocrit decrease, length of hospital stay, and hematoma formation in patients receiving and not receiving subfascial drain during posterior spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis. We hypothesize that children not receiving a subfascial drain demonstrate smaller hemoglobin and hematocrit decrease without increased risk of wound or neurologic complications.||Methods Study design - A randomised, multicentre clinical trial according to CONSORT criteria.9 Patients - 60 adolescents undergoing posterior spinal fusion with pedicle screw instrumentation for idiopathic scoliosis will be randomized at the time of wound closure receiving a single subfascial drain (Hemovac 14 ch) or no drain.||Inclusion criteria - Patients will be included if they fulfilled the following criteria: between ten and 21 years of age; no contraindication to the use of subfascial drain; suitable for posterior scoliosis surgery using all pedicle screw technique for AIS (Lenke classification10 Types 1 to 6); normal blood coagulation; a normal whole spine MRI except for the spinal deformity (juvenile or AIS). Exclusion criteria - Need for anteroposterior surgery; the need for vertebral resection; smoking; diabetes mellitus or abnormalities in blood coagulation. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory should be avoided within one week of surgery.||Intervention - The intervention group will receive a single subfascial drain (Hemovac Ch14; Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana). The control group will not receive a drain.||Randomization - Randomization to intervention and control groups (1:1) will be carried out using the sealed envelope technique at the time of wound closure.||Outcomes - The main outcome measures include postoperative decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit and the need for blood products (packed red cells, frozen plasma or platelets). Secondary outcome measures include blood loss (mls), drain output over 24 hours (mls), total blood loss (intra-operative blood loss + drain output); body temperature during postoperative hospital stay; the number of patients with fully saturated wound dressings requiring exchange will be recorded.||Surgery - Surgical planning of implant placement and the need for the Ponte procedure will be carried out preoperatively. Each patient will be placed in the prone position and the posterior elements will be exposed using electrocautery. The deformity will be corrected using bilateral segmental pedicle screw instrumentation and en bloc vertebral column derotation. Spinal fusion is carried out using autograft acquired from facetectomies and osteotomies with bone graft extenders (Grafton, Medtronics Spinal and Biologics). Spinal cord monitoring (MEP, SSEP, lumbar nerve root EMG with or without pedicle screw stimulation) will be undertaken in all patients. A single subfascial drain (Hemovac Ch14; Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana) will be placed according to randomization during closure and will be removed at 24 hours post-operatively. A sterile wound dressing will be applied at the end of surgery. Wound dressings will not be changed before discharge, until they are fully saturated.||Anaesthesia - All patients will have total intravenous anesthesia including dexmedetomidine, propofol and remifentanil with the aim of achieving a mean arterial pressure between 65 mmHg and 75 mmHg during surgery and for the first 24 hours post-operatively. Cefuroxime and Vancomycin will be used as antibiotic prophylaxis.||All patients will receive an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid (30 mg/kg, maximum dose 1500 mg) within 30 minutes before incision and then an infusion (10 mg/kg/h, maximum dose 500 mg/h) during surgery. Intra-operative blood loss will be measured and recorded as the amount of blood collected in the cell saver, surgical wound dressings will be weighed during surgery, excluding any irrigation with saline. The cell saver will be used in all patients and the amount of autologous blood returned is recorded. Allogenic red blood cells will be transfused if the Hb concentration goes below 80 g/L during surgery or during the hospital stay. Fresh frozen plasma will be given if the blood loss exceeds 50% of the patients total blood volume. Platelets will be infused if the blood loss is more than 100% of the blood volume. The estimated blood volume will be calculated using a formula of 70 ml/kg x weight (kg).12 Statistical power - The sample-size requirement of 30 patients per group was calculated using a study power of 80%, a type I error (alpha) of 0.05, and an estimated effect size of 0.7. Effect size evaluation was based on the assumption that mean (SD) postoperative hemoglobin loss (the primary endpoint) would be 30 g/l (SD 14) for the control group and 40 (SD 14) for the intervention group.6 Ethical aspects Ethical committee approval will be obtained at our university hospital. If the subfascial drain could not be used e.g. due to cerebrospinal fluid leakage or based on the surgeon's judgment, leaving it will be allowed, however, the patient will remain in the intervention group for statistical comparison according to the intention-to-treat principle.||Time schedule This study will be started after ethical committee approval estimated in the beginning of 2019 and patient recruitment is estimated to be done by the end of 2023.||Budget Surgical treatment of adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis is according to the standard practice. There will be no extra costs due to this study. A part-time research nurse and PhD students will be hired using Valtion tutkimusrahoitus and external funding.||References||Brown MD, Brookfield KF.

NCT04071665,"Adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS) is the most common spinal deformity in the elderly, and the severe patients need surgical treatment. The elderly are often complicated with many medical diseases and the perioperative risk is high, so minimally invasive surgery is a new choice for spinal surgeons to treat ADS. Modified lateral lumbar interbody fusion (CLIF) is an new modified spinal minimally invasive interbody fusion technique in the investigator's department. The results of preliminary studies showed that it has the advantages of less trauma, short operation time and fewer complications, and the clinical and imaging outcome are remarkable. Therefore, the present study aims to establish a multicenter, large sample prospective randomized controlled study to explore the technical advantages and surgical indications of the new technique in the treatment of ADS by comparing with the traditional posterior spinal interbody fusion; (2) to compare the postoperative clinical and imaging results and analyze the surgical complications and preventive measures; (3) to establish a long-term follow-up to further quantify the clinical and imaging outcome of the new technique. Therefore, this study will further verify the safety and effectiveness of the CLIF in the treatment of ADS on the basis of previous studies, and provide a new clinical approach for minimally invasive treatment of ADS.",Scoliosis

NCT01352949,"OBJECTIVE:||The primary objective of this project is to determine which outcome measures derived from analysis of SP images are reliable within the healthy population and can distinguish between healthy volunteers and those with scoliosis, chest wall deformities, and obesity. Secondary objectives include comparing SP outcome measures with clinical and radiographic measures to test concurrent validity and to determine if the SP outcome measures correlate with clinical and radiographic measures taken over time. The ultimate goal is to develop SP as a measurement tool to be employed in clinical research involving the study of scoliosis, rib and chest deformities and the truncal distribution of adiposity.||STUDY POPULATION:||The population for this study consists of healthy volunteers, persons with scoliosis and/or chest wall deformities, and persons with obesity. Men and women of all races, ethnicities, and ages greater than two years may participate.||DESIGN:||This project will be carried out in three phases. In Phase I, we will analyze images of healthy volunteers captured by the SP scoliosis and chest-wall deformity ( scoliosis ) software to identify the outcome measures that show minimal or no variance. We will also examine if healthy volunteers gender, age, height, and BMI contribute to the differences of these outcome measures.||In Phase IIa, images captured from subjects with scoliosis and/or chest wall deformities will be processed by scoliosis software to determine the set of meaningful variables (those that show significant differences between the two populations). In Phase IIb, images captured of healthy volunteers will be processed using obesity software to determine the set of variables showing minimal or no variance among the data from healthy volunteers when controlling for the effects of potential confounders. Variables that continue to have minimal or no variance will be considered meaningful with respect to obesity analysis software. Those variables achieved from obesity image analysis will be compared to the set from the healthy volunteers to determine which variables show significant differences between the healthy volunteer and obese subjects.||In Phase III, healthy participants, scoliosis/chest wall deformity, and obesity participants who are scheduled to return to NIH as part of another NIH protocol will be invited to return for yearly re-imaging up to a total of five years in order to analyze changes over time and compare them with concurrent radiographic measures.||OUTCOME MEASURES:||The purpose of the study is to develop outcome measures for use in future research.

NCT00323752,"Background The pre-operative autologous donation (PAD) program was established at British Columbia's Children's Hospital in 1988 to decrease the need for homologous blood transfusion. It could alleviate the constraints arising from current and expected future shortages of homologous blood. But, primarily, the introduction of PAD was driven by concern about blood borne diseases.||A patient's own blood is generally considered to be the safest blood. However, the PAD program has several shortcomings. Firstly, venous access for blood withdrawal is often difficult in children. Secondly, the PAD program at British Columbia's Children's Hospital (BCCH) has a history of considerable wastage. Approximately 50% of pre-donated blood is discarded. Thirdly, a patient's medical condition or distance from BCCH can make participation in the program infeasible. Finally, even though the donor and recipient are the same, PAD is still susceptible to bacterial contamination and clerical errors. For example, it is possible that the wrong blood, either homologous blood or another patient's autologous blood, may be given to the PAD donor or another patient.||Wastage, cost, logistic challenges, and safety concerns have driven our interest in an alternative treatment for scoliosis patients. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) is a hormone that stimulates red cell production. This treatment has been used for patients scheduled for scoliosis surgery since 1990. However, it is not part of BCCH's current practice.||Study Objectives The purpose of this study is to establish whether rHuEpo is as effective as PAD in increasing red cell mass prior to surgery. Other benefits of the PAD program and preoperative administration of rHuEpo will also be compared.||A pilot study of 20 subjects to investigate whether the gain in the PAD group is different from the group treated with rHuEpo..||Research Activities Females aged 12 to 18 years that are scheduled to undergo correction of idiopathic scoliosis by posterior fusion will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either participate in the PAD program or receive the rHuEpo treatment. Subjects in the PAD group will donate 1 unit of blood at -14 and -7 days prior to surgery. A dose of 500 IU of rHuEpo will be administered subcutaneously to subjects in the rHuEpo group at -21, -14, and -7 days prior to surgery.||The primary measure of efficacy will be the gain in red cell mass in each group prior to surgery. The proportion of patients in each treatment group requiring transfusion as well as other pre-operative, peri-operative and post-operative risks will be compared. Thirty days after discharge, a survey will be administered to gauge individual patient and family acceptance of the treatments.||Expected Results Among patients scheduled for scoliosis surgery, rHuEpo treatment can significantly lower the rate of transfusion. RHuEpo treatment may lead to improved outcomes, such as decreased length of hospitalization. However, the true significance in this project lies in the investigation of rHuEpo treatment as an alternative to the PAD program that is safer and more accessible to patients and their families.",Scoliosis

NCT03820895,"Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a major public health problem and despite its relative rareness, it reduces the quality of life. It is three-dimensional deformity where there is a lateral curving of the spine. The prevalence rate is 0.47-5.2%. The degree of the spinal curvature is evaluated by the Cobb angle. A Cobb angle of more than 10-15° is considered pathological. AIS occurs mostly in adolescents between 10 and 25 years of age, and is more prevalent among females.||Scoliosis is considered severe and requires surgical intervention when the Cobb angle exceeds 40o.||The etiology of AIS is still unknown. Genetic and non-genetic factors have been attributed to cause AIS. Among non-genetic factors is bone mineral density (BMD), as bone quality plays an important role in the derangement of bony mechanical stability. The prevalence of AIS with osteoporosis is approximately 20-38%. Osteoporosis is known to lower the bone strength.||Vitamin D plays an essential role in maintaining a healthy mineralized skeleton. It helps with calcium absorption, and patients with a deficiency of Vitamin D can have difficulties in producing new bone and maintaining their bone strength.||In this study, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency among patients with AIS was evaluated.

NCT04047225,"Anaesthesia is often performed using a balanced technique by administering both opioids and anaesthetics agents. Intraoperative opioid administration is still relying on simple parameters such as heart rate and blood pressure variations. However, many studies in both adults and children have shown the poor accuracy of those parameters in predicting pain because of their sensibility to other intraoperative events such as depth of anaesthesia and volaemic variations. Consequently, intraoperative analgesia is still inadequately managed with periods of under dosage or over dosage of opioid agents. This has been hypothesized to cause postoperative hyperalgesia related to both intraoperative pain (in case of under dosage) or to opioid agents (in case of over dosage). The main resulting effect is an increase of postoperative opioid consumption and the inadequate postoperative rehabilitation because of adverse effects of opioids.||During the last decade, many pain-monitors have been investigated. Most of these devices are relying on the determination of the sympathetic-to the parasympathetic systems balance. Among those monitors, the Analgesia Nociceptive Index (ANI) quantifies the parasympathetic system. The ANI device can produce two parameters the instantaneous ANI (ANIi), derived from 60 seconds analysis and the mean ANI (ANIm) derived from 4 minutes analysis. Studies have shown the accuracy of ANIi to detect both experimental and clinical pain in various populations. Moreover, a recent randomized controlled trial during spine surgery in adults has found ANIi to decrease the intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption when used intraoperatively for guiding the administration of opioid agents",Scoliosis

NCT03296228,"The Lenke Classification is the most widely-accepted classification for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) in the world. Its recommendations for fusion of the minor curves depend on its structurality. It defines a minor curve as structural if there is inflexibility on side-bending more than 25 . However, a recent Delphi survey from a panel of experts in AIS management showed that there was no consensus as to which type of dynamic radiograph was optimal. Up to two thirds of the surgeons did not use side-bending as a routine, and hence they cannot apply the Lenke Classification accurately in clinical practice nor follow its recommendations for fusion.||Furthermore, the current classification does not give specific recommendations regarding the selection of fusion levels and does not take into account the clinical appearance of the patients which impact on treatment. Consequently, there are still controversies regarding the Upper Instrumented Vertebra (UIV) and Lowest Instrumented Vertebra (LIV) selections, and following the recommendations may not allow fusion of the least number of segments nor give best clinical results eg shoulder balance.",Scoliosis
NCT02546479,"U.S. Scoliosis Cohort includes 5,573 female spinal deformity (93% scoliosis) patients diagnosed in any of 14 medical centers in the U.S. during 1912-1965. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate site-specific cancer risks associated with repeated low-dose radiation exposures from diagnostic x-rays. A secondary objective is to evaluate late mortality risks associated with patient characteristics, such as etiology, degree and type of curvature, and type of treatment. The current proposal is to extend mortality follow-up by 10 years. All patients not known to be deceased will be submitted to the National Death Index Plus to identify new deaths and obtain causes of death.||A feasibility study was conducted in four medical centers in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota area during 1983-1987. The primary goals of the feasibility study were to ascertain if an adequate number of patients meeting the study criteria could be identified and located, medical and radiography records were available and substantially complete, organspecific radiation doses could be estimated from the available data and were large enough to warrant further study, and a reasonable percentage of patients would complete a follow-up questionnaire. The feasibility study was successful in meeting all goals. Enrolled for study were 1,030 female patients with spinal deformities diagnosed during 1922-1965. Medical records were abstracted, individual x-ray films were reviewed, patients were located, and follow-up questionnaire was administered to identify incident cancers. Eleven breast cancers were reported. Scoliosis patients had an 80% higher breast cancer risk compared to women in the general population and, based on internal cohort analyses, breast cancer risk increased with increasing number of x-rays and with estimated radiation dose to the breast.||An expanded study was conducted during 1988-1993. The main goals of the expanded study were to enlist the collaboration of suitable additional medical centers where large numbers of spinal deformity patients were treated before 1966, abstract data from medical and radiology records, trace patients for vital status and current location, obtain information on incident cancers and cancer risk factors by questionnaire, medically validate reported cancers, and determine causes of death for decedents. Another 4,543 patients diagnosed during 1912-1965 were enrolled from ten hospitals, bringing the total study population to 5,573 patients. Compared to women in the general population, spinal deformity patients had statistically significantly higher risks of dying from breast cancer, and for both incidence and mortality, breast cancer risk increased with increasing diagnostic radiation exposure to the breast. Patients also have elevated risks for mortality from all causes, circulatory, respiratory, nervous system, musculoskeletal, digestive, and infectious & parasitic diseases, primarily related to degree of spinal curvature. Additional mortality follow-up will enable more definitive assessments of cancer and other disease risks with radiation and other factors in these patients.",Scoliosis

NCT02996643,"Background: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine associated with vertebral rotation. Brace treatment is the most commonly used non-surgical treatment. To obtain the best possible outcome, the best in-brace correction within the patient's accepted tolerance must be provided. However, in the existing clinical practice, the immediate in-brace correction cannot be measured during the design and fitting of the brace because the correction is determined using a radiograph.||Objectives: The objective of this study is to use ultrasound method to determine the optimum tolerable applied pressure level that can provide maximum in-brace correction.||Procedure:||Control Group: In the traditional method, each brace will be constructed using a plaster cast of the patient's trunk. Before the plaster cast hardens, the subject will lie on a casting board with multiple brace pads applied to correct the curve(s). The trim lines, pad placement, and areas of relief are then determined by the orthotist and guided by the curvature seen on the pre-brace PA spine radiograph.||Intervention Group: Before applying the plaster, subjects will lie on the custom designed frame. Two ultrasound scans will be performed and the average Cobb value will be used as the baseline. Multiple adjustable brace pads, each allowing for 6° of freedom and variable forces, will be applied to the patients' body according to orthotist suggestion. The apical brace pad that is used to control the major curve will be marked relative to the casting board as the reference location. The major pressure pad will be moved up 1 inch, then down 1 inch relative to the reference location. The 1 inch increment corresponds to the casting board, but finer adjustment is available. Two repeated ultrasound scans will be performed at each pad location (total 3 locations), and the average in-brace Cobb values will be estimated to determine optimum apical brace pad location. Next, pressure will be increased incrementally up to the tolerance level of the subject; this will be done by inflating the bladder at the apical brace pad. Another two ultrasound scans will then be performed to confirm that the maximum in-brace Cobb value is obtained. The orthotist will use this configuration to set the pad size and location once the plaster cast has been applied.",Scoliosis
NCT03904914,"Introduction||Accurate skeletal maturity assessment is important for prediction of curve progression and clinical management of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) including bracing decision and counseling for prognosis. Determination of the timing of peak growth height velocity and growth remaining are paramount important.1,2 Commonly used clinical or radiological methods are still inadequate or too complex for rapid clinical use in the outpatient setting.3-5 Risser sign had disadvantages of low visibility in PA spinal radiograph, wide variability with maturity level and imprecise representation of PHV timing.6 Greulich and Pyle atlas (GP atlas) and Tanner-Whitehouse-III (TWIII) method are more reliable and comprehensive classifications to predict maturity, but they are cumbersome and time consuming to be used clinically.7 Both methods require the usage of an atlas, a learning curve required for exact matching of atlas plate or assignment of scores to bones.8||Some latest skeletal maturity bone models were evolved trying to solve these problems but were still imperfect.9 Recently, Sanders made modifications to TWIII method to form Skeletal Maturity Scoring System (SMSS) which focused on epiphysis of small hand bones from all 5 digits. SMSS was proved to have excellent correlation with the curve acceleration phase.10 Digital skeletal age scores between 400 and 425 are associated with the beginning of the curve acceleration phase in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.11 Excellent intra-observer reliability and substantial inter-observer reliability among senior surgeons were demonstrated in SMSS.12||A new skeletal age classification has yet to be developed, although SMSS has considered a promising method. A recent study to test SMSS's reliability in less experienced staffs demonstrated average inter-observer reliability (K=0.53).8 It showed that a learning curve was present and several recommendations were added in each classification stage to avoid controversy and confusion during usage.13 Therefore, using SMSS requires an organized teaching system with detailed descriptions, self-assessment examinations, viewing presentations and the newly added recommended modification guidelines to improve the reliability. Another scoring system ""Distal Radius and Ulna (DRU)"" score simplified the measurement to just using radial and ulnar epiphyses but results observed that DRU score had the least correlation of ""Radio Ulna and Short bones"" (RUS) growth centers with scoliosis behavior.9,10 In addition, the variable appearance of ulnar epiphysis were difficult to be seen clearly.||In this study, the investigators introduce Thumb Ossification Classification Index (TOCI). TOCI employed the measurements of epiphysis of distal phalange, proximal phalange, and adductor sesamoid, and results were analyzed together to form a composite stage (composite score) to predict maturity in patient at their peripubertal period. Ultimately the application of TOCI should not be limited to IS patients only. After the establishment of TOCI classification system, the staging system would be applied to radiographs from patients without spinal deformity or suffering from diseases not related to spine.||The objectives of this study were as follows:||Measure different bony features at hand bones and classify the bony features to TOCI stages|Evaluate the TOCI system by comparing the measured TOCI stages with digital skeletal age (DSA) and radio ulna and short bones (RUS) scores|Evaluate the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of TOCI system",Scoliosis

Following surgery and during the growth period the spine begins to remodel according to the Hueter-Volkmann Law, bone growth is relatively inhibited in areas of increased pressure (convex or tethered side) and relatively stimulated in areas of decreased pressure or tension (concave side). Following this principle, AVBT has been shown to alter spinal growth with the potential to correct scoliosis while maintaining spine flexibility.||The objective of the study is to assess the ongoing safety and probable benefit of The Tether HUD which was approved by the FDA under an HDE. Subject enrollment and data collection will be managed by the Harms Study Group (HSG) and Setting Scoliosis Straight Foundation (SSSF) Registry.

NCT03915106,"Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a 3D deformity of spine happened with unidentifiable cause at teenage. AIS causes mainly cosmetic problems with a lesser incidence of functional deficit and pain. AIS patients under severe condition, defined as the major spinal curve angle named ""Cobb angle"" larger than 60 degrees, requires surgical intervention to the spinal curve with implants permanently applied along the spine. The use of ""brace"" (bracing) to intervene the spinal curve progression is highly recommended for patients with particular clinical characteristics. However, bracing is not always a present experience apart from function restriction. Clinical recommendation requires the patients to brace over 20 hours everyday, which means the patients have to be ""braced"" around the clock. Patients' perception on being ""braced"" all day, apart from discomforts under bracing, self-image and mental health after bracing are also important psycho-social factors which have yet to be addressed. Based on our clinical experience, 1-2% of AIS patients, undergoing bracing or not (i.e. at observation stage), require surgical intervention due to rapid spinal progression in a short period of time. By definition, surgery will be arranged for patients with major spinal curve ≥50 degrees.||The health-related-quality-of-life (HRQoL) questionnaires allow clinical professionals to explore many areas of interest, including the patient's perception of his/her condition and satisfaction with provided care.

Continuous monitoring of these factors are important along the bracing period to look for patients with continuously poor psycho-social status of which bracing period is possibly last for years. Apart from AIS patients requiring bracing, surgical cases are also very important group of patients to monitor their quality of life before and after surgery, and every follow-up visit after surgery.",Scoliosis
NCT02904421,"Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal deformity mostly affecting girls in the peri-pubertal period. Prevalence ranges from 2 to 4% in the general population. When the deformity becomes severe, serious morbidities can occur including early back degeneration, cardiopulmonary compromise, grossly deformed torso and associated psychosocial issues which could pose serious health threats for these young patients.||One important health threat that deserves special attention is osteopenia as defined by Bowden et al. for children having BMD age and gender-adjusted Z-score < -1. 30-38% of AIS girls were osteopenic. Osteopenia could persist across puberty and was found to be a significant and independent prognostic factor for curve progression in AIS. Osteopenia was also found to be associated with low dietary calcium (Ca) intake at a median of 400mg/day among AIS girls. The low Ca intake was significantly correlated with age-adjusted peripheral volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), as well as axial and peripheral areal BMD (aBMD) measured by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA).||Low calcium intake when coupled with low Vit-D status can seriously affect a child's bone health. Without Vit-D, only 10 to 15% of dietary calcium is absorbed, and 1,25-(OH)2Vit-D can increase intestinal calcium absorption to 30-40%. Vit-D insufficiency or disturbance in Vit-D physiology is associated with osteopenia, deranged muscle function and ligamentous laxity which could potentially predispose AIS subjects to curve progression.||Given that serum 25(OH)Vit-D level was also found to be low at a mean level of 41.6 nmol/L among AIS subjects, our group has conducted the first 2-year randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial using calcium and Vit-D supplementation for young AIS girls with low bone mass (the Cal study). There were three study groups in the trial, namely Group 1 (the placebo group), Group 2 (the low-dose treatment group with 600mg calcium + 400IU Vit-D3/day) and Group 3 (the high-dose treatment group with 600mg calcium + 800IU Vit-D3/day). The study showed strong evidences of positive bone accretion effects and therapeutic control of curve progression in groups with supplementation (Group 2 and 3). Following the therapeutic gain in BMD and improvement in bone quality with 2-year intervention with calcium and Vit-D supplementation, it will be important to evaluate if the effects persist after supplement withdrawal. This study would help to address this key issue by evaluating whether the beneficial effects of 2-year calcium and Vit-D supplementation persist at an average of 4 years after withdrawal of supplementation. The BMD, trabecular bone micro-architecture, bone strength, image-based and serum bone turnover parameters, and curve severity at 4 years after withdrawal of supplement would be compared with measurements done before and at end of supplementation.||Outcome of this study will provide important scientific data on the long term effects of 2-year calcium and Vit-D supplementation, thus justifying the need of lifestyle modification, duration and dose of supplementation for better bone health and curve control in adolescents suffering from AIS. If the beneficial effects are proven to be sustainable, the 2-year calcium and Vit-D supplements can be incorporated into the treatment protocol for AIS not only in Hong Kong, but also in Mainland China and other parts of the world; otherwise longer period of supplementation for sustained positive bone accretion effects and prevention of curve progression will be desirable for attaining peak bone mass and curve control to prevent osteopenia-related and scoliosis-related complications when approaching adulthood.||This six years longitudinal follow-up study with 2-year active supplementation period and 4-year post-withdrawal follow up for this cohort of adolescent girls is unique. Not only are the effects of calcium and vitamin D supplementation being followed, the placebo group in the original clinical trial provides the longitudinal changes on anthropometric, bone density, bone quality parameters and curve severity which will yield important reference information for local adolescents with AIS.",Scoliosis

PJK occurs in the form of fracture at the top vertebra involved in the surgery or as a loss of correction of spinal alignment achieved, through gradual bending forward of the spine over time.

Posterior Spinal fusion (PSF) for AIS is one of the most invasive orthopedic surgical procedures in children and adolescents, often characterized by a large surgical incision, extensive tissue trauma, risk of blood loss, longer operating times and severe postoperative pain. In addition to pain, the postoperative period is complicated by the side effects of opioids such as nausea and vomiting, itching and sedation. All of this can, along with under-treatment of postoperative pain, be an important delaying factor in postoperative recovery and rehabilitation with a late hospital discharge and increased patient dissatisfaction. Various studies have shown that pain in the direct postoperative phase is an important determinant for development of chronic post-surgical pain.||The consequences of untreated pain are known and can also contribute to chronification in pain.||The incidence of chronic post-surgical pain after scoliosis fusion is 22% at 6 months and 11-15% at 1 to 5 years postoperatively. It is therefore important to minimize the pain during the first postoperative days. Untreated pain in patients is far from benign with significant negative short and long term consequences with accompanying reduction in rehabilitation duration, sleep quality of life.

Radiographs of the spine in the A-P and lateral directions were taken with a digital radiographic imaging system (Saturn 9000 M, Comed., Korea). For each direction, the complete image of the spine was obtained from separate x-ray images of the upper and lower trunk due to the limited field of view of the x-ray machine.

NCT02206685,"Scoliosis is a disease that involves lateral and/or rotational deformity of the spine and can affect up to 4% of the population. Typically, surgery is considered when Cobb's angle, which is a measurement used for evaluation of curves in scoliosis on an anterior-posterior radiographic projection of the spine, is greater than 50 degrees in the thoracic region (40 degrees in the lumbar region) or when the curvature causes significant pain, or respiratory and cardiovascular restriction. Patient undergoing this surgical correction experience severe pain in the postoperative period and the management includes the use of opioid-based patient-controlled analgesia (PCA).||Methadone is an opioid with one of the longest elimination half-life and has been used as an effective analgesic for acute, chronic, neuropathic, and cancer pain in adults, children, and even neonates1-5. Its long duration of action and antagonism to the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor may decrease the need for PCA use in the postoperative period. Gourlay2 demonstrated the effectiveness and utility of perioperative methadone including the advantages of longer analgesia with no serious side effects of respiratory depression. A recent study by Gottschalk2 in adult patients demonstrated a 50% reduction of postoperative opioids at 48 hours and lower pain scores after a single bolus of methadone before surgical incision. However, a major weakness of the study is that patients did not receive equipotent intraoperative opioids. In addition, the adolescent patient population will undergo a much larger surgical incision with potential for greater postoperative pain. Despite this potential benefit, methadone is seldom used in the perioperative setting. A more recent pharmacokinetic study of methadone in adolescents undergoing spine surgery failed to show a reduction in opioid consumption as it was powered to determine pharmacokinetics and not a secondary endpoint of postoperative opioid consumption. An appropriately powered study is still required to determine the efficacy of methadone in reducing postoperative pain after spine surgery.",Scoliosis

NCT03329716,"The aims of this study are: 1) To compare the degree of Cobb angle and truncal balance maintenance between immediate removal and gradual brace weaning protocols for AIS patients who have completed brace treatment; 2) To determine factors for poor maintenance of Cobb angle and truncal balance after brace weaning; 3) To determine if the current standardized criteria for initiating brace weaning is appropriate; and 4)To identify the most cost-effective bracing weaning protocol from health-care provider perspective.||The investigators' hypothesis is that an AIS patient requires gradual brace weaning to allow better adaptation to an unloaded environment without the brace thereby resulting with a better truncal balance. It is also hypothesized that the immediate removal of brace for a AIS patient is more cost-effective option for terminating bracing treatment when compared to gradual brace weaning over a 6-month period.||The investigators will recruit AIS patients managed at the Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital (DKCH) in Hong Kong. As there is no definition for ""brace weaning"", we adopt the protocol that our center has been using. Hence the investigators will be comparing two protocols: 1) brace wearing time shortened to night wearing for 6 more months before stopping bracing altogether or 2) immediate brace weaning on the day of patient recruitment. All patients will be recruited on the day of clinic consultation where the decision for brace weaning is made. Those with underarm (Boston) bracing are included in the study. All subjects are followed-up longitudinally up to 1 year after brace weaning has been issued. Hence this includes two clinic visits with one at 6 months to complete the gradual brace weaning protocol and another at 1 year to observe for any delayed changes to the overall curvature and balance including loss of truncal balance and Cobb angle deterioration. For curve progression after brace weaning, the highest risk occurs within 6 months of brace weaning. Hence, 1-year collection of data is adequate for seeing differences between the two groups. This does not deviate significantly from our usual care as all AIS subjects are usually followed-up at 6-monthly intervals and thus this duration of follow-up is strictly adherent to and standardized.||Eligible patients who have consented to take part will be randomly allocated to one of the two protocols, and group designation will be decided by a computer-generated randomized table.

NCT03779581,"Kyphoscoliosis (KS) is the dual spinal deformity characterized by exaggerated thoracic kyphosis and lateral displacement of the spine in the frontal plane. Scoliosis is often associated with vertebral rotation. Scoliosis is the term used by Hippocrates, which means ""crooked"". Depending on the presence of lateral displacement scoliosis is classified into thoracic, lumbar or thoracolumbar. Idiopathic KS in adolescents is characterized by wedging of vertebral bodies in X-Ray and cardio-respiratory compromise.||Scoliosis is clinically diagnosed with 'Adam's test' by observing a posterior rib hump towards the convexity of scoliosis while bending forward in standing.||The severity of scoliosis is quantified by Cobb angle, which is calculated by drawing a line parallel to the end plates of the vertebral bodies at the starting and end of scoliotic curvature. The Second line is drawn a perpendicular to the first lines, the angle made between the intersection second lines is known as Cobb angle.||Clinical signs and symptoms of scoliosis become evident during the phase of rapid skeletal growth in children.

NCT03022656,"Background: Brace treatment is the most effective non-surgical method for the treatment of AIS. The goal of bracing is to stop the curve progression during the high risk period of the adolescent growth spurt. A spinal brace is a hard plastic shell with pressure pads installed inside the liner to provide mechanical support to the curvature of the spine. It is a big commitment for adolescents to wear a brace because it is physically restrictive, uncomfortable and draws unwanted attention. Therefore, it is very important to make the brace treatment as effective as possible to get patient buy-in to compromise their lifestyle by wearing a brace. Patients' belief in the treatment outcomes is also a factor to attain their compliance.||Study Objective: This randomized clinical study will investigate if the effectiveness of brace treatment can be maximized by combining ultrasound imaging assistance during brace design with the smart brace to automatically maintain corrective brace pressures at the optimum level during the whole treatment period.||Methodology:||Subject Selection: One hundred and twenty-eight brace candidates with AIS will be recruited over the next 5 years. During the scoliosis clinic, the attending orthopaedic surgeon identifies a potential candidate. He will ask the potential patient if he/she is interested in speaking with the research coordinator about research projects that he/she is eligible. The inclusion criteria are patients 1) age 10 - 16 years, 2) diagnosis of AIS, 3) require full-time brace wear, 4) Cobb angle between 20° - 40°, 5) Risser sign ≤3 and 6) premenarchal or less than 1 year postmenarchal. Subjects will be randomly selected to 1 of the 2 groups: a) An ultrasound assisted designed brace and a brace monitor, and b) An ultrasound assisted designed brace and a smart brace device. Figure 1 shows the flow chart of the study. Each subject will have 50% chance of being in any one of the groups. An extra 15 minutes will be needed for both groups during the brace fitting clinic to install the brace monitor or smart brace device. An extra 30 minutes will be added to your casting. Participants will be monitored until the brace treatment is finished.||Detailed description: The brace monitor is a small electronic device which will be embedded inside the brace. It is a very low power system operating at 3.3 V and 2 milliampere (mA) (on average). It is able to store 12 months of data and the battery can last for 9 months. It will record how much time and how tightly the subject wears the brace. The brace with the monitor looks exactly the same as a standard brace. The subject won't feel any different and don't need to do anything beyond. We will replace the monitor with a new one at every standard follow up clinic.||A smart brace device is a small electronic device. It will have a small air bag embedded at the major pad area covered with stretchable leather. It will record how much time and how tightly the brace is worn. The air bag will inflate if the contact pressure between the brace and the body is lower than expected. The air bag will deflate if the contact pressure between the brace and the body is higher than expected. This automatic pressure adjustment will only be activated during daytime which is individualized based on the patient's sleep pattern. The system will also be activated only if breathing motion is detected (which means brace is worn). The smart brace monitor is able to store 6 months of data but requiring to recharge every day for 30 minutes. The smart brace monitor is a low power system (operating at 4.2 V and 150 mA max). It has an on-off switch and a pressure enable-disable regulation switch safety functions. Switching enable-disable regulation to off will make the smart brace device becomes a standard brace monitor. Turing off the on-off switch will disable all the functions and this brace will become a standard brace. We will replace the monitor with a new one at every standard follow up clinic.||The ultrasound assisted design requires to get 4 ultrasound images: normal standing, normal supine, bending left supine and bending right supine. Each scan takes approximately 1 minute. These 4 scans will provide spine flexibility information. After this, the subject will be asked to stand in a wooden positioning frame with pressure pads allow to move 3-dimensionally. Multiple adjustable brace pads will be applied to the patients' body according to orthotist suggestion. An ultrasound scan will be performed after the pads are applied. The orthotist will use the ultrasound image to decide if the pads are at the optimum locations and applied proper pressures. If the orthotist is satisfied with the correction, he/ she will use this setup to build the brace. Otherwise, he/she will adjust the position and orientation of the pads and repeated the ultrasound scan.",Scoliosis

NCT00994656,"Spine fusion is an involved procedure during which patients are at risk for significant intra-operative blood loss. The resulting hypovolemia increases the fluctuations in arterial pressure associated with positive pressure ventilation. These respiratory induced arterial pressure variations (RIAPV) appear as cyclical peaks and troughs on the arterial waveform.||Different approaches have been used to quantify the RIAPV. One such approach has been to measure the pulse pressure variation (PPV), using invasive arterial monitoring. In previous studies, PPV has been shown to be a good indicator of fluid responsiveness intra-operatively, but this has not been specifically evaluated in patients undergoing spine fusion. This patient population is of particular interest because of their underlying scoliosis as well as their prone position during the operation. These two variables could potentially alter lung-thorax mechanics in a manner which may influence RIAPV, which is specifically determined by the interaction between intrathoracic pressure and venous filling of the heart. A second approach to quantifying RIAPV relies on non invasive technology initially developed by the Masimo Corporation for pulse oximetry. This parameter has been coined pleth variability index (PVI), as it specifically quantifies real time changes in the plethysmogram associated with respiration. PVI, which is based on arterial blood volume changes, is therefore analogous to PPV, which is derived from changes in arterial pressure. To date PVI has only been evaluated in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery and the data suggest that it may be a useful indicator of fluid responsiveness.||Given the non-invasive and continuous nature of PVI, it is appealing for potential use as a bedside monitor to guide fluid resuscitation. However, photoplethysmography is known to be sensitive to noise due to motion, light and electrical interference. Furthermore, PVI is based upon a degree of quantitative evaluation of the photoplethysmogram that is the first of its kind. For these reasons, it is important to understand the limits of agreement between PVI and PPV before we can accept PVI as a non-invasive surrogate measurement. This study intends to evaluate PVI by analyzing it in relation to PPV. More specifically, paired measurements of PPV and PVI will be compared to determine the limits of agreement between the two parameters in patients undergoing spinal fusion.",Scoliosis

NCT00357851,"We have shown an association between high intraoperative blood loss in children and young adults undergoing posterior spinal fusion and a subsequent clinical course characterized by a high rate of acute pancreatitis - a rare illness in children. Other complications include sepsis, deep wound infections, and prolonged length of stay. Although it has been reported in children and young adults with idiopathic scoliosis we have shown a significantly higher blood loss and rate of pancreatitis in patients with neuromuscular scoliosis, especially in cerebral palsy. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor, in reducing intraoperative blood loss and subsequent clinical pancreatitis and other associated complications in patients with cerebral palsy who undergo posterior spinal fusion. Aprotinin is currently approved for use in adults to reduce major blood loss during cardiac surgery, and it is used in children at virtually all major pediatric cardiac centers. In these populations, blood loss is consistently diminished by 50%. Safety and efficacy in adults and children is well documented, and use of this drug is familiar to most anesthesiologists. In addition, it has been shown to reduce blood loss effectively in large controlled-studies in adults who undergo major orthopedic surgeries, including spinal fusion. Recently one published study has also suggested that Aprotinin may reduced blood loss in children undergoing idiopathic scoliosis surgery, but the study did not have the adequately statistical power due to a small sample size. Since intraoperative blood loss and cytokine elevations are significantly correlated with the incidence of acute pancreatitis, we hypothesize a major role for ischemic injury in the development of pancreatitis and other complications. We expect that Aprotinin by reducing blood loss will prevent ischemic injury hence, decrease the incidence of acute pancreatitis in these children and young adults. While safety and efficacy have been established for cardiac surgery in adults and children, we propose to conduct a double-blind, randomized trial of Aprotinin in children with cerebral palsy who undergo posterior spinal fusion surgery to answer the following specific questions.||Specific Aim 1: To assess whether intraoperative Aprotinin infusion can reduce intraoperative blood loss, and whether this lowers the incidence of postoperative pancreatitis and associated complications of sepsis, wound infection and prolonged length of stay.||Specific Aim 2: To assess by indirect methods whether Aprotinin infusion can alter the degree of ischemic injury concomitantly with the reduction of blood loss and the incidence of postoperative pancreatitis.",Scoliosis

NCT00958581,"Study Design The study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blinded control trial. The patient, researcher, surgeon, and anesthesiologist will all be blinded to the patient's treatment. Patients will either receive TXA, EACA, or normal saline. The study will determine and compare differences in blood loss intra-operatively and estimate blood loss postoperatively through monitoring of subfascial Hemovac drain outputs at the incision site between the three groups. Postoperatively, laboratory values, drain outputs, and clinical outcomes will be carefully followed.||The primary goal of this study is to compare the efficacy of TXA to EACA to placebo in patients undergoing corrective spinal surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS), and with adult deformity (AD). Outcome measures will include intra-operative and perioperative blood loss, transfusion rates, complete blood counts, and coagulation profiles, as well as postoperative wound drainage, complications, and length of stay.||Standardized treatment protocol For EACA, the loading dose is 100mg/kg infused over 15 minutes, while the maintenance dose is 10mg/kg hr. For TXA, the loading dose is 10mg/kg infused over 15 minutes, while the maintenance dose is 1/mg/kg hr. Since TXA is prepared by pharmacy at a concentration ten times less than the concentration of EACA, the volume of medication administered during the loading and maintenance phase is identical. This is the ideal method for physician blinding and has been discussed in depth with the anesthesia department. The dosing regimen is also in accordance with existing guidelines and current literature. The literature also reports safely using TXA at a 100mg/kg loading dose followed by a 10mg/kg hr maintenance dose. However, improved efficacy at this higher dose of TXA has not been proven in a single orthopedic study. Since TXA is reported to be ten times more potent than EACA, delivering a dose of TXA that is ten times smaller than EACA is valid and well supported in the literature.||Surgical correction of the spine Dorsal lumbar access is achieved by a posterior lumbar skin incision along the midline. Paravertebral muscles are dissected away from bony structures taking care to achieve adequate hemostasis. Multi-level spinal osteotomies and/or releases of bony and ligamentous structures are performed to increase mobility of the spinal column. Bone grafts consisting of autologous bone or allograft are filled in to allow for bony fusion of the spinal column and limit motion. Pedicle screws are placed segmentally into vertebral bodies to provide adequate fixation of rod instrumentation. Stainless steel, titanium, or cobalt rods are placed to help correct and stabilize the spine while fusion occurs. Generally the greatest blood loss occurs during dissection and placement of pedicle screws while rod placement is associated with less blood loss. Subfascial Hemovac or Jackson-Pratt drains are placed at the wound site during closure to allow for adequate drainage and determination of post-operative blood loss.||Investigation schedule and follow-up Data will be collected pre-operatively regarding individual patient demographics, laboratory values, and the surgical procedure to be performed. Intra-operatively, data will be gathered to estimate blood loss and account for changes in fluid balance. Anesthesiologists are asked to maintain a MAP of 60 during the surgical exposure and anchor placement and a MAP of 70-90 during the surgical correction. Similarly, surgeons are asked to place only subfascial Hemovac drains at the incision site. These are both standard practice and have . Postoperatively, laboratory values, drain output, and clinical outcomes are carefully followed until the patient is discharged. Given the increased risk of renal failure with the use of Aprotinin changes in BUN to CR ratio are carefully monitored post-operatively. This data is recorded onto a de-identified data collection sheet by the researchers. These patient data sheets are then entered onto a protected electronic database, while the data sheets are stored as a back-up until the study is complete. Once the completed database is analyzed and summarized, the results will be presented to the involved participants without any identifiable patient information.||Statistical considerations While useful, this analysis is limited by the great variability in study design and control groups between prior orthopedic studies. Since no orthopedic study has compared TXA and EACA together, conducting a power analysis required pooling of data from two or three studies. This proved difficult, as control groups were dissimilar between the studies.||Power analysis was performed multiple times using data from several studies. When estimating the sample size required comparing TXA and EACA, attempts were made to choose two studies with similar intra-operative blood losses within the control groups. A cardiac study, albeit with dissimilar sample variance, was also used to estimate the sample size needed for this study. Finally, determining the sample size for outcomes of total blood loss and transfusion requirements proved difficult as even fewer studies reported these outcomes. Blood loss will be estimated in the operation room, but will also be calculated taking into account patient body mass, pre/postoperative hematocrit, and relative fluid balance. This will minimize the variance in reported blood loss. A power analysis will be performed again once 60 patients with AIS, NMS, or AD have been enrolled into the study.||With a single institution of surgeons and anesthesiologists participating in the study, we expect a smaller variation in operative blood loss than reported in prior studies. Data will not only be analyzed for all patients collectively, but will also be stratified by diagnosis (AIS, NMS, and AD). The purpose of stratifying into these groups is threefold. First, separation by diagnosis allows for more diligent control of patient-related factors that may affect blood loss and transfusion rate. Secondarily, stratification by diagnosis allows for a better understanding of which patients benefit most from one treatment option over another. Lastly, it allows for a broader application of the results from this study not only to patients with AIS, but to all spinal deformity patients.||An analysis of variance, univariate, and multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to analyze the difference in outcomes. Odds ratios will be calculated regarding the risk for autologous or allogenic transfusion both intra and postoperatively. P-values will be calculated regarding the relative blood loss in the intra and postoperative periods as well. The groups will be analyzed to characterize the homogeneity of their pre-operative characteristics that may influence blood loss. Patients with AIS, NMS or AD will be stratified by primary diagnosis and analyzed separately but also collectively accounting for patient and surgery-related confounders. Non-continuous data will be analyzed with a non-parametric test. Pre-operative curve characteristics including Cobb angle and number of vertebrae fused will be categorized to ensure similar groups for comparison.",Scoliosis

However, both studies were retrospective and did not evaluate any cost-savings associated with having two spine surgeons instead of one performing complex spine deformity surgery. With increasing scrutiny on the efficient use of health care dollars, it would be important to determine if there are any downstream cost savings to justify paying the surgeon fees of two spine attendings for these complex and high cost cases.||Most cost-effectiveness studies have used traditional accounting (TA) methods to determine costs. TA uses allocated expenses from the general ledger and payroll activity codes. These codes are derived from billable items and procedures entered into accounting software. Costs of services are grouped by cost types, across units of service.||A few cost-effectiveness studies have used time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) [Kaplan] in medicine [Au, Balakrishnan] and none in spine surgery. TDABC allows for detailed identification of costs during all phases of a patient's care cycle. While TDABC has been used in other industries, its use has been described only a few times in health care and rarely in the operative setting [Balakrishnan]. This may be due to the large amount of manpower necessary to collect TDABC data.||Objectives: The objectives of the study are (1) to determine if dual spine attendings reduce downstream costs compared to a single spine attending for complex spine surgeries using traditional accounting methods; and (2) to demonstrate an application of the TDABC method to evaluate the operating room phase during complex adult spinal deformity surgery and compare it to traditional accounting methods (TA).",Scoliosis
NCT02225444,"The objective of this clinical study are: to evaluate the long term efficacy of OsteoAMP in patients requiring 1 to 2 adjacent level, instrumented posterolateral spinal fusion procedure of the lumbar or lumbosacral spine, and to evaluate OsteoAMP in spinal fusion procedures based on fusion results, adverse event rates, and pain and health scores.||Patients that are scheduled to undergo instrumented, posterolateral spinal fusion (PLF) surgery as part of their medical treatment and comply with the study eligibility criteria will be recruited and entered into the study.

NCT04244760,"Improvement in the assessment techniques, to enable better pain management in children with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are unable to describe the intensity of the postsurgical pain, is a cornerstone of our research program. This research project will elucidate the regulation of specific markers of global surgical insult (nociception, inflammation, stress responses) associated to specific physiological mechanisms related to pain in children with and without verbal skills undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. This project creates a unique opportunity to directly characterize and compare MSK and surgical pain subjectively in the two different patient samples (verbal and non-verbal). As molecular events of pathophysiological processes are quantifiable, the investigators will test for associations between the expression of front-running pain biomarkers in physiological fluids (blood and saliva) and the experience of pain in two patient samples (verbal and non-verbal) undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. The identification of biomarkers will provide a deeper understanding of a patient's pain perception alongside self-report or observers' report subjective measurements. Even with standardization of best practice perioperative anesthetic pain management, children undergoing similar surgical procedures experience pain at different intensity. Based on preliminary findings, treatment modalities appear to be ineffective in one out of five patients. Pain experience variability may originate in the lack of rigor in the clinical pain assessment tools. Tools such as numerical rating scales used in the perioperative period are not based on objective patient specific pain thresholds. A personalized mechanism-based approach may be the key to better identify a patient's postsurgical pain outcome and how this assessment could lead to personalized perioperative pain management. The ultimate goal is to use this information to offer the highest quality of pain control in children with MSK conditions, and more specifically in children with limited communication skills unable to communicate their distress associated with the surgical procedures.",Scoliosis

NCT03494829,"Early Onset Scoliosis (EOS) defines patients who develop deformities of the spine and/or thorax in the embryologic development or in the early childhood. The exact prevalence of EOS in Norway is unknown, but it is assumed to be approximately 200-300 new EOS patients every year. EOS is a severe condition, whereby some of the most common and also most severe consequences of the deformity are severe pulmonary problems. The patients may require extensive orthopedic treatment from early childhood and until maturity to avoid serious consequences with severe pulmonary problems and shortening of life.||EOS' secondary problems, including severe consequences on the pulmonary function might contribute to enhanced inactivity. Inactivity contributes to further negative impact on development of the musculoskeletal system, motor competence and pulmonary function. Considering the severity of EOS and children's reduced life expectancy, it is extremely important that EOS children achieve the favorable impact of physical activity during their growth.

NCT04194996,"Adult cervical deformity (ACD) is an uncommon but potentially severely debilitating condition with a broad range of causes that include but are not limited to spondylosis, inflammatory arthropathy, trauma, infection, iatrogenic, neoplastic, congenital, and neuromuscular processes. In general, sagittal plane deformities typically produce kyphosis, and coronal plane deformities result in scoliosis. Cervical kyphotic deformities are most commonly encountered in the setting of prior surgical destabilization, while cervical scoliosis is most commonly associated with congenital and neuromuscular conditions.||Cervical kyphosis may be progressive and can result in neurological symptoms, including myelopathy. The most severe forms, such as those associated with spondylotic arthropathies, can produce ""chin-on-chest"" deformity, which can compromise horizontal gaze, swallowing, and breathing. Even in the absence of these conditions, cervical deformity is often associated with pain and functional disability. For adult thoracolumbar deformities, substantial efforts have been made to characterize clinical presentations, develop standardized classification systems, define optimal treatment approaches, describes operative complication rates, and to present structured clinical outcomes. However, despite the potential for profound impact of cervical deformity on function and health-related quality of life, there remains a remarkable paucity of high-quality studies that address these complex conditions.||Health professionals providing nonoperative and surgical care for these patients are left to make important treatment decisions based on a combination of personal experience, anecdotal experience of colleagues and experts, and relatively small, often single-surgeon or single-center, retrospective case reports or case series in the literature. Recent systematic reviews have high-lighted the lack of studies relevant to cervical deformity and have failed to identify any prospective studies.||The International Spine Study Group (ISSG) consists of orthopedic and neurological spine surgeons with a practice emphasis on spinal deformity patients. These surgeons, from 12 busy surgical centers, meet regularly to design and perform clinical research focused on spinal deformity, including successful prospective enrollment of more than 1,000 adult thoracolumbar deformity patients into the ISSG database. This group has a proven track record and regularly presents a substantial number of abstracts to the major spine meetings and has an extensive publication record.||The ISSG members have currently enrolled more than 150 patients into the first generation prospective cervical deformity database and have produced approximately 50 abstracts and more than 25 manuscripts to date with the resulting data. The group has learned extensively from this first-generation database, but there is much yet to learn, as the literature remains relatively sparse on the topic of adult cervical deformity. Based on what we have learned from the first generation database; we have substantially modified the inclusion criteria for this second generation database. In addition, several new outcomes measures and functional assessments will be collected at baseline and follow-up intervals as part of this current proposal.||The resources of the ISSG offer an unprecedented opportunity to create a prospectively collected multicenter database of cervical deformity patients that includes standardized health-related quality of life measures at baseline and regular follow-up, clinical and surgical parameters, and complications.

NCT02998138,"Safe and effective analgesia is an important unmet medical need in children. Despite efforts to promote non-pharmacologic interventions, drug treatment remains the standard of care for children experiencing severe pain following surgery. Inadequate pain relief after invasive surgery, and side effects from analgesics such as morphine occur frequently in up to 50% of children. A study of patient controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine use after spine surgery in adolescents observed a 45% incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and 7% incidence of respiratory depression. Presently, evidence-based dosing guidelines for opioid therapy have not been ascertained in the pediatric patient population, and remains a trial and error method. Despite aggressive pain management after spine surgery, findings showed that neither children's pain nor their analgesic use diminished significantly over time. As such, there is a critical knowledge gap in the medical literature that significantly impacts the pediatric pain management. Moreover, chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP, defined as pain attributable to the surgical procedure lasting for more than 2 months after surgery critically impacts 13-30% of children having surgery, and leads to chronic pain as adults imposing extraordinary annual costs on the health care system ($560-635 billion). It has been recently shown that pain unpleasantness predicts the transition from acute to moderate/severe persistent post-surgical pain, whereas anxiety sensitivity predicts the maintenance of moderate/severe post-surgical pain from 6 to 12 months after surgery. Spine fusion in adolescents is a particularly painful surgery with 15% incidence of pain even 5 years after surgery, and hence will serve as a good surgical model to evaluate the behavioral and genetic predictors of chronic postoperative pain. In recognition of this therapeutic challenge the investigators plan to evaluate the determinants of inter-individual differences in opioid analgesic responsiveness, adverse effects, pain perception and predictors of chronic postoperative pain in children.",Scoliosis
NCT01852747,"The current method for posterolateral lumbar fusion surgeries utilizes autograft bone typically derived from the patient's iliac crest. However, complications have been reported concerning the use of iliac crest bone, that include additional healing time due to the secondary surgical site and gait abnormalities. Clinicians are in need of an adequate alternative, and many have begun testing growth factors or synthetic compounds used in conjunction with local bone autografts. Though this avoids the need for a secondary surgical site, synthetic materials are not without their own limitations. These compounds must achieve similar growth and fusion rates as native bone. This study will test the applicability of Actifuse, a synthetic bone graft substitute, in instrumented multi-level adult spinal deformity surgery.||Actifuse is a silicate substituted calcium phosphate. It is osteostimulative, and is a bone void filler intended for orthopedic applications such as a filler for gaps and voids that are not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure. Actifuse has several features that mimic human bone (amount of silicon, resorption rate, etc). It provides a scaffold for long-term bone healing and is intended to be packed gently into bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system, i.e. extremities, pelvis and spine including use in posterolateral spinal fusion procedures with appropriate stabilizing hardware. These defects may be surgically created osseous defects or osseous defects created from traumatic injury to the bone. The product provides a bone void filler that is resorbed and replaced by native bone during the healing process.||Actifuse accelerates bone growth by combining an interconnected macro- and micro- porous structure with osteostimulative chemistry created through a patented silicate substitution process to attach and stimulate osteoprogenitor cells (OPCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). It resists irrigation and can be easily viewed on x-rays to monitor healing. Previous groups have shown that Actifuse is successful in the laboratory as well as in patients; however, previously reported literature has not studied the efficacy of Actifuse in instrumented multi-level adult spinal deformity.||Based on previous literature, investigators expect the Actifuse ABX to successfully fuse to native bone growth and promote fusion as well as an autograft replacement. Potential pitfalls include Actifuse not functioning as well in place of native bone. If this occurs, investigators will conduct revision surgery to ensure proper bone union.||The success of this project could have significant effects for the society at large. It is estimate that over 200,000 arthrodeses are performed each year, and the autologous iliac crest bone graft is often considered the standard of care, therefore these results could improve the outcome of surgery for thousands of patients every year. In addition, it will likely cut down on time the surgeon is in the operating room. It could also speed patient recovery by 1) lowering the amount of autologous bone harvested from the patient, and 2) taking advantage of the properties of Actifuse (osteostimulation, resorption rate, etc) that should result in quicker bone fusing and healing.",Scoliosis

NCT02761265,"Degenerative adult scoliosis results from age related changes leading to segmental instability, deformity and stenosis. Although the etiology is unclear, degenerative adult scoliosis is associated with progressive and asymmetric degeneration of the disc and facet joints, which typically lead to stenosis. By virtue of the narrowed spinal canal associated with the degeneration these patients frequently develop back pain, as well as leg pain, weakness, and numbness. With an aging population in the USA and an increased attention to quality of life versus cost issues in the current healthcare environment, degenerative adult scoliosis has become a considerable healthcare concern.||Patients with scoliosis demonstrate an altered gait pattern. Such differences include decreased step length and reduced range of motion in the upper and lower extremities, asymmetry of trunk rotation and ground reaction force in three-dimensions. Mahaudens et al. found a decrease in the muscular mechanical work associated with an increase of energy cost and a decrease in the muscular efficiency in a scoliosis population compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, scoliosis patients exert 30% more physical effort than healthy subjects to ensure habitual locomotion, and this additional effort requires a reciprocal increase of oxygen consumption. This altered gait pattern demonstrated by subjects with scoliosis may be due to changes in global postural control strategies caused by spinal deformity.||Previous research showed that scoliosis patients do not have impaired postural balance when compared to healthy controls, while several others did find an effect of scoliosis on postural balance. This discrepancy in findings may be due to differences in curve characteristics included and their effects on postural balance, curve types (single or double), number of different curve types, location of curves (thoracic and lumbar), and/or Cobb angles. Furthermore, Schimmel et al. found that postural balance one year after surgery did not improve as a result of the better spinal alignment, neither did the reduced range of trunk motion inherent to fusion negatively affect postural balance.||While medicinal interventions may assist with some of the associated co-morbid conditions, surgical interventions may be indicated for those patients with intractable and debilitating low back and leg pain. These surgeries have proven to be extremely successful in a majority of patients. The surgeries may involve decompression and instrumentation to stabilize the spine to achieve arthrodesis.||Surgical intervention may provide pain relief and improvement in function but one area of significant clinical interest is the restoration/improvement in gait and functional balance. Based on the investigators knowledge, there is limited literature on biomechanics and neuromuscular control of the lower extremities and spine as assessed by objective gait analysis and balance strategies in adult degenerative scoliosis patients, pre and post surgical intervention. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of spinal deformity on the biomechanics and neuromuscular control of the lower and upper extremities, and also investigate the impact of surgery on these functions as evaluated by gait and balance analyses using dynamic Electromyograph (EMG), video motion capture and force plate analysis and also to compare these patients with healthy controls to better evaluate the extent of limitations before and after surgery.",Scoliosis

NCT04547647,"The anterior and posterior curves of concavity are part of the physiological position of the spinal column, and are represented by cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, and new sacral and coccygeal kyphosis. Despite all these curves, the spinal column should work mechanically as a straight and rigid axis to withstand stress, and should be functionally flexible in order to allow movement. This mix of opposite behaviors (rigidness and flexibility) is the result of a complex stabilization system formed by muscles that contract and relax harmonically and absorb any impact exerted on the spinal column structure. Biomechanically speaking, the spinal column influences and is influenced by positioning and stress of the pelvic and scapular belts, and upper and lower limbs, respectively. Postural deformities and alterations should not be evaluated only in terms of bone structure, but also in terms of the functional assembly represented by the spinal column [2].||Adolescence is a stage of fast physical development in which the nervous system and musculoskeletal system have yet to fully develop.

NCT03319563,"The most frequently loco-regional analgesic techniques in scoliosis surgery are intrathecal, epidural, caudal morphine, or local infiltrations techniques including ultrasound guided thoracolumbar interfascial plane block. however these techniques possess some limitations in scoliosis surgery. Local anesthetic infiltration was first applied over 35 years ago in lumbar spine surgery as a reliable technique for pain relief. However meta-analysis of data reviled inconclusive and heterogeneous efficacy results.This conflict arise from the differences in the technique and drugs.There are three levels of infiltration; subcutaneous, muscular and perineural. Its timing either pre-incision or post-surgery. Generally the preemptive and deep infiltration offer better analgesia when compared with post-surgical and superficial forms. Different drugs including local anesthetics, epinephrine and adjuvants can be given as a single injection or infusion. Doses and volumes are also different, usually ranging from 10 to 30 ml at a concentration of 0.25% Bupivacaine. the use of epinephrine helps bleeding control Concomitantly, unlike the other techniques, bupivacaine infiltration was combined at three levels in this study; subcutaneous, muscular and neural paravertebral to provide sensory, motor and sympathetic blockade all together.

NCT04115202,"Lower back pain is the leading cause of disability in France for adults under 45 years of age. It is also the leading cause of work stoppage and reported occupational illnesses. Thus, the degenerative pathologies of the lumbar spine can be at the origin of a severe handicap resistant to well-conducted medical treatment. This is particularly the case for degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritic spondylolisthesis and scoliotic dislocations in adults.||If lumbar arthrodesis is a recognised solution in the surgical treatment of degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine when they become disabling despite medical treatment, the choice of the operative technique and approach used to achieve it is more dependent of the training that the practitioner benefited from than the guidelines derived from published prospective comparative scientific studies comparing the results of different surgical solutions.||Our hypothesis is that the functional and radiographic results of anterior lumbar arthrodesis techniques by minimally invasive approach may differ from those of conventional posterolateral arthrodesis.||We propose to compare the results of these two surgical techniques within the orthopedic and neurosurgeon team of the Institut Parisien du Dos, mastering these two approaches optimally by leaving them free to use them as they do daily without modifying their procedures.

NCT03559244,"Pectus carinatum (PC) is a deformity of the anterior chest wall which is a common pediatric condition, characterized by an idiopathic overgrowth of the costal cartilages resulting in protrusion of the sternum. There are two subtypes of PC: the chondro-gladiolar variant, which is the most common type, and presents with protrusion of the sternal body, and the chondro-manubrial variant, showing protrusion of the component of the sternum (manubrium). PC usually involves the lower sternal costal cartilages, pushing the sternum forwards and can be symmetrical (bilateral) or often asymmetrical (unilateral) with the right for some reason being more obviously affected. PC may occur as a solitary abnormality or in association with other genetic disorders or syndromes (eg, trisomy 18, Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria, Morquio syndrome, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). Of the musculoskeletal abnormalities, scoliosis is most frequently associated with PC.||Chest pain or discomfort, especially when lying in prone position, increased respiratory effort during exercise, scoliosis, impaired shoulders and kyphotic position are some of the physical signs and symptoms. Unlike pectus excavatum, PC is rarely associated with significant cardiopulmonary involvement except in severe cases. Pectus carinatum is not just a simple aesthetical problem. It can be responsible of physical signs and symptoms and also has significant psychological impact. Deformity and its psychological impact tend to worsen during pubertal rapid phases of growth and even during adult life. It has been demonstrated that patients with PC are at risk for a disturbed body image and reduced quality of life and many patients refer feelings of discomfort, shame, shyness, anxiety, and even depression.||The classical management of pectus deformities, both carinatum and excavatum, has been primarily surgical. Modification of the Ravitch technique involves resection of the deformed costal cartilages along with sternal osteotomy. Because the results of this technique resulted in worse cosmetic results, a new less invasive procedure, the Nuss procedure was developed. Nuss procedure includes remodeling of the chest wall cartilage with an internal support bar. These techniques have demonstrated the plasticity of the chest wall and led clinicians to hypothesize that carinatum defects would also remodel in response to chronic pressure, leading to a cosmetically superior, nonoperative technique: compression brace. Compression brace is a dynamic orthosis which is custom-fitted, rigid aluminum brace that is adjustable to any thoracic shape. Complications of brace use include uncommon (4.6%), mild and easy to resolve: back pain, hematoma and skin ulceration. Pressure of correction is the pressure applied to the patient, in the most protruding area of the chest, needed to accomplish a proper shape of the thorax. It is an indirect parameter of the chest wall's flexibility. It can be measured with a pressure measuring device in pounds per square inches (PSI). Some special designed braces contain a part in which pressure measuring device can be docked. This enables measuring of pressure of treatment. Pressure of treatment can be different from pressure of correction since skin breakdown occurs with corrections at high pressure.||In the Calgary protocol, wearing brace 23 hours a day during the correction phase until the development of the axial skeleton is completed and afterwards 8 hours of wear is recommended in the continuation phase.Martinez-Ferro et al developed pressure measuring device and special designed braces contain a part in which pressure measuring device can be docked. They suggested that patients with pressure of correction <10 should be braced. De Beer et al. also recommended the surgical treatment in the presence of chondro-manubrial type PC and pressure of correction > 10 PSI. However, recommendations are based on prospective or retrospective cohort studies other than randomized controlled trials which corresponds to low level of evidence.||Despite the fact that patients with PC have impaired posture, exercise intolerance and increased scoliosis occurrence, there is no consensus on the exercise program for patients with PC. Postural impairment aggravates psychological burden caused by disease itself. Patients with pectus carinatum may get benefit from exercises to improve posture. Also, disease itself or compression brace use may result in abdominal flare and increased lateral diameter of chest wall as an unwanted effect. Strengthening of abdominal muscles may prevent from abdominal flare. Strengthening of chest wall muscles, strengthening the pectoralis and sacrospinalis muscles as well as expanding the chest through deep breathing, strengthening core muscles including abdominal muscles, increasing flexibility of muscles, manipulation and mobilization of costae may lead improvements in the management of PC.||There is no consensus about exercises, and there is not enough scientific evidence about the wear time of orthosis. The existing treatment protocols are non-standardized protocols developed by the researchers of previous studies investigating the effectiveness of orthosis. Martinez-Ferro et al., the developer of the dynamic compression brace, recommends the daytime wear of orthosis for patients with low pressure of correction. They recommend duration of clothing to be shorter and the pressure of treatment should be kept lower in patients with high pressure of correction. However, every compression brace may not contain dock and pressure of treatment cannot be measured. In the present study we aimed to investigate the effects of exercises and compression brace in children with PC. Also, safety and feasibility of the orthosis will be evaluated. Patients with chondro-gladiolar, symmetrical or asymmetric, compressible PC (compression test positive) and with correction pressure ≤10 PSI, aged 5-18 years old will be included to study. They will be randomized to three groups using closed envelope system. All groups will be given exercises to strengthen the muscles of the respiratory muscles of the posture exercises, deep breathing exercises, ribs manipulation and mobilization exercises and core exercises for 1 hour a day, five days a week for 3 weeks. The first group will use the orthosis for 8 hours during the night and the second group for 23 hours except for sports activities, exercise and bath. The control group who will receive exercise therapy only will be selected from the wait-in list for the orthosis.

NCT03178708,"Instrumentation in correction operations for spinal deformities as vertebral fusion, congenital and traumatic scoliosis, carries a 0.5-5% risk of injuring the spinal cord during spinal surgery.||These complications are generally results of complex factors such as direct effects of compression on the spinal cord, distraction, the effects of spinal ischemia or arterial hypotension.||The purpose of the wake-up test is to monitor voluntary motor function of the lower limbs once the vertebrae have been instrumented and distracted. The depth of anesthesia is gradually lightened up to the point where patients are able to respond to verbal commands. As the voluntary movement of lower extremities is demonstrated, the depth of anesthesia is increased to complete the surgery.",Scoliosis
NCT04637802,"Major musculoskeletal surgeries are associated with particularly high prevalence of both acute and chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP), with 80% of youth reporting intense acute pain after hospital discharge, and up to half reporting CPSP up to one year after spine surgery. Interventions to improve recovery and reduce pain after surgery have potential to interrupt a negative trajectory of suffering and disability associated with chronic pain. Our specific aims are: Primary: (1) Determine effectiveness of a pre-operative mHealth psychosocial intervention to improve acute pain outcomes in adolescents undergoing major musculoskeletal surgery, (2) Determine effectiveness of a post-operative mHealth psychosocial intervention to improve chronic pain outcomes at 3 months in adolescents undergoing major musculoskeletal surgery, (3) Determine the combined effects of pre- and post-operative psychosocial intervention on chronic pain outcomes.

NCT04167800,"A chest wall deformity is a structural abnormality of the chest that can range from mild to severe. Chest wall deformities occur when the cartilage that connects the ribs grows unevenly. It is not clear why this happens, but the condition tends to run in families. The two most common types of chest wall deformity are Pectus excavatum and Pectus carinatum, Pectus carinatum goes far beyond a simple esthetical problem. It can be responsible of physical signs and symptoms and also has significant psychological impact. Defects tend to worsen during pubertal growth spurts and even during adult life. Recent evidence shows that these patients are at risk for a disturbed body image and reduced quality of life and many patients refer feelings of discomfort, shame, shyness, anxiety, anguish, and even depression, which can lead to social isolation. Chest pain or discomfort, especially when lying in prone position, intolerance to physical exercise, scoliosis, impaired shoulders and kyphotic position are some of the physical signs and symptoms.Non-invasive treatment approaches for PC include compression orthosis and exercises that target the deformity itself and concurrent postural impairment and scoliosis. In addition, the formation of muscles can help close the deformity. Most evidence of non-invasive treatment is retrospective or prospective case series. In a prospective case series, patients were instructed to perform chest wall strengthening exercises, but the effects of the exercises were not investigated . Although, exercise training is recommended, there is no randomized study showing its effectiveness in the literature. Therefore, in our study, the investigators aimed to investigate the effectiveness of exercise therapy in addition to compression orthotics.",Scoliosis
NCT01977937,"Patients aged 10-19 years with idiopathic scoliosis, and classified as American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class I to III who intended to undergo posterior spinal fusion for deformity correction were enrolled. Prior to surgery, subjects were randomized into either the experimental or control group by the OHSU research pharmacy using an online randomization tool, which utilized block randomization upon patient enrollment to result in equal sized groups at study completion. Patients, caretakers and providers remained blinded to the group assignments.||Patients filled out the Scoliosis Research Society, SRS-22 standardized form at a pre-operative clinic appointment. Following hospital admission, patients recorded initial pain level with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) prior to receiving standardized pre-operative medications. The VAS scale used in this study was a 10 cm line with anchors of ""no pain"" at the left and ""worst pain imaginable"" at the right; each point was measured to the nearest millimeter. In the post-operative period, nursing staff assessed patient pain using the VAS at 4-hour intervals from 06:00 until 22:00 for the duration of hospitalization for a minimum of 4 daily scores recorded per patient. After the third post-operative day, but before discharge, the parent or guardian of each subject was asked to complete an IRB-approved survey to measure parent demographics and parental satisfaction with the patient's hospitalization and pain control.||Each patient received standardized medications according to our multimodal pain protocol. Following hospital admission, patients in both groups received one 12.5 mg/kg dose of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen. Patients in the experimental group received one 15 mg/kg dose of liquid gabapentin while the control group received a placebo, formulated to match the volume, color, taste, and smell of the experimental medication. The gabapentin or placebo was prepared by the OHSU research pharmacists so that providers and investigators remained blinded to treatment assignment. Several intraoperative anesthetic medications were given to subjects in both groups including: IV ketamine at 5mcg/kg/min for 120 minutes and IV Ketorolac 0.5mg/kg up to 15mg. Intra-operative IV propofol and IV hydromorphone were titrated to desired effect.In the post-operative period, gabapentin was administered to the experimental group at 10mg/kg PO q8h, beginning at Phase II and continued through postoperative day four. The control group received equivalent volume doses of placebo at the same intervals. Post-operative medication was administered according to the following protocol for both groups: ketorolac continued at 0.5mg/kg up to 15mg IV q6h for 12 total doses. Once ketorolac doses were complete, the patient may have received Ibuprofen 10mg/kg up to 600mg PO as needed. Hydromorphone was given through patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) at a basal dose of 0.002mg/kg/hr for 24 hours and demand dose of 0.004mg/kg with an 8-minute lockout. Once basal PCA was discontinued, administration of oxycodone 0.1-0.2mg/kg PO up to 15mg PO q4h as needed supplemented the PCA demand dose. If the patient tolerated PO oxycodone without emesis, the PCA hydromorphone was discontinued after 24 hours, but a rescue dose of hydromorphone 0.002mg IV q4 was available if needed. Other as needed medications included diazepam 0.15mg/kg up to 5mg PO q6h for muscle spasms, ondansetron 0.1mg/kg up to 4mg IV q12h for nausea, and IV acetaminophen 12.5mg/kg up to 1000mg q6h. Acetaminophen 12.5mg/kg up to 650mg PO q6h hours was administered after the IV was removed. All patients received one Senokot-S tablet and Miralax 0.8 g/kg up to 17g daily for bowel regimen.||For the entire hospitalization, nursing staff monitored vital signs and assessed sedation using the standardized Pasero Opioid-induced Sedation Scale (POSS) protocols at 4-hour intervals.16 Any POSS score of 3 or greater resulted in more frequent monitoring of respiratory status and sedation level, decreased opioid dosing, and administration of naloxone as needed. All patients were routinely monitored for known adverse gabapentin drug reactions including: peripheral edema, nausea/emesis, viral disease, ataxia, dizziness, nystagmus, somnolence, hostile behavior, fatigue and fever, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug hypersensitivity reactions, drug induced coma/seizure, and suicidal thoughts. Any perceived adverse reaction would have resulted in the gabapentin or placebo being stopped at the clinicians' discretion",Scoliosis
NCT00596609,"Posterior spinal fusion surgery (PSF) is associated with significant postoperative pain. Numerous postoperative pain management strategies have been employed for patients undergoing these procedures, including continuous narcotic infusions, intravenous patient-controlled opioid analgesia, epidural analgesia, intrathecally administered narcotics, and combinations of these regimens. Most patients at CHOP have their pain managed with intravenous patient-controlled opioid analgesia alone or in combination with a single dose of intra-operatively administered intrathecal (IT) morphine.||Patients undergoing spinal fusion procedures are also at risk for perioperative neurologic injury. Surgeons at CHOP and other institutions routinely utilize neurophysiologists to evaluate at-risk neural pathways to identify impending spinal cord and spinal nerve root injury. These consultants monitor motor and sensory pathways by recording and analyzing evoked potentials and electromyography during the operation. Evoked potentials are low voltage electrical signals generated in response to transcranial or transcutaneous electrical stimulation of motor and sensory nerves.||At CHOP, IT morphine is injected by the surgeon after the scoliotic curvature has been corrected and spinal instrumentation is complete. This injection therefore occurs after the critical period for neurophysiologic monitoring and risk of spinal cord injury. It is injected after the neurophysiologist has given a reassuring assessment of neural integrity. This injection is given to patients who have spinal fusions extending below the second lumbar vertebral body. Injections are limited to this group of patients because the appropriate intervertebral spaces for intrathecal injection are not exposed in procedures that do not extend below this level.||Most commonly used anesthetic agents have well-characterized effects on evoked potentials. The effects of IT morphine on sensory-evoked potentials have been studied. However, little data exist on its effects on transcranial electric motor-evoked potentials. This study aims to characterize these effects; we hypothesize that intrathecal morphine has no effect on transcranial electric motor-evoked potentials in the doses used at our institution.",Scoliosis

NCT04674618,"Background Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) capable of increasing SMN protein production, has been used in clinical trials in infants and children with SMA type 1 or type 2 and has been associated to a significantly better motor development, motor function, and survival compared with placebo groups1,2. Because of the lacking ability of ASOs to cross the blood-brain barrier, nusinersen is administered intrathecally3. While most infants with SMA type 1 die in easy childhood without a muscular and nutritional support, SMA type 2 patients often reach adulthood, and patients with SMA type 3 generally have a normal lifespan4,5. A further feature of SMA patients is a progressive neuromyopathic scoliosis, so spinal nusinersen administration can be challenging because of poorly palpable surface landmarks, as in elderly and in obese patients6-9. In patients with anticipated difficult anatomy, the failure rate of neuraxial anesthesia may be as high as 17%7,10,11. Furthermore, multiple needle punctures are associated with hematoma, post-dural-puncture headache, back pain, and patient dissatisfaction7,12. Current data suggest that landmark identification using a pre-procedure ultrasound (US) is a useful adjunct to neuraxial anesthesia8-10 that facilitates technical performance in obstetric13-15 and pediatric patients. In adult patients with difficult spinal anatomy16,17 a pre-procedure US reduces the number of attempts18 and the number of needle passes necessary for successful spinal anesthesia18 and can predict technical difficulty16,19; notably, compared to fluoroscopy, sonography allows for the elimination of radiation exposure for patient and physician and for a cost reduction for institution. Despite these potential advantages, reports of lumbar central neuraxial blocks US guidance in patients with predicted placement difficulties are limited. Most reports to date involve a small number of patients with normal anatomy16,20-23.||Methods The study will be conducted in Fondazione Policlinico ""A.Gemelli"" operatory rooms, Rome, Italy. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients enrolled in the study. SMA adult patients referring to NEMO center of this institution will be enrolled. Exclusion criteria will be: coagulation defects, patients medicated with anticoagulation, any finding of infection in puncture site, high intracranial pressure. A visit will be performed before the procedure.||Patients will be randomly assigned in ratio 1:1 to one of two groups using a sealed envelope: Group 1 (US-assisted nusinersen administration) and Group 2 (landmark based nusinersen administration). Nusinersen administration will be performed with a single-operator technique by one of two anesthesiologists trained on US-guided or -assisted central neuraxial blocks. With patient in sitting position, or in lateral position if forced posture will be needed, after skin disinfection with 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol, the spinal administration will be performed as follows: Group 1 (US- guided nusinersen administration). The paramedian sagittal oblique view will be used to identify specific lumbar interspaces and perform the procedure. Starting at the sacrum and moving cephalad, the L2-3 or L3-4 intervertebral interspace will be identified. After local anesthesia with lidocaine 2% (3-5 mL), a 25-gauge Withacre spinal needle will be used to identify subarachnoid space. After confirmation of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and after removing 5 ml of CSF, nusinersen will be administered intrathecally over 1-3 min. Group 2 (landmark based nusinersen administration).||The desired intervertebral space (L2-3 or L3-4) was first identified by manual palpation of surface landmarks and marked on the skin. After local anesthesia with lidocaine 2% (3-5 mL) a 25-gauge Withacre spinal needle will be used. After confirmation of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and after removing 5 ml of CSF, nusinersen will be administered as previously described. After successful administration, patients will be positioned in the supine position for 2-3 h. Within 72 hours of administration a phone survey will be conducted to evaluate the development of postdural puncture headache. Another outpatient visit will be performed at 30 days after the procedure.||References||Finkel RS, Mercuri E, Darras BT, et al.

NCT00056186,"Human development across the lifespan is a process of continual change, adaptation and growth. Throughout this process, key transitional events, such as career choice and marriage, mark important points in time when an individual's life course is significantly altered. These transitional events may be instigated by age, historical or idiosyncratic factors. Of particular interest in the present study are patients' perceptions of transitional events brought about or altered by chronic illness and disability. Additionally, factors (i.e. social support, communication, family) that help facilitate progression through these events will be investigated. The actual or potential role of health care providers during transitional events will also be explored with a specific emphasis on genetic counseling. These themes will be examined through the administration of a one-time, semi-structured, in-person or telephone interview of patients with Friedreich's ataxia: a progressive, debilitating, neurodegenerative condition. The interviews will be approximately 45-60 minutes in length and will include open-ended questions to elicit qualitative data. Approximately 40 subjects will be recruited from Friedreich's ataxia support groups, a research organization and a clinical setting.||It is anticipated that data elicited from the study will lead to recommendations regarding the process and content of genetic counseling for individuals with Friedreich's ataxia. These considerations, coupled with qualitative data obtained from participants, may also have implications for the evolving role of the genetic counselor.

NCT00912119,"Craniosynostosis is the condition in which there is premature fusion of one or more of these sutures between the bones of the skull. Craniosynostosis limits the ability of the cranial vault to expand to accommodate the rapidly growing brain in infancy and early childhood. Deformation of skull shape results as cranial vault expansion occurs in areas of the skull that have not abnormally fused. Left uncorrected, craniosynostosis may adversely impact neurologic and psychosocial development. In some cases, increased intracranial pressure may also result.||Craniofacial (CF) reconstruction procedures to treat craniosynostosis are undertaken in young children to improve appearance, prevent functional disturbances, and enhance psychosocial development. Optimal surgical results are achieved when these procedures are performed in infancy. These procedures are extensive, often requiring wide scalp dissections and multiple osteotomies and have been associated with significant morbidity. Reported complications include massive blood loss, intraoperative cardiac arrest, transfusion reactions, venous air embolism, hypotension, coagulopathy, bradycardia, postoperative seizures, surgical site infections, facial swelling, and unplanned postoperative mechanical ventilation (7-13). Many of the most severe and commonly seen problems are associated with the rate and extent of blood loss.||Intraoperatively, the presence of hyperfibrinolysis has been demonstrated in children undergoing CF reconstruction procedures (8,14), although the extent of its contribution to bleeding is unclear.||Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA), another inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is an attractive alternative.

NCT04536909,"Detailed description 1 Indications and Treatment of Adult Kypho- Scoliosis (INTRAKS Study) 2. Background:New surgical techniques for osteotomies and promising equipment has led to a renaissance with broader indications, evoking the need for well-founded studies and quality registration of the adult kyphoscoliosis treatment to evaluate the risk of major complication, the benefit for the patients and socioeconomic burden. Prior randomized studies have had high crossover rates to surgical treatment, questioning the result of the studies. As a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be difficult, the investigators plan to propensity match two cohorts and then compare the correctional surgery and non- surgical treatment at a 1 year follow-up.||2.1 Needs description: Following are challenges that still remain to be addressed:||Identify predictors for unsatisfactory outcome in adult kyphoscoliosis. This study aims to create a predictive model for unsatisfactory outcome after deformity surgery in adult kyphoscoliosis. A prospective multicenter observational effectiveness study is constructed to detect a < 30% improvement from baseline in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score at 12 months follow up. The predictive model can be a helpful tool in accessing the complexity of this patients and aid in shard decision making and improved surgical planning. Patients are grouped in: 1) unsatisfactory result (UR) < 30% increase from baseline ODI score, 2) satisfactory result (SR) ≥ 30% increase from baseline ODI score. A predictive model will be calculated for both kyphosis and scoliosis together and separately. The same criteria for inclusion are set in the non-surgical group as well as all the data collected, a predictive model will be created if the difference in outcome is significant. The investigators will also look at the patients with a > 10% worsening from baseline in ODI score at 12 months follow up.||A prospective multicenter observational effectiveness study of adult kyphoscoliosis treatment, surgical and non-surgical outcome with a 12 months follow up.||This part of the study will be looking at the effectiveness of surgery vs non-surgical treatment using the PROMS described in the protocol. It is outcome related, the planned follow up time is 12 months, but the investigators have ethical approval (REK) to continue the data recording for 24 months and more for a sufficient follow up time. It exceeds the time limit for the PhD candidates listed, but others will continue the work. It will contain all the patients included.|The subgroups of iatrogenic/degenerative kyphosis and scoliosis will be studied separately as it is known that the mainly scoliotic patients do better than the kyphotic once. Around 30-40 patients will be sufficient in each surgical subgroup, the same in the non-surgical.|The kyphotic healed high energy fracture. One of the subgroups to be investigated is the high energy fractures healed in kyphosis. High energy fractures are typical males in the age of 25-50. The fractures healed in kyphosis with a regional kyphotic angle of >20 degrees and a positive sagittal vertical axis of >4 cm can be included (the rest of the inclusion or exclusion criteria listed will be followed as for the whole study). As this is a subgroup, around 30-40 surgical patients will be sufficient. The investigators hope to have the same number in the non-surgical group to compare with. The main outcome parameter is ODI, but the investigators will also look into the results of the EQ-5D, SRS22 and the numeric rating scale (NRS). As this is a fracture resulting in a secondary deformity, the PROMS listed should be addressing the patient problems.||XLIF vs anterior-/transforaminal interbody fusion/pedicle subtraction osteotomy/Smith Petersen/Ponte (ALIF/TLIF/PSO/SP/Ponte).||There is a trend towards using XLIF and OLIF procedures for deformity cases. The investigating party will look into the patients operated using the lateral approaches and compare it towards the dorsal applied interventions (TLIF, PSO, Ponte/SP), if possible also ALIF patients. It should be at least 30-40 patients undergoing the lateral intervention to be able to make a comparison that could be statistical significant.||Socioeconomic study; surgery vs non-surgical for adult kyphoscoliosis. The correctional surgery is often of long duration with expensive implants and highly complicated with high risk of complications. It is costly and the investigators intend to evaluate the socioeconomic burden. The duration of surgery, cost of implants and duration of hospital stay will be registered, the readmission due to complications will be registered for the first 12 months. As EQ-5D is used as a PROM in this study, it will be used for the socioeconomic study.||Identify differences in indication, examination and treatment between a European and Asian population.||This is an international multicenter study in cooperation with the Kyoto University Hospital in Japan.||The investigators have already detected some vital differences in the surgical approach for the patient group and further comparison will be of interest. The patients, indications, examination as well as the non-surgical and surgical treatment will be examined.||Changes in urination and sexual function in a surgical and non- surgical cohort.||Few studies address this issue, for spine patients it is of great importance and highly underreported. There are few suitable PROMS, so the investigators will use a PROM from a prior study. It is slightly different for men and women due to the differences in sex and it has no scoring system. It has not been validated, so the outcome will be slightly unsatisfactory, the positive sides convinced us to take use of the non-validated form. The investigators have had it translated into Japanese and Swedish and are interested in the Japanese contribution in regard of their cultural differences.||Quality control of the Norwegian Quality Register for Spinal Surgery. The investigators will be conducting x-ray measurements (sagittal vertical axis and pelvic parameters, lumbar lordosis) and compare it with the values that the surgeons have entered into the Norwegian quality register for spinal surgery. The measurements will be conducted by an independent radiologist at Haukeland or Oslo University Hospital in Norway and by the PhD student in Norway. It will be an inter-and intra-observer study.

If the patient is eligible to the study and agrees to join, a study number will be created using google Sheet, then the patient will be introduced to the informed consent form, paper form in Sweden and Japan, in Norway it can be signed using ""Nettskjema"" an ""Bank ID"". Nettskjema is an internet form used to create questionnaire, it is secure, but not secure enough for sensitive patient data, so the data from the forms will be imported directly to ""service for sensitive data"" (TSD). TSD is a service from Oslo University, secure for all sensitive data and in use for several prospective studies. In the homepage, the patients will, in addition to the informed consent, find the patient reported outcome measures (PROMS). The home page can be found using smartphone, tablet or computer and all forms can be filled out using the homepage. 12 months after surgery or inclusion to non-surgical treatment, the patient need to fill out the forms again. For the non-surgical treatment the homepage (Intraks.org) contains specific text, illustrations and videos with training instruction for the non-surgical treatment, developed with dedicated physiotherapists from Oslo University Hospital. The training-program consists of 3 levels of muscle core training and stretching to be exercised 1-3 times a week for 12 months. They will have a training diary to follow up the compliance that will be controlled at the 3 months follow up. The exercises are available at intraks.org as illustration, text and video.||See the protocol for detailed data collection. 4.2 Project management See protocol. 4.3 Plan for implementation||See protocol, in addition:||The ""intraks.org"" homepage will be updating the public on published articles and other activities.||4.4 Statistical analysis Altogether 75-100 patients are expected eligible for inclusion in the surgical group of WP2 annually. For the non-surgical treatment, approximately the same number will be needed. By using alfa=5% and power=80% to detect 30% ODI improvement from baseline and 30% improvement in proportion of patients that improved and calculating for 10% crossover, 10% mismatch in the propensity score matching and sufficient power for the subgroup analyzes, the study will need a total of 300 patients. Considering drop outs, the study would have enough patients after 2-3 years of inclusion.||Predictive analysis: Frequency analyses for categorical variables will be conducted via Pearson's c2 analysis. All analysis will be conducted using commercially available software (SPSS version 24, IBM Inc.) and the level of significance is set to p<0.05 in a two-sided test. For the predictive model, missing values within the database will be imputed using standard techniques such as mean and median imputation. Once a complete data set is constructed, an ensemble of decision trees will be constructed with a binary target variable that includes patients with: 1) unsatisfactory result (UR) < 30% increase from baseline ODI score (code = 0), 2) satisfactory result (SR) ≥ 30% increase from baseline ODI score (code = 1). The decision-tree algorithm is C5.0 and 5 different bootstrapped models will be built. Internal validation is accomplished via a 70/30 data split for training and testing the model, respectively. Final overall predictions from the models will be combined and chosen by voting with random selection for tied votes. Overall accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve will be calculated as well as predictor importance as determined by the model. The model will be built using commercially available software (SPSS Modeler version 24, IBM Inc.).

NCT02188576,"Introduction: Over 90% of open craniosynostosis surgical procedures are associated with a transfusion of blood or blood products. Goobie et. al. recently showed that tranexamic acid in a dose of 50 mg/kg/15min and 5 mg/kg/h significantly reduced blood loss and transfusion requirements as well as the overall exposure of children to donor PRBC by two thirds. However, using a moderately high dosing regimen, TXA plasma concentrations were shown to far exceed the accepted therapeutic level (by over 10 fold). No side effects of TXA were found in this study but a recent study suggests that currently recommended high to moderate TXA dosing regimens are potentially associated with neurological complications in children. Goobie et. al. developed a population pharmacokinetic model of TXA and simulated a dose response curve for this population. From this model and simulation, it appears that reducing the loading dose to 10 mg/kg/15 min followed by a 5 mg/kg/h infusion is adequate to maintain plasma concentrations above the accepted therapeutic level of 20ug/mL.||It is important to test and validate this reduced dosage scheme in a multicenter study. The hypothesis is that this reduced dosage scheme (10 mg/kg loading dose and 5 ug/kg/h) is as effective as the higher dosage scheme (50 mg/kg loading dose and 5 mg/kg/h) in decreasing blood loss and transfusion requirements in children undergoing open craniosynostosis surgery. Thus the PK/PD profile of TXA in craniosynostosis patients will be determined with genomics explored as a cause of interpatient variability in the response to tranexamic acid.||Experimental Design: With IRB approval and informed consent 68 pediatric patients aged 3 m to 6 years coming for open craniofacial surgery will be randomized in a prospective double blind fashion to either the current standard intravenous TXA dose (50mg/kg/15min and 5 mg/kg/h) or this lower TXA dose (10 mg/kg/15min and 5 mg/kg/h) until the end of surgery. A standardized anesthetic and well defined fluid, blood and blood product management protocols will be followed with improved modifications from the previously described protocol.||Data Analysis Plan: A preliminary power analysis indicated that a total sample size of 56 children (28 in randomized each group) would provide 80% statistical power to test whether the difference in average blood loss is equivalent to within 25% (ie 15 cc/kg) assuming a standard deviation of 30% ie +/- 22 ml/kg (moderate effect size = 0.68) . We plan to randomize 68 patients; 34 per group to ensure that we meet our sample size requirements while accounting for a potential 20% patient drop out.||Specific Aims:||Determine the efficacy of TXA (PD) in infants and children undergoing open craniofacial surgery with this lower dosage scheme.|Determine the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of TXA in infants and children undergoing open craniofacial surgery with this dosage scheme.|Determine the influence of genetics on response to TXA.|Attempt to better define efficacy of TXA in a direct manner using a novel and innovative approach by obtaining pre and post biological markers of fibrinolysis (as bleeding and blood loss are difficult to measure accurately and are an indirect measure of TXA efficacy of inhibition of fibrinolysis.",Scoliosis
NCT00527878,"Hyper-immunoglobulin E (IgE) syndrome (HIES) is a rare primary immunodeficiency characterized by eczema, recurrent skin and lung infections, elevated serum IgE, and multiple connective tissue and skeletal abnormalities. The autosomal dominant form of HIES is caused primarily by a mutation in the STAT3 gene. Patients with HIES produce IgE antibodies specific for Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus, two of the common pathogens in this population. We hypothesize that the presence of pathogen-specific IgE, combined with continuous exposure to these ubiquitous agents, leads to chronic IgE-mediated histamine release from basophils and mast cells, with subsequent pathogen-specific immune tolerance and an increase in pathogen-specific T regulatory cells. We plan to test this hypothesis through clinical and immunologic evaluation of HIES patients before, during, and after histamine-2 receptor (H2) blocker therapy with ranitidine through a prospective, placebo-controlled crossover study. We chose this therapy because histamine has been shown to stimulate interleukin-10 (IL-10), a major down regulatory cytokine, through the H2 receptor, and clinical improvement has been observed in several patients treated with H2 blockers. Laboratory studies will include determinations of pathogen-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4):IgE ratios, basophil activation, IL-10 producing regulatory T-cells, cellular proliferative responses to staphylococcal and candidal antigens, and functional testing of regulatory T-cells. Clinical evaluations will include comprehensive history and physical examination, dermatologic evaluation, genetic evaluation for clinical severity scoring of HIES, pulmonary function tests, and chest computerized tomography (CT) examination. Through this study, we will further our understanding of the immunologic abnormalities of HIES and determine whether a larger prospective, double-blind trial of H2 blockade as adjunctive therapy for HIES is indicated.",Scoliosis

NCT00018044,"The nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environmental organisms foundin soil and water that rarely cause disease in humans. Since exposure to these organisms is universal and disease is rare, it can be concluded that normal host defenses are almost always sufficient to prevent infection. It follows that otherwise healthy individuals who develop disease must have abnormal susceptibility or immune defects that permit infection with nontubercuolous mycobacteria. The organisms that are most commonly encountered in clinical practice include Mycobacterium avium, and M. intracellulare [collectively known as the M. avium complex (MAC)], M. kansasii, M. fortuitum, M. abscessus, and M. chelonae. These organisms share significant structural and biochemical similarities with their more pathogenic relative, M. tuberculosis (MTB). Recognition of host factors that predispose or lead to NTM infection may have important implications for pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention, and may be applicable to the more virulent MTB. Identification of genetic or acquired susceptibility factors may lead to recognition of endogenous pathways that can be exploited therapeutically and to possible gene identification.||Over the last two decades, three important observations have been made regarding the pathogenesis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. 1) In patients infected with HIV, nontuberculous mycobacterial infections often occur when the CD4+ T-lymphocyte number falls below 50/mm3. This suggested that specific T cell products or activities were required for mycobacterial resistance. 2) An association was noted between pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and a particular body habitus, predominantly in post-menopausal women (pectus excavatum, scoliosis, mitral valve prolapse). 3) Multiple defects have been found involving the interferon gamma synthesis and use pathways in patients with disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection without HIV, suggesting this is a critical pathway for host defense against these organisms.||We seek to better characterize the predisposition to mycobacterial infection. This study will specifically address several aspects of immune function and investigate the proposed link to body morphotype in the relevant population. By collecting this information, we hope to provide insight into disease associations, infection susceptibility, and genetic predisposition to mycobacterial infection.",Scoliosis

This study will gather historical and physical examination data to establish phenotype-genotype correlations. Data on survival and quality of life in females with RTT and males with MECP2 gene mutations will also be evaluated.||MECP2 Duplication disorder affects principally males who have one and rarely more than one additional copy of MECP2 as well as a variable number of other duplicated genes. These males have absent spoken language, shuffling gait, epilepsy, and, in some, frequent upper respiratory infections or sinusitis. Mother of these males are generally normal due to favorable skewing of X-chromosome inactivation, but in some instances may have neurodevelop-mental delays. Effective treatments are lacking. It is critical to develop phenotype-genotype correlations and longitudinal natural history data to assist the conduct of clinical trials.||RTT-related disorders feature a variety of involvements either due to MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 as well as other potential causes of atypical RTT. Phenotype-genotype studies and longitudinal natural history data are essential to the conduct of future clinical trials.||Participants in this observational study will be recruited from the four sites at which the study is being conducted, as well as through the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network and the International Rett Syndrome Association (IRSA). Prior to study entry, potential participants are expected to be tested for a mutation in the MECP2 gene. No treatment will be administered at any time during this study. Study visits will occur every 6 months until the child is 6 years old and once a year thereafter. At each study visit, participants will be examined to assess physical characteristics of the disorder, such as motor behavior and disease severity. Additionally, participants will complete questionnaires about medical history, contact information, and quality of life. The first visit will last approximately 1.5 hours, and every subsequent visit will last approximately 1 hour.",Scoliosis

The Engle Lab has investigated the genetics of complex and common strabismus and eyelid movement disorders for over 10 years and the lab's interests have expanded to include Congenital Cranial Dysinnervation Disorders (CCDDs) which are neurological disorders affecting one or more of the 12 cranial nerves. Cranial nerves control bodily functions such as movement of the eyes, transmission of visual information, smell, facial sensation, facial expression, blinking, hearing, balance, taste, chewing and swallowing.||Based on genetic studies on individuals with eye movement and eyelid disorders, the lab learned that some individuals have additional ocular defects, vascular, limb and other abnormalities. In addition, in some families relatives who carry the gene mutation may manifest the familial syndrome by having only some additional features but NOT the oculomotility disorder.

NCT02994030,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating inherited neuromuscular disorder that affects 1 in 3300 live male births (females can be mildly affected carriers). DMD causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass, with symptoms usually appearing in early childhood. DMD arises from mutations in the DMD gene that codes for dystrophin.||The DMD gene is located on the short arm of chromosome X (locus Xp21) and codes for dystrophin, containing 3685 amino acid residues. 60-65% of DMD mutations are large dele-tions, 10-30% are nonsense and frame-shift mutations, 5-15% are duplications, and 2% are intronic or 5'- and 3'-UTR alterations.Dystrophin aggregates as a homotetramer in the skeletal muscles or associates with actin and Dystrophin-Associated Glycoproteins (DAGs), forming a stable complex that interacts with laminin in the extracellular matrix. Dystrophin is considered a key structural element in the muscle fiber, whose primary function is to stabilize plasma mem-brane, while the DAGs maintain the sarcolemmal stability by mediating the complex interactions of the muscle membrane and extracellular environment. The low levels of dystrophin lead to cellular instability and progressive leakage of intracellular components, explaining the characteristically high levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in the blood of DMD patients.||Biomarkers serve as measurable indicators of normal biological or pathological processes. They are typically directly linked to genetic variants in specific genes and can predict, diagnose, monitor, and assess the severity of a disease.

NCT02738281,"At the present time, effective treatments for RTT, MECP2 Dup, or Rett-related disorders are lacking. Substantial progress has been made in RTT over the past eleven years such that this study represents a narrowing of focus to mutations or duplications of the MECP2 gene and related disorders, including those with phenotypic overlap. Understanding of RTT has advanced remarkably well through the Rett Syndrome Natural History Clinical Protocol (NHS) and correspondingly advancement in the basic science realm has moved forward with equivalent success. Thus, progress in clinical and basic science has led to the establishment of clinical trials and other translational studies that hold promise for additional clinical trials in future. In the process, however, additional MECP2- and RTT-related disorders that were unknown at the time the original proposal have been identified. In addition, substantial clinical variability in individuals with RTT that cannot be explained by differences in mutations alone must be explored further. In fact, variability among individuals with identical mutations has led to the search for additional explanations. At the time of the initial application (2002), just three years after the identification of the gene, MECP2, as the molecular link to RTT, the variation in clinical disorders related to MECP2 mutations or to the related but quite different MECP2 Dup were unknown. Each disorder is characterized by significant neurodevelopmental features related either to alterations in the MECP2 gene or related to phenotypes closely resembling those seen in individuals with RTT. Further, the phenotypic overlap with RTT due to mutations in CDKL5 and FOXG1 was also unexplored. This new study will build on the substantial progress made in understanding both classic and variant RTT and to add these related disorders, MECP2 Dup and the Rett-related disorders including CDKL5, FOXG1, and individuals with MECP2 mutations who do not have RTT. A comprehensive clinical research program will be performed including clinical, neurophysiologic, and molecular and biochemical markers across these different, but related disorders.

NCT00111384,"We hypothesize that normal germline variation in gene expression accounts, in part, for variation in the clinical severity and phenotype of the monogenic disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The phenotype of NF1 is constituted by a variety of quantifiable features; we term these features sub-phenotypes . Our main focus is on sub-phenotypes with published evidence of variation in expression from an inherited component. These include our primary sub-phenotype of spinal neurofibroma burden (quantified by MRI of spinal neurofibromas) and the secondary sub-phenotypes of dermal neurofibroma burden, head circumference, number of Lisch nodules, scoliosis, history of plexiform neurofibromas, and height. Other sub-phenotypes, as collected by a routine history and physical, will also be evaluated.||According to our hypothesis, the severity of a sub-phenotype will correlate with heritable differences in the germline expression of certain genes. As an example, consider a spectrum of individuals affected with the primary sub-phenotype of spinal neurofibroma burden. For most genes, there will be no relationship of expression level to the number of spinal neurofibromas. However, some genes will have a direct (or inverse, or other) correlation of their level of expression and the number of neurofibromas. Such genes would be considered as candidate modifier genes. The secondary sub-phenotypes will also be analyzed in a similar way. To limit false positives, candidate genes will then be tested for association (using the transmission/disequilibrium test, TDT) with the appropriate sub-phenotype.||Recruitment will be focused on identifying individuals with a range of severity of the primary sub-phenotype, spinal neurofibroma burden. We will primarily recruit post-pubertal individuals who meet the 1988 NIH criteria for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NIH Consensus Development Conference 1988). We will exclude those with recognized segmental or mosaic NF1. The rate of cutaneous neurofibroma growth and number is known to vary widely; these tumors typically appear in adolescence. For this reason we will ascertain patients after puberty. We expect most individuals to be 18 years or older, but will also accept post-pubertal pediatric patients (and use a hand film to demonstrate bone age). Parents (whether affected or not) are critical when using family-based tests of association (like the TDT) and tests of linkage and will also be recruited.||Tests of association with the TDT require trios (mother, father, proband). Multiple trios can be derived from a single family, if there are multiple affected individuals within the family. We set a recruitment goal of 100 trios and a ceiling of 1500 individuals (500 affected individuals, plus 1000 parents or additional sibs in about 400 families).||In the interest of improving care for people living with NF1, this protocol also seeks to||characterize, at the PI s discretion, individuals with unique or under-recognized features of NF1 as well as individuals with NF1-like phenotypes, including those patients with a known or suspected RAS pathway disorder.",Scoliosis

X-rays of the entire spine are carried out using EOS® technology and biodynamic measurements of the spine using the Epionics SPINE ® system. In addition, the Investigators collect the 39-item PD Questionnaires (PDQ-39), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) as clinical parameters.||Our hypotheses (I): DBS improves the sagittal balance of the spine and the pelvic rotation as a corresponding compensation mechanism for this incorrect posture (II) The participant's mobility improves in course of DBS in terms of scope and speed (III) In course after DBS, back pain is significantly reduced and the participant's everyday life is easier to cope with.||The investigators hope to gain new insights into the pathophysiology of the spinal deformities associated with Parkinson's disease from the study and to expand the indication for DBS to include clinically relevant spinal complaints.||Consent to the study||The study was positively assessed by the Charité ethics committee and the Federal Office for Radiation Protection.||Consent for study inclusion is sought after explanation and agreement to DBS treatment for participants with Parkinson's disease. Thus, participants capable of consenting to the DBS treatment get the study details explained themselves and may or may not agree to participate.

NCT04166981,"Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common disease with a large impact on the quality of life of the patient. LSS is defined as narrowing of the spinal canal, nerve root canal or intervertebral foramina. Spinal stenosis is caused by degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, including thickening of the ligamentum flavum, osteophyte formation and disc protrusion. Pain is worse with standing upright and with exercise, and relieved with spine flexion or sitting down.||In the Wakayama Spine Study, investigators found radiographic severe spinal stenosis, defined as narrowing of more than two-thirds of the spinal canal area, in 30,4% of all patients, but only 17,5% were symptomatic.||Many of the patients suffering from LSS are pensioners, with an average age of 65 years. With current changes in demographics and the aging global population it is estimated that prevalence of LSS will increase to nearly 60% by 2025.||In a Danish epidemiological study, degenerative spondylolisthesis was found in 2,7% of men and 8,4% of women above 50 years. Every year, more than 3500 patients aged 60 and above are referred to Center of Spine Surgery Middelfart for LSS. According to the national Danish surgical spine database, DaneSpine, 7936 patients with LSS had surgery during a period from 2009-2013.||Patients suffering from LSS and instability are treated with decompression and posterolateral spinal fusion with or without instrumentation. According to DaneSpine, this group of patients showed improvements on both physical and psychological parameters. In countries outside of Scandinavia, these patients are usually treated with decompression and posterolateral spinal fusion with supplementary pedicle screw fixation. Instrumentation with pedicle screws and rods provides an internal splint, preventing motion during fusion healing. The fusion rate in non-instrumented arthrodesis is reported to be as low as 30-45% In contrast the fusion rate with instrumented arthrodesis have been reported to be above 80%. Although some studies have shown similar outcomes after decompression with or without instrumentation, long-term follow up has shown that a solid fusion improves clinical outcome.||In recent retrospective studies, the spinal sagittal balance, specifically the sagittal vertical axis (SVA) has been shown to affect the outcome of patients undergoing laminectomy. Decompression surgery has been shown to improve sagittal balance in patients with a preoperative imbalance, compared to patients treated with rehabilitation. The preoperative sagittal imbalance has not been shown to significantly affect health-related quality of life(HRQoL)outcomes although a residual imbalance after decompression is related to a poorer outcome. No prospective studies to our knowledge have compared the sagittal balance and outcomes in patients with spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis, treated with decompression and spinal fusion with or without supplemental pedicle screw fixation.",Scoliosis

In the literature, there are only one study concerning this aspect, conducted on an adult population with the help of a static posturography.||Our study will focus on pediatric patients, who will be evaluated by a dynamic posturography, the Equitest platform (NeuroCom, Clackamas, OR). This platform is able to quantify the contribution of each of the three sensory informations (visual, vestibular and somatosensory) necessary to maintain equilibrium, realising a specific test (Sensory Organisation Test).||The Equitest can elaborate a Composite Equilibrium Score (CES), that will be our PRIMARY JUDGMENT CRITERIA.||Only patients for which ENT evaluation is indicated for medical reasons (for example, children presented frequent falls, dizziness, nystagmus, motion sickness...) will be evaluated.||This evaluation won't change habitual neurosurgical care for the patients presenting Chiari I malformation, so two groups of patients will be identified: children who will be operated on and children who won't. CES of the two groups will be calculated and compared.||Furthermore, we will compared CES results of the operated patients group before and after surgery, to evaluate the impact of surgery on postural control.||In parallel, we will evaluate others SECONDARY CRITERIA in operated patient, before and after surgery, such as :||signe and symptomss modification;|decompression result on MRI images;|syringomyelia modification, if present before;|central apnea syndrome modification, if present before;|scoliosis modification, if present before;|behavioral modification. Anamnestic and clinical data will be part of the habitual computerized medical folder, as well as polysomnographic, posturographic and imaging ones.||Clinical elements of recruited patients will be collected by principal investigator in an anonymous database, secured by a password.||Concerning primary criteria, collected qualitative data will be analysed by Chi-2 or Fischer test, while quantitative ones will be analysed by Student's test or Mann-Whitney one.||Concerning secondary criteria, collected qualitative data will be analysed by Mc Nemar test or symmetry test, while quantitative ones will be analysed by Student's test Wilcoxon one.",Scoliosis

NCT02598700,"In total hip arthroplasty (THA), incorrect cup orientation markedly increases the risk of dislocation, wear, and impingement. The primary method of cup placement is based on the surgeon's interpretation of orientation within a ""safe zone"" defined by Lewinnek almost 40 years ago. This approach has undergone little change despite consistent dislocation rates and a large proportion of dislocations occurring in patients with cups within the safe zone. One reason for this may be that it does not account for a patient's natural pelvic posture, which affects the functional cup anteversion. Some modern techniques of cup placement assess a functional anteversion based on supine and others on standing orientation. However, these methods do not account for lumbar mobility and the effects on spinopelvic mechanics when in the seated position, the most common position in which dislocation occurs. The investigators have shown that patients with lumbar fusion have a higher rate of THA dislocation. This risk also correlated with length of fusion construct. This suggests that decreased lumbar mobility, whether a result of arthrodesis, disease or age related degeneration, may play an important role in the risk of THA dislocation. Some studies have measured change in pelvic orientation and cup anteversion between sitting and standing. Others have used modeling to estimate change in functional anteversion based on pelvic tilt. Presently, however, there are no studies that have investigated the quantitative relationship, in vivo, between patient-specific changes in spinopelvic parameters and cup anteversion between sitting and standing. Within this exploration, identification of an appropriate safe zone in individuals with mobility restrictions of the lumbar spine is not possible.||The investigators will test the hypothesis by addressing the aims presented below. These aims will be approached by directly measuring the spinopelvic parameters on standing and seated radiographs in 100 patients who have undergone primary THA. Computer models of cups and pelvises generated from patient-specific pelvis CTs will be manipulated based on the measured changes in pelvic alignment. The change in functional cup anteversion will then be directly measured from each patient's model.||Specific Aim #1: To quantify the relationship between the change in pelvic tilt and functional acetabular cup anteversion between the standing and sitting positions in patients who have undergone primary THA. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a directly proportional relationship between the increase in pelvic tilt and increase in functional anteversion. The investigators anticipate that Aim #1 will identify the importance of functional anteversion in the seated position and support its consideration when defining a patient-specific cup safe zone. This data will serve as the foundation for development of a clinical tool used in pre-operative planning and post- operative rehabilitation that accounts for spinopelvic mechanics to maintain safe cup orientation when in the vulnerable seated position.||Specific Aim #2: To quantify the relationship between the change in lumbar lordosis and functional acetabular cup anteversion between the standing and sitting positions in patients who have undergone primary THA. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a directly proportional relationship between the decrease in lumbar lordosis and increase in functional anteversion and that patients with history of lumbar immobility will have decreased change in functional anteversion. The data obtained in Aim #2 can be used to identify those at increased risk of dislocation. It will also provide insight into, and a basis for further study of, the relationship between seated functional anteversion and specific etiologies of lumbar immobility (spinal fusion, ankylosing spondylitis, flat back syndrome, degenerative changes, etc.) that may affect THA dislocation.||The overall objective of this study is to define a clinically relevant and applicable quantitative correlation between the change in spinopelvic parameters and change in functional anteversion between the standing and seated positions and challenge the historical safe zone paradigm. The central hypothesis is that the change spinopelvic mobility correlates with the change in functional anteversion. The investigators believe that this quantitative relationship will provide the clinician a tool to identify at-risk THA candidates and make appropriate patient-specific modifications to cup anteversion and post-operative rehabilitation.",Scoliosis

NCT03495661,"Background||Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is characterized by low back and leg pain, walking disturbances and sometimes instability, impaired balance and numbness of the lower limbs. This condition is caused by degenerative changes in the lumbar spine including bulging discs, osteophytes from the arthritic facet joints and thickened ligamentum flavum which together cause narrowing of the spinal canal and thus affect the lumbar nerve roots. LSS affects mainly older populations and is unusual under 50 years old. This diagnosis is attracting more and more interest due to the aging population with increasing demands for physical activity. LSS is the most common indication for spinal surgery. The surgical treatment involves relieving the pressure from the nerve structures in the stenotic segments through a posterior approach. The hypertrophic ligaments and parts of the facet joints are removed (i.e., decompression). Adding fusion to the decompression for stabilization of the decompressed segment has not been shown to provide superior results than decompression alone. In several studies, surgery has been shown to have better results than the conservative treatment. However, methodological difficulties and a large proportion of cross-over in these studies indicate that there is still uncertainty about whether surgery is generally a better option.||After decompression, only 60-70% of patients reported to be satisfied with the result and a minor proportion of them experienced even no improvement at all [Strömqvist]. Conservative treatment has shown in some studies to have good results for some patient groups and other studies have shown that the benefit of the surgical treatment decreases over time and that physical exercise may reduce the need for surgery. Moreover, surgery itself has a positive placebo effect that can improve symptoms in some diseases.||It has been speculated whether the compression of the nerve roots causes in some patients permanent nerve damage with muscle denervation, while in other cases a reinnervation and recovery of the function may occur. Results from neurography and EMG studies have been shown these modalities to have a possible predictive value for the natural process of LSS. If a neurophysiological examination could be able to predict which patients are able to benefit from surgery, many patients could avoid surgery and the risks involved in it.||The degeneration of the lumbar spine is progressively impairing the spinal sagittal balance. The need to make extensive correction and fusion in addition to the decompression in order to restore the sagittal balance is debated among spinal surgeons. The experience gained from previous RCTs is that the patients' back pain is reduced by decompression only. Many patients also report that their posture improved after decompression alone.||Previous trials in the connective tissue and blood samples have shown that proinflammatory factors and nociceptors (molecules that induce pain) are upregulated in patients with patellar tendinosis which is an inflammatory condition. Changes in the connective tissue that cause LSS are mainly inflammatory (arthritic facet joints and ligamentum flavum) and a possible theory around LSS pathophysiology may be that the nerves are biologically affected by proinflammatory factors and nociceptors. Identification of some of these factors could lead to better explanation of the pathomechanism behind the nerve compression in LSS and to the development of future pharmacological treatments to be used in conjunction with surgery.||Aims||The aim of this study is primarily to evaluate whether surgery with decompression leads to superior results than the non-surgical treatment with structured physical therapy. For this evaluation, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) will be used.||The main secondary aim is to investigate by means of Neurography and EMG, whether the degree of neurological affection caused by nerve compression affects the outcome of surgery for LSS.||Aims The aim of this study is primarily to evaluate whether surgery with decompression leads to superior results than the non-surgical treatment with structured physical therapy.

During the last appointment, approximately 2 years after beginning of the study, a standing lateral thoracolumbar radiograph is taken to detect if the patient has developed spondylolisthesis. Trunk strength and spinal mobility is measured at follow-up visits (4 months, 12months, and 24months).||SRS-24 questionnaire is a translated and modified version of the Scoliosis Research Society-22 questionnaire.

Patient draws his/her pain in a line from 0 to 10. During each appointment a patient is asked to describe their back pain and/or lower extremity pain in this scale as it is included in both pain drawing and ODI.||Trunk strength and spinal mobility tests are used to evaluate the effect of the use of the brace to the muscles and movement of the trunk. The centimeters with a tape measure from the fingertips on the thigh in side-bend are measured and we grade it abnormal, if the measurement is over 2 standard deviations under the mean of the Finnish reference values (20). Non-dynamometric trunk performance is measured with repetitive sit-up, arch-up and squatting tests. The result is graded from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). 1 refers to 1 standard deviation or more below the mean of the normal Finnish population values and 5 to 1 standard deviation or more above this mean (21).||In MRI, from the T2 spin-echo weighted images disc degeneration is graded based on Pfirrmann classification.

NCT04533178,"A clinical trial will be conducted comparing healing of an acute posterior lumbar vertebra stress reaction in children treated either with cessation of sports activities for a period of six weeks and wearing a soft spinal brace 16 hours per day or cessation of sports activities only. Inclusion criteria will be a child or an adolescent aged between 8 and 18 years with a posterior lumbar vertebra stress reaction uni- or bilaterally in one or more lumbar vertebra. Bone marrow edema in the dorsal parts of the lumbar spine must be confirmed in a recent (under 3 weeks) MRI examination. Exclusion criteria will be a fracture line (spondylolysis), spondylolisthesis or other abnormalities on lumbar CT examination. Other exclusion criteria are skeletal disorder or not consenting to be a patient in this study.||110 Patients/ participants are randomized into two groups. The first group of 55 patients is treated with cessation of all sports activities and a soft spinal brace. The other group is treated only with cessation of sports activities. Treatment in both groups is 6 weeks, starting at doctor's appointment after all necessary examinations are complete. Minimum follow-up will be 6 months.||In the beginning of this study a blood plasma vitamin D values will be measured from all our patients. Patients with D-vitamin values below 50 nmol/l will receive vitamin D prescription.||Lateral x-ray picture of the lumbar spine is taken with axial loading (standing) from all study patients at the beginning and at the end (6 months) of the study. This enables to see the possible change in sacral slope during the 6-month follow-up. The possible change will then indicate a change in lumbar posture during this time. This is important to clarify whether lumbar posture has a role in the etiology - and treatment - of lumbar vertebra stress injury.||According to statistical power analysis a total of 110 patients - 55 in each group- will be needed to provide evidence for the effectiveness or no effectiveness of a soft spinal brace on the natural history of pars interarticularis stress reaction.||Primary outcome is the change in stress reaction on MRI at 6 weeks compared to pre-treatment MRI.||Secondary outcomes are:||SRS-24 - (Scoliosis Research Society) score at the beginning of the treatment and during the six-month follow-up ( at 0, 6 weeks, 6 months appointments)|Back and lower extremity pain at the beginning of the treatment and during the six months follow-up (pain drawing including VAS-score (Visual Analogue Pain Score) in children under 16 years old, Oswestry disability index including VAS-score in patients over 16 years old)|Relapse of symptoms during the six months follow-up|Vitamin D values at the beginning of the study|""Pain time table"" during the 6-week period of treatment - to clarify the moment of ending of pain during treatment.|Change in sacral slope on lateral lumbar x-ray with axial loading during the 6 months of follow-up.|Pain in one-legged back extension test at 0, 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up appointments",Scoliosis
NCT04478981,"Rationale: Patients with mutations in the SELENON gene suffer from slowly progressive congenital muscular dystrophy with early onset rigidity of the spine and potentially life-threatening respiratory insufficiency. The protein encoded by SELENON, selenoprotein-1, functions as an endogeneous antioxidant and executes a role in cellular redox metabolism. The first results of an intervention study using KH176, currently under development for mitochondrial disease, in an animal model (Sepn1 knock out zebrafish) showed improved muscular function. Patients with mutations in LAMA2 gene causing merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A) have a similar phenotype as those with mutations in SELENON gene. Key characteristics include congenital hypotonia, delayed motor development and contractures. For them no treatment is available either. Since not much is known about the clinical progression of these two congenital muscle diseases, there is an urgent need for natural history-outcome measure studies to reach trial-readiness enabling smooth transition towards clinical trials.||Objective: The primary objective is to identify and follow (i.e. describe the natural history of) patients with congenital myopathy/muscular dystrophy due to mutations in SELENON- or LAMA2 genes. The secondary objectives are: 1. to select appropriate outcome measures based on the natural history data. 2. to determine the necessity for routine cardiological and respiratory screening.||Study design: This is an observational study. A standard medical history, neurological examination, functional measures, questionnaires, cardiac examination, respiratory function tests, radiological examination (qualitative and quantitative full body MRI, muscle ultrasound, DEXA scan, X-ray of the spine) and accelerometry will be performed. For each participant, the investigators will perform four six-monthly measurements over an one-and-a-half year period. If more than 20 patients are willing to participate in this study, the investigators will select per muscle disease 10 participants that are representative of the entire patient population (based on age, gender, disease severity etc.). Patients that are not included in this study and patients that are not able to or do not wish to visit the Radboudumc will be retrospectively analyzed through medical records. Additionally, they will receive questionnaires, which can be completed at home.||Study population: all patients with congenital myopathy/muscular dystrophy due to mutations in the SELENON or LAMA2 genes.||Risk and benefit assessment: This study does not concern any product (medicinal product, food product, or medical device). There is a small risk for minor injury, e.g. when a participant falls. However, since the investigators use all functional test using movements to which most participants are familiar (i.e. walking, transfers, etc), the participant will be able to estimate his/her own risk. The investigators don't include tests in which they push participants to their physical limits. The investigators conclude that this study has a negligible risk. A benefit includes the possibility for participants to get a detailed analysis on their own health. Additionally, participants will contribute to the design of future clinical trials on possible treatment options.",Scoliosis

NCT01751685,"The experimental interventions will be provided in small groups meeting three sessions per week for 6 months. At baseline and 6 months after the intervention, we will measure kyphosis, physical function, spine muscle strength and density, and quality of life. We will assess the effect of the intervention on the co-primary outcomes of kyphosis, modified Physical Performance Test (PPT) and gait speed measured as change over 6 months. We will also assess the effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes of physical function and health-related quality of life, measured as change in Timed Up and Go, Timed Loaded Standing, Six-Minute Timed Walk, the Scoliosis Research Society SRS-30, PROMISe Global Health and physical function and PACE questionnaires. Furthermore, we will investigate whether changes in kyphosis, spinal muscle strength and/or density mediate the effect of the intervention on change in physical function. After the 6-month intervention, both groups will continue their usual activity and we will assess the durability of the effects of the intervention at 1-year follow-up.",Scoliosis
NCT01766674,"Participants assigned to the intervention group will receive a high-intensity spinal strengthening group exercise program for 1 hour twice per week for 12 weeks, with home practice.
